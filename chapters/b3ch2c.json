I think 'Barry' is a wonderful name!\"<br/>\"Hey, thanks, Doc!\" we hear a voice coming from the transceiver. \"But why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?\"<br/><br/>\"I wasn't talking to you...\" Leila's father says, as he puts the transceiver next to his mouth again. \"I was speaking with another Barry which-- you know what, never mind that! Do you think you can teleport us safely? Can you tell where we are from the signal of this transceiver?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I can get a good reading on you,\" the voice from the transceiver says. \"Should I teleport you right now?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Leila's father says. \"But make sure you transport all of us. We wouldn't want anyone to get left behind.\"<br/><br/>\"Roger that,\" the voice from the transceiver says. \"Here we go!\"<br/><br/> As soon as the voice stops talking, we all feel ourselves getting teleported out of the alleyway, as a white light begins to envelop us. A few moments later, we find ourselves standing in the middle of a dimly lit cave, in which the only source of light we have are some glowing blue crystals embedded in the walls. Upon looking around myself, I realize that the walls and the high ceiling are all made of seredium, and there are also some peculiar looking plants growing in this cave, which can probably only be found in underground places such as this.<br/>The man named Barry that Leila's father was talking to earlier is standing behind some sort of metal desk with several buttons on it, and behind him, there is this very big metal device with many lights of different colors illuminating it, which I can only assume is the teleporter that was used to transport us here. I did hear that Varathians had access to technology such as this, and I'm pretty sure that it is through the use of one such device that we were brought here, to this continent, but this is the first time I've had the chance of seeing one up close.<br/><br/>\"Thank you, Barry, for bringing us here,\" Leila's father says, to the man behind the desk.<br/><br/> \"You're welcome, Doc,\" the man behind the desk says. \"But who are all these people? Friends of yours?\"<br/>\"This is my daughter, Leila,\" Leila's father says, as he points towards her. \"I believe I've already spoken to you about her on several occasions. And these are Leila's friends, who helped her reach Ollendor. Sadly, I haven't had the time to learn their names yet. Leila, could you please introduce us?\"<br/><br/>Leila nods, and she displays each of our names above our heads, written in her usual blue writing.<br/><br/>\"Pleased to meet you all!\" Leila's father says. \"I am Reidzek, these two beside me are Peter and Albert, and that man over there by the desk is Barry, as you already know.\"<br/><br/>",

Reminds me of how I used to be friends with two other Barrys when I was a kid, and how we all had to give ourselves nicknames to keeps things from becoming too confusing.\"<br/>\"Yeah, that's how we did it in my homeland too,\" Hadrik says. \"Whenever there were other Hadriks around, people just used to call me 'dwarf'. Maybe we could find some nickname for our Barry too. Like Barry, the improviser. Or Barry, the reckless.\"<br/><br/>\"Just 'Barry' is fine, thank you very much,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Don't be like that, 'reckless',\" Hadrik says with a grin. \"I'm sure we could find a nickname that would be to your liking. Or we could add your father's name at the end of your own name, kinda like how those nobles from the Western Continent like to add their family names at the end sometimes, to make themselves feel more important! What do you say?\"<br/><br/>\"You don't have to force him to use a nickname if he doesn't want to,\" the man behind the desk says. \"I already have an old nickname that I'm used to, so you can call me by that name, if you feel that it would be less confusing. My old nickname used to be 'thundercloud'.\"<br/><br/> \"Hey, that's not a bad nickname,\" Hadrik says. \"Alright, then, thundercloud... would you mind telling us what exactly is this place? Have we been teleported below the city, or?...\"<br/>\"Uh... I think so...\" the man behind the desk says. \"I remember that they told me about it during my initial briefing, but it's been a long time since then. Doctor, you had your briefing somewhat recently. Do you remember if the teleporter is located below Ollendor or not?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, this teleporting device was placed somewhere below the center of the city, I believe,\" Leila's father says. \"But we are very far below. This ceiling that you see high above us is made up of a massive layer of seredium, and as far as I know, there is no other way to reach the surface than to use this teleporter. These underground tunnels stretch for miles and miles, however, so it is not impossible that there is some exit that leads to the surface somewhere, but it's like a huge labyrinth down here, so you would be more likely to get lost and starve to death, than to find your way out.\"<br/><br/> \"How did you manage to find us?\" Leila writes. \"Were you just passing by, or did somebody tell you that we would be there?\"<br/>\"We've been following you since you entered the city,\" says one of Reidzek's two bodyguards, who is called Albert. \"The two of us, I mean. Not doctor Reidzek. The doctor told us once that his daughter had silver hair, so as soon as we saw you and your group, we immediately contacted Barry over here, so he could tell the doctor and teleport him to the surface. When we saw you pick a fight with the royal guards, we panicked a little, but we managed to convince the king of the underground to send some of our men to create a diversion at the temple where they were holding the ceremony, in the hopes that this would get the royal guards off your back.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait a second...\" Daren says. \"So you're saying that you are the ones who set off that explosion?\"<br/><br/>\"Some of our comrades did, yes,\" Albert says. \"We knew that the king tends to teleport the royal guards to his position, whenever he feels that his life may be in danger, so we figured that an explosion should be more than enough to scare him a little.\"<br/><br/>",

Not to mention that most of our air is coming from these plants you see growing on the walls, and there just aren't enough of them to provide a suitable environment for that many people.\"<br/><br/>\"I've never seen plants like these before,\" Daren says, as he is still limping, closely behind us. \"What are they called?\"<br/><br/> \"I don't think anyone has named them yet,\" Leila's father says, \"but they seem to be a special kind of plant that has adapted to survive with only the few nutrients provided by these seredium rocks, and the dim light coming from these blue crystals. They must also have very strong roots, because these seredium walls are most certainly not easy to cut through.\"<br/>\"Oh, I just remembered something that I forgot to tell you all!\" Albert says. \"These thick seredium walls and ceiling make it almost impossible to contact anyone from the outside through a transceiver, so if you ever want to send a message to anyone on the surface, you'll need to contact Barry, or go to the teleporter room yourself, because that's the only place where there is little enough seredium in the ceiling that it doesn't completely block all of the magical waves sent by the transceiver.\"<br/><br/>\"Speaking of that teleporter...\" I say. \"Would it happen to be the same teleporting device that transported us tournament participants to Varathia, by any chance?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, no, no!\" Albert says. \"Most definitely not. This teleporter barely covers the range of this city, and that's only because it has been placed right in the middle of it. I don't think there are more than a few teleporters on this island that are powerful enough to teleport you on one of the other continents, and they must all be very heavily guarded. I am quite certain that no such teleporter can be found in Ollendor, however.\"<br/><br/>",

She became one later.\"<br/><br/>\"I see...\" Peter says, not really knowing what else to say.<br/><br/>\"Also, I share this body with a little girl named Flower, who can cast magic as well,\" Illuna says. \"The fire jets you saw earlier were coming from her, not from me.\"<br/><br/>\"You share the body?...\" Peter says, in a slight state of shock. \"With your host?\"<br/><br/>\"Ooooh!\" Albert says. \"So that's why there were two names above your head when doctor Reidzek's daugher did the introductions!

Please have a seat. In the meantime, Peter and I will go notify the king of your arrival.\"<br/>As we are talking, a man in his forties with a scar on his left eye and a rugged look about him slowly begins to approach us, from the other end of the room. He seems to be one of the local mages, judging by his aura and by the warning sign I'm seeing above his head, although I can't tell if he's a weapon enchanter or if he has some other specialization. He has a sword hanging from his belt and he is wearing leather armor, but he is also holding a staff in his right hand, which I'm assuming he uses for casting spells.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Albert!\" the man says, as he gets closer to us. \"Are these the outsiders that Barry told us about, earlier?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, these are the ones,\" Albert says.<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" the man says, looking somewhat impressed. \"So they're still not dead after facing the royal guards by themselves? Not bad... Not bad at all!\"<br/><br/>\"They've only met three of the royal guards,\" Albert says. \"The captain, the mercenary and the giant. The other members of the guard must have been busy with some different mission.\"<br/><br/> \"You guys had a run-in with the captain?\" the man with the scar says, as he looks at us, surprised. \"That would explain why you all look so beaten up. Tell me, what kind of madness possessed you when you decided to illegally infiltrate one of the most well-guarded cities on this continent?\"<br/><br/>",

We have reasons to believe that the Overseer has plans of its own, although it is unclear to us what exactly it is trying to accomplish. In either case, if we were to win it to our side, we would potentially gain a great ally, because those 'drowns' are most certainly a force to be reckoned with.\"<br/><br/>\"Why do you people keep calling them 'drowns'?\" Melindra says. \"I'm pretty sure the correct name was 'droons'.

Listen, it doesn't really matter what he calls them. The name is stupid anyway.

It won't happen again...\"<br/><br/>\"Sorry about that,\" Albert tells us, and then he turns to his friend. \"Let's go, Peter!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, it's... no trouble,\" Daren says, as he looks with a somewhat worried expression in his eyes at the girl and the two men slowly walking towards the end of the long hall.<br/><br/>",

All of her family had been taken away by the city guards, and she had nowhere to go. Her father and brother were mages, and they both disappeared without a trace from their homes one night, never to be heard from again. They aren't the only mages that have been taken away by guards all of a sudden, without any explanation, in the past few years. These sorts of situations have been happening increasingly more often as the years went by, and people barely have the courage to talk about it anymore, out of fear that they may become the next ones to get dragged out of their homes in the middle of the night, if they are not careful with their words.\"<br/><br/>\"Do you have any idea why they might be doing this?\" Daren asks Breynan, as I see Albert and Peter stopping in the middle of the room to have a discussion with one of their friends, while the little girl is just standing there, with her head bowed down.<br/><br/> \"Given that the majority of their targets so far have been mages,\" Breynan says, \"we're thinking that they may be taking them to those large black towers, coated with seredium. I don't know if you've seen how they work, but those towers are basically the main source of magical energy for all of the gadgets in this city, from the flying metal carriages, to those metal balls roaming the skies. The energy in those towers is coming from all the mages that you see standing on the flying platforms on the side of them, and also from all the mages that are inside the towers. These people work all day to transfer magical energy to the tower, and in return, they get paid for their services. But I think Billy Bob wasn't happy with the amount of energy he was getting from voluntary work, so he decided to have some of the mages kidnapped, so they could work day and night at the towers, without pay. We don't know this for certain, of course. So far, it is only speculation on our part.\"<br/>\"Have you not been to those towers to see if you could find the girl's father and brother there?\" Daren says.<br/><br/> \"We tried, but those areas are heavily guarded,\" Breynan says. \"We would risk too many of our men just to confirm our theory, and then we'd need a whole battalion to actually free the slaves. As cruel as this may sound, there are unfortunately more important things to spend our resources on than finding a little girl's family.\"<br/>\"What about the girl's mother?\" Hadrik asks. \"Do you know what happened to her?\"<br/><br/>\"Her mother went missing shortly after she began asking the city guards to investigate why her husband and son had disappeared,\" Breynan says. \"She must have insisted a little too much and gotten on one of the guards' nerves. Only the gods know where she may be now... If she is still alive, that is.\"<br/><br/>As I look towards the other end of the hall again, I see that Albert and Peter have finished their conversation with their friend, and they are almost about to exit the room, with the little girl following close behind.<br/><br/>",

No, let go of me, what are you doing? I said let go! You can't do this to me. You can't!\"<br/><br/>The old man's voice is becoming more and more muffled as the men on the inside are dragging him further into the quarantine area, until eventually the voice can no longer be heard anymore and the hallway becomes silent once again.<br/><br/>\"Okay, what the HELL was that?!\" Hadrik asks Breynan, after a few moments of us just staring at the iron door, without saying anything.<br/><br/> \"Listen, I know what this looks like from an outsider's perspective, but we don't exactly have a lot of options, here...\" Breynan says. \"There is a terrible disease currently plaguing our city, and sometimes the men we send out on missions happen to catch it. We don't know where it's coming from, we don't know what it is, and we have no way of curing it. All we know is that once you get it, there are three pink spots that immediately appear on the back of your neck, and then exactly a week after that, you start getting the very first symptoms of the disease, and your illness becomes contagious. Once the sickness really starts kicking in, you're going to get violent coughs, a high fever, and eventually you won't even be able to get out of bed anymore. Nobody who contracted this disease has ever managed to live through it. The only thing we can do is to isolate everyone who becomes ill, so that we can at least keep our casualties to a minimum.\"<br/>\"No...\" Daren says. \"No, this isn't right... You can't just abandon these people like this. There has to be a way to save them. I'm going in there!\"<br/><br/> \"No, wait, you're not allowed to--\" Breynan starts to say, but Daren does not listen to him and he storms right past us, straight for the iron door, at a speed that makes it look like he's completely forgotten that he is still in pain from the beating he's taken earlier.<br/>\"I'll go get him...\" I tell Breynan, as I rush to follow Daren.<br/><br/>Before I manage to catch up to him, however, Daren calls out to the guard in front of the iron door, asking to be allowed inside the quarantine zone.<br/><br/>\"Open the door, please!\" Daren tells the guard, and then he stops in front of him. \"I want to take a look inside, and see if I can help.\"<br/><br/>Realizing that I'm already too late, I place myself not too far behind Daren and I decide to wait and see what their conversation will lead to. <br/><br/>\"Nobody is allowed inside the quarantine zone,\" says Desmond, the guard. \"Especially not outsiders. Go back to your chair and wait for the king to summon you. There is nothing for you to see here.\"<br/><br/>\"No, you don't understand!\" Daren says. \"I am a healer. If you let me in there, I might find a way to cure them!\"<br/><br/>",

But this disease is nothing like that 'Iknar' plague that you are so famous for having cured all by yourself. We have many skilled healers here, and all of them said that they haven't seen anything like it before. We already lost two of our best healers to this plague before we realized that there is nothing that can be done to stop it. I won't let you waste your life away as well.\"<br/>\"So you're just going to let them all die in front of your eyes?\" Daren says, furiously. \"They are your friends!\"<br/><br/>\"Don't you dare lecture me, healer,\" Desmond says, in a tone that suggests he is barely able to contain his rage. \"I've already lost my wife to this disease, and I am about to lose my brother too, in a few days. If I'm telling you that it can't be done, then it can't be done! You're just going to throw your life away for nothing! Don't you get it? There's nothing you can do to save them. It doesn't matter how good of a healer you are. Nobody can achieve the impossible!\"    <br/><br/> \"That doesn't mean that I can't still try!\" Daren says, with a very determined look in his eyes. \"Listen to me, Desmond. When I came here to this tournament, I promised myself that I wouldn't get distracted. I swore that I would focus on my goal of winning the tournament regardless of what would happen, because winning the Magium is what's most important. If I were to win the Magium, everything else that I couldn't do before would become possible, and I could potentially save tens of thousands of lives in the time that would have normally taken me to save only one. But none of that matters right now. None of it matters, because by the time I'll win the tournament... by the time I'll finally gain access to the Magium... all of those people behind that door will be long dead, and I cannot let that happen. I would never be able to forgive myself if I did.\"<br/>Daren then takes one step forward, and he puts both his hands on the guard's shoulders, as he looks him straight in the eye.<br/><br/> \"Desmond, please... let me in,\" Daren says. \"Let me in, so I can go save your brother...\"<br/>It seems that the rage in Desmond's eyes has disappeared, and now he is giving Daren a long, thoughtful look, probably trying to decide if he should put his trust in him or not. <br/><br/>\"You are insane, healer!\" Desmond tells Daren after a while, as he pushes both his hands away from his shoulders. \"You are a madman and a fool! Even more of a fool than that idiot Kelrim.\"<br/><br/>The guard then begins opening the locks one by one, until he's finally done with them, and then he opens the iron door.<br/><br/>\"Do as you wish,\" Desmond says. \"But know that you only have one week at your disposal. If in one week you don't make any progress, you either keep out of our base, or we'll lock you in with the rest of them. Don't say that I didn't warn you.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you,\" Daren says. \"I'll make sure not to waste this chance you've given me.\"<br/><br/>Daren then turns towards me.<br/><br/>\"Let's go, Barry!\" he says.<br/><br/>",

Just as we are beginning to get a better understanding of how things are working in Ollendor, both above ground and below it, we see the iron door opening, as Daren limps out of the quarantine area, with a goblin dressed in white mage robes following close behind him.<br/>\"A goblin?...\" Illuna asks surprised, when the two of them reach us.<br/><br/> \"Yes, this is Kelrim,\" Daren says. \"A goblin white mage who has been volunteering to treat the sick people in the quarantine area for the past two weeks.\"<br/>\"Two weeks?\" I ask. \"Shouldn't that mean that his disease is contagious by now?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Daren says. \"Apparently, this sickness develops more slowly for goblins than it does for humans, so he should still have around two more weeks before he needs to be locked in the quarantine area with the others.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay...\" I say. \"But why did you bring him with you?\"<br/><br/>\"I brought him here because he wants to find a cure to this sickness just as much as I do,\" Daren says. \"He also helped me out a lot by casting a protection spell on me that shielded me temporarily from the disease, and it is thanks to him that I managed to figure out the true nature of this illness.\"<br/><br/>\"Daren, working together with a monster?\" Hadrik says. \"Now there's something that I never thought I'd see in this lifetime!\"<br/><br/>\"The healer speaks the truth!\" Breynan says, after inspecting the back of Daren's neck. \"That temporary spell he spoke of really did manage to protect him from the disease!\"<br/><br/>",

Lead the way!\" I say.<br/>\"So, there were two mad fools instead of one...\" Desmond says, as he looks at me.<br/><br/>\"Well, I suppose they don't call me 'Barry the reckless' for nothing,\" I say. \"See you later!\"<br/><br/>Having said that, I go to follow Daren inside the quarantine area, and as soon as we both enter, Desmond closes the door behind us and then locks it up once again. We now find ourselves within a small corridor that is being lit by two torches, and at the end of the tunnel, there is another iron door, which does not appear to have any locks on it.<br/><br/>As we approach the door, we begin hearing the voice of the old man who got thrown in here earlier, and it seems that he is having an argument with a few of the other sick people in the quarantine area.<br/><br/>\"Get a hold of yourself, Jack,\" says one of the guys beyond the door, as Daren and I make our way through the corridor. \"You've done nothing but whine constantly ever since you got here. We even had to drag you away from the entrance, so you wouldn't bother anyone in the waiting room. Can you not at least try to enjoy your last few days of relatively good health while you still have them? Come here. Grab a beer. Play some cards with us. We're all in this together, after all. There's no need to make this even more depressing than it already is.\"<br/><br/> The men suddenly stop talking when Daren and I open the iron door and make our way into the very large room that they are in. As we take a look around, we see that there is a table set up near the entrance, where the old man Jack and a few other younger men are having a beer and playing some cards. The rest of the room is full of sick people lying on their beds, coughing violently or just simply staring at the ceiling. And in the middle of all these people, to our surprise, we see a lone goblin dressed in white mage robes that is currently walking from one bed to another, tending to the sick, while apparently being too focused on his work to have noticed us entering the room.<br/>\"A goblin?...\" Daren asks, seemingly in a state of shock. \"A goblin is the one taking care of all these people?\"<br/><br/>After staring at the goblin for a few seconds, dumbfounded, Daren immediately snaps out of it, when he sees the goblin casting a healing spell on one of the patients.<br/><br/>\"No, no, no!\" Daren says loudly, and then he begins limping in a hurry towards the goblin. \"That's not how you cast that spell! Here, let me help you.\"<br/><br/> As I get closer to the two of them, I see that Daren is now holding one of the goblin's wrists with his right hand, while touching the patient's chest with his left hand. From what I can tell by using my magical sense, Daren seems to be assisting the goblin with his healing spell by helping him stabilize the flow of his magic. Once the spell is cast, Daren lets go of the goblin, and then he takes his hand off the sick man as well.<br/>\"See, this is how it's done!\" Daren says. \"You really shouldn't risk casting these advanced spells unless you have full control over them. You could very easily injure yourself with one of these, if you're not careful.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you for the advice, kind stranger,\" the goblin says in the Common language, with a surprisingly good accent. \"As you could probably tell, I am only a novice in the arts of healing, but I do what I can to help. My name is Kelrim. Pleased to make your acquaintance!\"<br/><br/>He then extends his hand, as Daren shakes it somewhat hesitantly.<br/><br/>\"My name's Daren,\" he says. \"And this here's my friend, Barry. You say your name is Kelrim... I think I heard the guard at the door mention you. He called you an idiot. I don't understand... What are you doing in this place? Why are you helping these people? Did they throw you in the quarantine area, like they did with the others?\"<br/><br/>",

Why would you care if any of these people live or die?\"<br/><br/>\"I could ask you the same thing, human by the name of Daren,\" Kelrim says. \"Why would you care about any of their lives? Aren't you an outsider here? Aren't these humans all strangers to you? So why would you have any reason to want to save any of them? The answer is simple. It's because we are both healers, so it is in our nature to care about other's lives, regardless of their race or species. Is this not the reason why you began learning white magic in the first place? To help make a difference?\"<br/><br/>\"I...\" Daren says, but he can't seem to be able to find his words. \"I don't...\"<br/><br/>\"By the gods!\" Kelrim says, as he moves towards one of the other beds, and he sees the back of Daren's neck accidentally. \"Your neck! It doesn't have the pink spots! What are you doing here if you are not sick? You could be getting the disease any minute now! Don't move, I will cast a protection spell on you immediately!\"<br/><br/> The goblin then extends his hands towards Daren, and a white light envelops him, as I sense the magic flow all around him.<br/>\"And here's one for your friend as well,\" Kelrim says, as he immediately casts the same spell on me. \"Now leave, quickly! This spell won't last for more than an hour, and it can only be cast once every few days for each person. If you don't leave now, I cannot guarantee your safety for long!\"<br/><br/>\"Never mind that!\" Daren says. \"Tell me, what was the protection spell you cast on us just now? It looked very familiar.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Kelrim says, \"this was just a slightly modified version of one of the basic protection spells described in the 'Advanced Theory of Magic' book, written by your sage, Azarius.\"<br/><br/>\"This book again...\" Daren says. \"Barry, you said you read that book. Do you happen to know which spell he is talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"Judging by the way he held his hands and from the manner in which the light enveloped us,\" I say, \"I would wager that it was one of the protections that defend you against magical diseases that directly affect your aura.\"<br/><br/>",

Luckily for me, I am a goblin, so it takes much longer for the disease to take its toll on me, compared to humans. I should still have about two weeks left until my own sickness becomes contagious, so I will try to make the most use of this time to search for a cure.\"<br/>\"If this disease affects the aura,\" Daren says, \"then I should be able to somewhat figure out what needs to be done, by focusing my magical sense on this person while I am in direct contact with him. Let me give it a try.\"<br/><br/>Daren then puts his hand on the sick man's chest once again and he closes his eyes, so he can better visualize the flow of his aura. After just standing like that for about thirty seconds, he finally opens his eyes again, as he gets a very grim expression on his face.<br/><br/>\"Desmond was right...\" Daren says. \"This IS impossible. Unless...\"<br/><br/> Daren then straightens up, with a much more serious look in his eyes, as he takes his hand off the patient on the bed.<br/>\"Unless what?\" Kelrim asks.<br/><br/>\"There is one person who can help, but getting them to assist us might not be so easy,\" Daren says. \"Follow me, and I'll show you what I'm talking about.\"<br/><br/>\"Uhm... okay,\" Kelrim says. \"Lead the way, then.\"<br/><br/>Daren nods, and he begins heading towards the exit, as the goblin and I both follow him. Once we get past the first iron door and the corridor past it, we knock on the iron door leading to the waiting room, letting the guard know that we want out.<br/><br/>\"So, you've given up already, healer?\" Desmond asks Daren, as he opens the door.<br/><br/>\"Not just yet,\" Daren says, and then he leads us back towards our friends, who were still waiting for the king of the underground, near the row of chairs by the wall.<br/><br/>\"A goblin?...\" Illuna asks surprised, when we reach them.<br/><br/>\"Yes, this is Kelrim,\" Daren says. \"A goblin white mage who has been volunteering to treat the sick people in the quarantine area for the past two weeks. He also cast a protection spell on me and Barry that shielded us temporarily from the disease, and he helped me figure out the nature of the illness.\"<br/><br/>\"Daren, working together with a monster?\" Hadrik says. \"Now there's something that I never thought I'd see in this lifetime!\"<br/><br/> \"The healer speaks the truth!\" Breynan says, after inspecting the backs of our necks. \"That temporary spell he spoke of really did manage to protect them from the disease!\"<br/><br/>",

The disease is affecting the aura of the patients, but my magical sense is nowhere near refined enough to be able to understand what caused the sickness and how I can cure it. This is why I had to come back here.\"<br/><br/>He then places himself in front of Illuna, and he gets down to one knee, while bowing his head.<br/><br/>\"Arraka, I need your help,\" Daren says. \"You are the only person I know who has a good enough magical sense to be able to understand how this disease works. I realize how pathetic this is, but I have nobody else to turn to and if I don't do anything, all those people will die. Please... will you help me?\"<br/><br/>\"What the hell?...\" Arraka says, as everyone else is looking at Daren, too shocked to say anything. \"Is this going to be your new thing from now on?

I'll do it. I honestly couldn't care less whether the people in that room live or die, but if this will serve as a good enough motivator for you to actually improve your magical sense beyond just a basic level, then it's going to be time well spent for me. However, I should warn you that I'm not planning to hand you anything on a silver platter. You're the one who's going to be finding the cure to that disease, not me. The only thing I will be doing is giving you vague hints, to get you on the right track. Don't think that I'll go easy on you, just because you're putting your own life on the line. If you die from something as stupid as this, it will only prove to me that you were never ready to face Selkram to begin with. So, tell me healer... after hearing all of this, do you still want my help?\"<br/>\"I do,\" Daren says, still not raising his head.<br/><br/>\"Well, in that case, we have a deal,\" Arraka says. \"Show me those sick patients of yours, and we can start working on them right away, if you want.\"<br/><br/> \"Daren, are you sure about this?\" Kelrim says, as Daren finally raises his head and then stands up from the ground. \"I won't be able to cast the protection spell on you a second time. If you choose to go back in there now, you will catch the disease for good.\"<br/>\"I already accepted that risk when I went in the first time,\" Daren says. \"Illuna, give me the amulet.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" Breynan says. \"Don't go to the quarantine room just yet. The king of the underground should be arriving any minute now, and I think you'll want to hear what he has to say. I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to treat the sick patients after you're done talking with our king.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine,\" Daren says. \"But I hope he hurries up. It's already been a while since we came here.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, this king sure is taking his sweet time to come greet us,\" Hadrik says. \"Hopefully that Albert guy didn't stop to talk with any more of his friends on the way, or we're going to be waiting here for a really long time.\"<br/><br/>\"I don't see any harm in that,\" Leila's father says. \"It gives us a good opportunity to get to know each other better.
