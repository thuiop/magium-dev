"Barry, how long are you planning to stare at that piece of paper?" Daren says. "I told you, there are no conflicts between my protection spells. No matter how many times you check, you can't find something that is not there."

I ignore Daren, and I continue to look at the piece of paper lying on the ground in front of me, while I cross-check the information on it with what I have written in my notebook. The paper has all of Daren's protections written on it, and I was able to find detailed information for most of these spells in my notebook, but I still haven't managed to find the loophole that Eiden used to put Daren to sleep. Hadrik is also sitting on the ground, beside me, looking at the list of spells and throwing wild guesses, but it's clear that he doesn't really know enough about white magic to be able to make any reasonable assessments.

Flower has also tried to look at the paper and at my notebook a few times, but she eventually gave up, saying that it was causing her a headache. Illuna, on the other hand, announced from the very beginning that she wouldn't participate in our brainstorming session, because her knowledge of white mage protection spells was too limited to be able to contribute in any meaningful way.

"Hey," Hadrik tells me. "Doesn't this protection from illusions have a similar chant to that protection from sleep over there? Couldn't that be what's causing the conflict?"

 "No," I say. "There are plenty of spells with similar sounding chants, and that's never caused a conflict as far as I know. It has to be something else. Something obvious I'm missing. I'm going to start again, from the beginning, to see if I didn't skip an important detail somewhere, or something."
"Oh, come on!" Daren says, exasperated. "Hasn't it crossed your mind that maybe Eiden was just pulling your leg back there? Why would he even tell you his weakness? What possible reason could he have to do such a thing?"

 "Aren't you the one who told me your greatest weakness a few minutes after we met?" I ask him, while raising an eyebrow.
"Yeah, but that's different!" Daren says. "Anyone could tell that my shield spell is weak against enchanted weapons after seeing me fight for a while!"

"Wait, you were weak against enchanted weapons?" Hadrik says.

"Ugh..." Daren says.

"No, I'm serious," Hadrik says. "I never noticed. But, why enchanted weapons, specifically? Shouldn't the shield spell automatically defend you from most types of damage? What, are you cursed or something? And besides, why would it even matter? The shield spell is just a spell that they teach to beginner mages. Nobody really uses it in actual combat. It consumes too much energy, and it barely even absorbs enough damage to prevent you from dying, most of the time. The protections against specific types of damage should be much more effective. Not that I really bothered to learn any of those, what with my very durable giant skin and all."

 "White mages have advanced versions of the shield spell," Daren says. "They are a lot more cost effective. And I'm not weak against enchanted weapons, specifically. I'm vulnerable against all types of physical damage. Remember that time when the captain from the ogre fort hit me with a club and threw me into a wall? I've tried many kinds of protection spells against physical damage, but none of them seem to work for me. The only one that kind of works is the shield spell, but it's barely even working against regular weapons, let alone enchanted ones. Enchanting my armor to be as durable as possible was the only way I found to give me some measure of protection against these types of attacks."
"Huh," Hadrik says. "That's odd. Do you suppose it could have anything to do with the spirit from the magical plane that Arraka said you are linked with? Like, maybe the spirit is allergic to earth matter, or something? Barry, what do you think?"

 "I'd say that's certainly a possibility."
"Well," Daren says, "if it ever turns out that I went through all this trouble just because of some spirit's allergies, I know I'm going to get really pissed. I'm probably better off not knowing."

"That armor of yours is probably better than a shield spell in most cases, anyway," I say. "It doesn't eat away at your energy, and you don't need to worry about it conflicting with all of your other-- Hold on... did you just imply earlier that you are actually using a shield spell right now?"

"Well, yeah," Daren says. "It's the only protection spell I've got that offers me some measure of defense against physical attacks. I'd have to be a fool not to use it."

"Then why didn't you write it on this paper?!" I say. "Didn't I tell you to write all the protection spells that you had cast on yourself on our second day of the tournament, without exceptions?"

"I already told you on our first day that I was using a shield spell," Daren says. "And besides, why would it even matter? What does the shield spell have to do with conflicts between protection spells?"

 "It has everything to do with them!" I say. "What the hell, man? Haven't you read any of the books in the 'Advanced Theory of Magic' series, written by Azarius?"
"Hey," Daren says, "some of us didn't spend the entirety of our lives nerding it up in libraries. Everything that I've learned about magic, I've learned from my teachers."

"Well, in that case, your teachers are all a bunch of idiots!" I say.

"You take that back!" Daren says. "My white magic teacher was an ex-sage. Do you have any idea how hard it is to become a sage when you only specialize in white magic, without any sort of combat training?"

"Not hard enough, apparently," I tell him.

"Gods be damned!" Daren says. "Do you have no respect at all for the work it takes to--"

"What's going on, here?" Kate asks us, as her and Leila are slowly approaching us, with some shopping bags in their hands. "What are you two arguing about again?"

"Barry is refusing to acknowledge the effort that is required to--" Daren starts to say, but I interrupt him.

"Never mind, that!" I say. "Daren, can you tell me which kind of shield spell you are using, exactly? Is it the newer one that gives an advantage against physical attacks?"

 "I'd be more inclined to think that he linked himself to the spirit incorrectly."
"Yeah," Daren says. "Easy for you to say. You're not a mage. And the only way you've cast magic so far was through that trinket of yours. Even after hearing Arraka's explanation, I still don't have any idea how to see this connection between me and my spirit. I've tried every way I could think of to analyze my magical aura for traces of a link to the magical plane, but I don't even know what to look for."

 "I don't think it's related. He probably just got born this way."
"Yeah," Daren says. "I'm all for pinning the blame on some vague non-corporeal entity that I've never met before, but realistically speaking, Barry is probably right. I've already accustomed myself long ago to the idea that I won't ever be able to cast decent protection against physical damage, so it doesn't really bother me as much as it used to, anymore."

 "What?..." Daren says. "Oh... Yeah, yeah, that's the one..."
"What's Barry doing?" Kate asks the others, when she sees me flipping my notebook's pages like crazy.

"He says he found out how Eiden managed to put Daren to sleep, despite his protections," Hadrik says. "Apparently, it's because of protection overload, and now he's trying to find the two protection spells that are conflicting with each other."

"Protection overload?" Kate says. "That does sound like something Daren would do..."

"I found it!" I say. "The sleep protection from Daren's shield spell has an almost identical aura flow to one of his individual sleep protection spells. Look at these two diagrams!"

I then show them my notebook, flipping the pages between the two diagrams, so they can see the resemblance.

"Are you sure that's not just because you suck at drawing?" Daren says. "If your ugly handwriting is anything to go by, I'm not sure how much I would trust your ability to accurately copy a diagram from a book."

I frown at Daren.

"Well, why don't we have a test, then?" I say. "Does anyone here know any sleep spells?"

 "I know a sleep spell," Illuna says. "It takes a while to cast, and I need to touch him while I do it, but it should be more than enough for what we need."
"Perfect!" I say. "Here are the diagrams. You need to make sure to time your sleep spell just right, and to aim it at the exact point where the two aura flows intersect."

"Yes, I know how it works," Illuna says, as she takes one quick look at the diagrams, and then she heads towards Daren.

"Oh, this should be good," Daren says.

Once Illuna reaches Daren, she places the palm of her hand on his right arm, and she closes her eyes, trying to visualize the flows of the auras.

"See?" Daren says, after about five seconds of waiting for Illuna to cast her spell. "I told you that you're wasting your time by--"

Daren does not get to finish what he was saying, because his eyes suddenly roll to the back of his head, and he falls to the ground, like a log.

 "That settles it," Illuna says. "The oaf was using conflicting protection spells."
"Well, what do you know!" Hadrik says. "Barry was right. I think someone should wake Daren up, though. That does not look like a comfortable position to be sleeping in."

"Allow me," Illuna says.

She then conjures a bucket's worth of water above Daren's head, which she immediately drops on his face.

"What the--" Daren says, as he quickly gets up from the ground, and then he coughs some water out of his lungs. "How did I end up on the ground?"

"Take a wild guess," Kate says.

"No..." Daren says. "It can't be..."

"Well, Daren," I say. "I guess this means that you will now officially be losing your last bit of protection against physical damage. Welcome to the club!"

 "No!" Daren says. "I'm not letting go of the shield! I've worked too hard to learn it! I'd rather give up that other protection spell than stop using the shield."
"Suit yourself," I say. "The sleep protection from your shield is a little weaker than the individual one, though."

"I don't care!" Daren says.

"Well, as long as you make sure that there are no more conflicts..." I say.

I pause for a few seconds.

"So, I guess that now I am the only one left without proper protection against sleep spells, then..." I say.

 "Well, technically, I don't have any magical protection against them, either," Hadrik says. "Giants are naturally immune to sleep spells."
"Lessathi are also immune to sleep spells," Kate says.

"They are?" I say. "What about half-lessathi?"

"No idea," Kate says. "Maybe you are only half immune."

"Half immune?" I say. "How would that even work? Hey, Illuna, could you try putting me to sleep too, so we can see what happens?"

Illuna sighs, and she approaches me, touching my arm with her right hand, just like she did with Daren. A few seconds later, I feel a strong dizziness, and everything around me is starting to get blurry.

 "Damn it!" I say, as I feel the world spinning around me. "I may as well be put to sleep for all the difference this would make in a fight. I can't even tell up from down anymore. What's happening right now? Am I still standing up?"
"Nah," Hadrik says. "You're sitting with your arse on the ground, while grabbing your head with both your hands."

All of a sudden, I feel my mind become clear again, and as I raise my head, I see Illuna standing in front of me, with her hand on my forehead.

"What did you do?" I ask her.

"I cast a spell to cure your dizziness," Illuna says, as she takes her hand off my forehead. "I also have a 'protection from dizziness' spell that I can cast on you, if you want. Given your partial immunity to sleep spells, protection from dizziness should help you both against sleep spells and against spells that attempt to disorient you. There is also a downside, however. While you have this spell cast on yourself, you will be a lot more vulnerable to suggestion magic, since the clarity of your thoughts will make it easier for someone to magically insert ideas into your brain. If I cast the protection spell on you now, it should last you for a few weeks, but there would be no problem in recasting it every day or so, to be safe."

 "Alright then. Go ahead and cast the spell!"
Illuna nods, and she begins to say an incantation, while she has both her palms pointed towards me. Once she's done chanting, a white light surrounds me for a few seconds, which then disappears almost as quickly as it appeared.

"It's done," Illuna says.

"Great," I say, as I get up from the ground. "Of course, it would have been even greater if our team's white mage could actually cast any sort of protection spells on anyone but himself. You know, kind of like what every other white mage in existence is capable of doing?"

"Give me a break!" Daren says. "I already told you. Learning the versions of the spells that can only be cast on myself was easier. I was never planning to work in a team, during my travels, so it seemed like a waste of time to learn the more advanced versions of the spells, if I'd never get the chance to use them. The barrier that I can cast with my shield has always been more than enough to protect civilians from harm during monster attacks. And it's not like I can just make a few adjustments and change the spells I already know so they can be cast on other people. I'd have to learn entirely different spells for this to work, and we've got no time for that. Just let it go, already."

"Hey, I'm just saying," I say, "If you had actually decided to specialize in only one type of magic like everyone else instead of going for both enchantment and white magic, this wouldn't have been a problem."

 "Drop it," Daren says.
"Fine, fine," I say. "I guess we're all done here, then? Should we get moving?"

"Hold on," Kate says. "Leila still needs to get her new backpack enchanted. We can't just walk with these bags in our hands, all the way to the palace."

"Alright," Daren says. "Give me the backpack. I'll enchant it right away."

As soon as Daren is done with the backpack and Leila puts all of her clothes inside it, we all leave the market area, and we make our way towards the castle of Thilias once more. As we walk, we begin to tell Kate and Leila about everything that happened with Eiden while they were shopping.

 "Eiden said he'd give you the power to stop the calamity threatening to destroy the cities?..." Daren says. "That doesn't make any sense. Didn't he tell us that he would be destroying the cities himself?"
"That's not what he said," I say. "His exact words were that the calamity would happen as a direct result of his own actions."

"Isn't that kind of the same thing, though?" Hadrik says.

"Not really," I say. "The way he phrased it, it didn't seem like the destruction of the cities would be his main purpose. More like a side effect of whatever he's planning to do. Let's say, for example, that Eiden knows for a fact that he will be forced to fight Tyrath personally before the end of this tournament. If the dragon is to be believed, then such a fight would completely raze the continent, which would most likely erase all of Varathia's cities from the map."

"Damn," Daren says. "You might be right. With the dragon declaring war against all of the cities, and Eiden announcing his return as the 'Creator', I wouldn't be too surprised if the two leaders of the armies ended up clashing before the end of the tournament."

 "That's not all," I say. "Eiden specifically told us that this calamity would only happen 'shortly' before the end of the tournament. This means that he is expecting the tournament to play a part in triggering this calamity, somehow."
"Maybe the dragon will be waiting for most of the tournament participants to die out, before he begins his attack?" Hadrik says.

"That's definitely possible," I say. "I'm guessing that the cities of Varathia already have their own defenses against Tyrath's armies, and he's also got the animals to worry about. It would be a pretty bad idea for him to unleash his armies now, when there are mages wandering around the continent, capable of slaughtering hundreds of monsters without much effort."

I sigh, before I continue.

"I don't know why I'm getting the feeling that we're going to have to deal with that dragon in one way or another, if we want there to be any organizers left alive to hand us the prize at the end of the tournament."

"Ooh," Daren says. "And are you going to defeat the dragon by yourself too, just like you said you'd save all the cities? You've got a busy schedule ahead of you, I'll tell you that!"

 "Shut up," I say. "I know I can't do it all by myself. I only said that on the spur of the moment, because Eiden was pissing me off with his defeatist attitude. Luckily, I've got a friend who's a well-known legendary mage that might be able to lend me a hand, if things get too rough. He can't cast a proper shield spell to save his life, and he sucks at magical theory, but at least he's decent enough with a sword and shield."

"In either case," Kate says, "we shouldn't rely too much on Eiden's promise to give Barry powers if he succeeds in his task. The terms of their agreement are much too vague, and Eiden could very well change his mind at any moment."

"I agree," Daren says. "However, given the vague information we have about this so-called calamity, the only way we can be certain that it doesn't happen is by taking care of both Eiden and the dragon, and that is... definitely not going to be an easy task."

"Don't worry," I say. "I know what kind of tricks Eiden's using, now. I'm sure I'll have them all figured out in no time. I haven't been studying magic all my life for nothing!"

 "Hah!" Arraka says. "Now there's something I would love to see: Eiden getting beaten by his own tricks."
"Let's not be too hasty," Daren says. "Barry only figured out two of his tricks so far. I'm guessing Eiden would know hundreds of them after his long life as a stillwater. Anyway, I'd say we've talked enough about Eiden. Let's pick up our pace. We've spent quite a bit of time in that marketplace, so we'd better hurry up if we don't want to leave the king waiting."

It takes us about another hour to finally reach the front gate of the king's palace. The king's servant was waiting for us at the entrance, and as soon as we get within hearing range of him, he announces that Golmyck is currently waiting for us inside. As we make our way into the throne room, we see that the gnome is sitting on the floor, on all fours, with a wrench in his hand, trying to adjust the height of his throne.

 "Fine, I'll do it all by myself, then."
"Come on, don't be like that!" Daren says. "You know I was only joking. Still, you might want to reevaluate your goals a bit, here. Because I'm pretty sure that messing around in the cities is going to put you behind the other participants of the tournament, who are focusing only on the objectives."

"I'll find a way to make it work," I say.

"Of course you will," Daren says, in a sarcastic tone.

"In either case," Kate says, "we shouldn't rely too much on Eiden's promise to give Barry powers if he succeeds in his task. The terms of their agreement are much too vague, and Eiden could very well change his mind at any moment."

"I agree," Daren says. "However, given the vague information we have about this so-called calamity, the only way we can be certain that it doesn't happen is by taking care of both Eiden and the dragon, and that is... definitely not going to be an easy task."

"Don't worry," I say. "I know what kind of tricks Eiden's using, now. I'm sure I'll have them all figured out in no time. I haven't been studying magic all my life for nothing!"

 "Hey, you're the hero, not me. Isn't saving cities supposed to be your job?"
"Sure," Daren says. "But the whole idea I had when I came here was to focus on the actual tournament, so I could do a better job as a hero once I've won the Magium, remember? Still, I get what you're saying. The situation in these lands is much worse than I thought it would be, and from what I understand, Thilias should be one of the better cities in Varathia. Something definitely needs to be done."

 "Just a minute," Golmyck says, as he tightens one last bolt at the base of his throne.
He then gets up from the ground, and he gives us each one quick look.

"I see that the young lessathi girl has decided to join your group," Golmyck says, and then he turns to Leila. "I'm very sorry about your father. He was a respectable inventor, and he did not deserve the fate that he got. Unfortunately, there was no way for me to intervene in his trial, even if I suspected the evidence to be forged. For what it's worth, I made sure to cancel his pursuit as soon as he escaped the city, so he at least won't need to watch his back, on his way to Ollendor."

"...Thank you," Leila writes, not knowing exactly what else to say.

"You are here for the documents, yes?" Golmyck says, now turning to us. "Follow me to my private room. I will stamp the papers for you there."

 He goes to pull the lever behind the throne, and the path towards his secret subterranean room opens up once more, just like the last time when we've visited the castle.
"Barry, as usual, the throne room is in your care until I return," Golmyck says.

"Yes, your highness," the king's servant says.

"Barry?" Leila writes, looking very confused.

"Yeah, that's what the king's servant is named," Hadrik says, while we go down the stairs towards the secret room. "Isn't that hilarious? We've been joking about it for hours after the last time we came here."

"I see..." Leila writes.

When we reach the subterranean chamber, the king lays out a few papers on his desk, and he begins to stamp them, one by one.

#if(v_b2_ch2_deal == 3) {
 I suddenly remember the deal I made with the lessathi that came to visit me in my holding cell, below the arena. I still have that guy's device with me, in my pocket. I'm pretty sure that the device was supposed to tamper with this room's soundproofing, but I can't tell if it's working or not. Well, the deal was for me to simply enter this room, while carrying the device, so I honestly couldn't care less if it actually works or not. Either way, the gnome doesn't seem to have noticed it.
"So, uh..." Daren says, while looking towards Golmyck. "I think there's something we should let you know about. We ran into Eiden on our way to the castle, and he told us that there will be a calamity shortly before the end of this tournament that will destroy all the cities in Varathia. A calamity that will be triggered by his actions. We are suspecting that he might get into a fight with the dragon Tyrath, which is what will cause all the damage."

"I see..." Golmyck says, as he takes a short pause from stamping the documents, to think about what Daren said. "Well, if this calamity is indeed of the magnitude that you describe, then it would serve no purpose to try fortifying our defenses. The only way we could survive such a thing is to make sure it doesn't happen at all. Did Eiden tell you that this calamity would involve the dragon?"

"No," Daren says. "But he implied that destroying the cities is not his actual purpose, even though their eradication would happen due to his actions. A fight between him and the dragon is the only thing we could think of that would make sense, given these circumstances."

 "Hmm..." Golmyck says, as he rubs his chin. "There is something that I don't fully understand, here. Perhaps you could clarify it for me. What exactly is your affiliation with Eiden? He has personally intervened to save your lives before, and I see that you know him well enough to have private discussions with him, but I can't tell in what way you are connected to him. Have any of you been acquainted with him from before you came to Varathia?"
"No," Daren says. "We all met him here for the first time."

"Then why is he so fixated on you, and not on any of the other participants?" Golmyck says. "Surely you cannot be the only unique group that has joined this tournament?"

He then stamps two more documents, and he hands them over to us, so we can each take a look at them.

"There you go," the king says. "These papers should be enough to absolve you of your crimes, no matter where you go in Varathia. Now, if there's nothing else you need from me, I will be resuming my work on the lessathi device that was supposed to send you the instructions related to the tournament's objectives, telepathically. I've been trying to get it fixed for more than a week, but I still can't figure out what's wrong with it, so you can imagine how frustrating this has been for me."

The king then wishes us all safe travels, and we make our way back up to the throne room, where the king's servant was waiting for us. 

After he leads us outside, it takes us about an hour and a half to reach the mansion, where Enrique was currently still busy preparing our feast. On our way here, I made sure to dispose of the device that the lessathi from the arena gave me, since he never actually told me what to do with it after exiting the throne room, and I didn't want to risk carrying it with me any longer than I needed to, in case they had some way of tracking it remotely. I'm sure they'll be able to find and retrieve it without my help.

 Given that we still needed to wait quite a bit until the cooking was done, Hadrik pulled a deck of cards out of his backpack, and we all sat ourselves down at one of the picnic tables in the mansion's yard, to play a game that Hadrik learned during his time spent in dwarven taverns. Apparently, one of the original rules of the game was that a player needed to take a sip of dwarven ale every time they lost a hand, but we decided to scrap this rule, because we didn't want to get drunk before the feast even began.
The game involved a lot of bluffing, so it was no surprise that Leila was the one who came out on top, given that she could read auras, to tell if someone was lying. Since I was the one she could get a read on the easiest because of my 'spiky' aura, I eventually got tired of losing every single match, and I decided to take a break to read my notebook some more, in the hopes of finding more loopholes that Eiden might be using.

"Hey, Daren," I say, after reading through the notebook for some time. "Remember that one time when Eiden paralyzed every one of you? Right before he teleported us in front of Thilias?"

"What?..." Daren says, as he's trying to focus on his cards while listening to me. "Oh, yeah, I remember. What about it?"

"How many spells do you have that protect you against paralysis?" I say. 

"Just one," Daren says. "And the shield does not protect against paralysis, so it's not protection overload!"

 "Okay, okay," I say. "Is anyone else using protection against paralysis?"
"Yes," Kate says. "I use the spell described in the latest 'Advanced Theory of Magic' book by Azarius."

"Alright," I say. "And you, Daren? Which protection are you using?"

Apparently, one of the original rules of the game was that a player needed to take a sip of dwarven ale every time they lost a hand, but we decided to scrap this rule, because we didn't want to get drunk before the feast even began.
The game involved a lot of bluffing, so it was no surprise that Leila was the one who came out on top, given that she could read auras, to tell if someone was lying. Since I was the one she could get a read on the easiest because of my 'spiky' aura, I eventually got tired of losing every single match, and I decided to take a break to read my notebook some more, in the hopes of finding more loopholes that Eiden might be using.

"Hey, Daren," I say, after reading through the notebook for some time. "Remember that one time when Eiden paralyzed every one of you? Right before he teleported us in front of Thilias?"

"What?..." Daren says, as he's trying to focus on his cards while listening to me. "Oh, yeah, I remember. What about it?"

"How many spells do you have that protect you against paralysis?" I say. 

"Just one," Daren says. "And the shield does not protect against paralysis, so it's not protection overload!"

 "Okay, okay," I say. "Is anyone else using protection against paralysis?"
"Yes," Kate says. "I use the spell described in the latest 'Advanced Theory of Magic' book by Azarius."

"Alright," I say. "And you, Daren? Which protection are you using?"

"The golden one," Daren says. "The one that makes a spinning effect with sparkles when you cast it."

 "Very well, then," Golmyck says. "Let me just finish stamping these documents, and you'll be free to go."
He then stamps two more documents, and he hands them over to us, so we can each take a look at them.

"There you go," the king says. "These papers should be enough to absolve you of your crimes, no matter where you go in Varathia. Now, if there's nothing else you need from me, I will be resuming my work on the lessathi device that was supposed to send you the instructions related to the tournament's objectives, telepathically. I've been trying to get it fixed for more than a week, but I still can't figure out what's wrong with it, so you can imagine how frustrating this has been for me."

The king then wishes us all safe travels, and we make our way back up to the throne room, where the king's servant was waiting for us. 

After he leads us outside, it takes us about an hour and a half to reach the mansion, where Rose was currently still busy preparing our feast.

 "Uh..." I say. "Okay... So, you mean the advanced version from the standard white mage spellbook. And Hadrik, I assume that you are relying on your partial resistance that comes from being a giant in order to defend yourself from such spells?"
"Yeah," Hadrik says. "But I got paralyzed completely, just like Kate and Daren, despite my resistance."

"Uh-huh," I say. "Well, do you guys know what these three defenses of yours have in common?"

"What?" Daren says.

"Absolutely nothing," I say, as I close my notebook. "Which means that Eiden was not using a loophole, this time around. In fact, I don't think he was using paralysis at all. He must have been using a completely different type of spell, which has the same effect. Remember that time when Kate's friend left us all unconscious on the ground? She didn't use a sleep spell to do it. She used electricity. I'm suspecting that Eiden used a similar method to temporarily paralyze you. Didn't you all feel a shock right before you fell to the ground? I'm pretty sure you must have also felt a few other electric shocks afterwards, which were meant to keep you paralyzed for a longer period of time."

"Come to think of it, yeah!" Daren says. "I did feel some electric shocks. But they didn't feel much different from the feeling you get from a normal paralysis, so I didn't really notice the difference at the time. But does this mean that Eiden can use electricity as an element, like Kate's friend?"

 "I doubt it," I say. "The spell that he used seemed to have certain rules and limitations, which would not have been the case if he could have used electricity freely, as an element. The electric spell that he used to paralyze you felt extremely similar to a spell that I had access to, back when I had my stat device powered up, so it's likely the same one. I don't remember every single detail about it, but it was one of those spells that you could only cast once a day, and I know for sure that one major drawback of the spell was the fact that the area of effect was extremely small. I mean, you could pretty much just roll over to the side, and the following electrical currents would not target you anymore. The only reason why it worked against you was because you three happened to be standing very close together, and because you didn't know what kind of spell you were up against. If you knew how it worked, then you could have just gotten out of the way at the exact moment before a new electrical current hit you, since the effect of the paralysis wears off a bit, right before each new shock."
"Yeah, I very much doubt that I could have done that," Daren says, "since I was trying to break free of the spell's effect the whole time, and it didn't work."

 "That's because the spell shocks you at faster intervals if it sees that you're trying to break free!" I say. "It doesn't work that way. You need to be relaxed, and to only try to escape at the very last second. Of course, you can't know how often it will shock you until you let yourself get shocked a few times, while counting the number of seconds for each interval. The intervals will not always be of the same length, but there will usually be a pattern that you can figure out. Once you're sure that you got the count right, you wait for the last moment, and only then you try to escape. Obviously, the easier way around this would be to use protection against electricity, but with the amount of energy it takes to keep that protection up and running, you'd have to be insane to use it at all times, on the off-chance that you'll get attacked by an electrical spell other than the standard ones."
"Uh," Hadrik says, "not that I want to interrupt you or anything, but we should really hurry up if we want to finish the game before Enrique is done with the feast preparations. We likely only have about twenty minutes left until the food is done, and everyone except Leila still has at least five cards left in their hands."

 "Now, then..." Golmyck says, as he gets a serious look in his eyes. "Leaving Eiden and the calamity aside, I believe that there was a more pressing issue that we agreed we'd discuss once you'd be free from your imprisonment. Am I correct in assuming that you are all still on board with our plans concerning the lessathi?"
"Of course..." I say, as I take a quick glance towards the others, to make sure that none of them changed their minds in the meantime.

"What about your new friend?" Golmyck says. "Will she be joining you as well?"

"We haven't told her anything," Kate says, "since you said we shouldn't talk about any of this outside your room, but I think that she may want to come with us as well, given the circumstances."

"Ah, yes," Golmyck says. "Especially since some of the lessathi you are about to fight are the ones who imprisoned her, and also the ones who conspired with her landlord to sell her father into slavery..."

"Wait, what are you talking about?" Leila writes. "Why are you fighting the lessathi?"

"We've been told," Kate says, "that there is a select group of lessathi who reside in this city, and who have been tasked by the other kings of Varathia to keep the gnome king in check and to make sure that he does not overstep his boundaries. We intend to rid the king of this problem."

 "You want to kill all the lessathi in this city?" Leila writes, shocked. "You can't! If you kill any one of them, the others will find out, and they will send back word to their main headquarters. You will become one of their main targets!"
"I would be surprised if I weren't already one of the lessathi's main targets," Kate says. "They should know very well who I am."

"Actually, the lessathi will not have the time to contact their main headquarters," Golmyck says, as we all turn towards him. "When I accepted your help, it was because I already had an idea of how you could deal with this problem in a timely manner, without it affecting your tournament schedule. There would have been no use in requesting your aid if there wasn't a quick way to deal with all of the lessathi at the same time, before they get the chance to alert their allies."

"What do you mean?" Hadrik says.

 "The lessathi will be holding a meeting in about two hours from now," Golmyck says, "in a subterranean chamber situated not far from this castle. The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the political implications of the earl of Ollendor's murder, and how it will affect them and the city of Thilias in the coming weeks. At first, this gathering was supposed to be held after your trial and execution. However, as I suspected, Eiden's intervention forced them to postpone it until after the end of the arena fights. Since you all managed to survive, I am quite certain that they will have a lot to discuss, especially regarding the reaction that Ollendor will be having to this unexpected turn of events. The meeting is mandatory for all the four lessathi who reside in this city, so you will have the opportunity to attack them all at once, without fearing that any of them will find out what happened to their comrades, and go into hiding."

 "But how will we get there without being noticed?" Daren asks.
"This room that we are now standing in is connected to a large network of underground tunnels," Golmyck says. "One of these tunnels will lead you exactly where you need to go. I know this, because I've had one of my spies follow Barry through one of the underground corridors, and directly to the lessathi headquarters a few weeks ago. Luckily, none of them know that this room of mine also has a secret entrance to the tunnels, so they haven't bothered to post any guards at this particular entrance."

"Hold on, hold on," Hadrik says. "When you say Barry, you're talking about your servant, right?"

"Oh, that's right, I meant my servant!" Golmyck says. "I keep forgetting that I need to specify."

"Well, if it's your servant, then couldn't you have just asked him for the information directly?" Hadrik says. "Why would you go through the trouble of having him followed?"

 "Oh," Golmyck says, smiling. "It's because my servant is a traitor. He's been working with the lessathi for years. That's why I never let him inside my private room."
"A traitor?" Hadrik asks, shocked. "What the hell, man? If you've known that he's a traitor for so long, then why do you still keep him around?"

"It's because Barry has never been very smart," Golmyck says. "He is extremely easy to read, and he also never manages to realize when he's being followed. I'd much rather have him as a plant, than someone who would be smart enough to actually fool me. And this way, I get to find out useful information about the lessathi, such as the exact hour and location of their meeting today. It's very convenient. All I need to do is let slip some seemingly sensitive, but ultimately useless information to him every once in a while, to avoid suspicion, and I get to have my own spy in the lessathi organization, with minimal effort on my part."

 So the king's servant was a traitor... Now I understand why that lessathi who I met in the prison knew about my stat device. It's because I showed it to the servant on my way to the arena. Damn it, I should have been more careful.
"Does that mean that you will also have your servant killed once we're done with our job?" Daren asks.

"Oh, goodness, no!" Golmyck says. "Barry is harmless. There would be no reason to kill him. He does not know any lessathi other than the ones in this city, so as soon as those four are dealt with, he will revert to being just my servant, without any of the spying shenanigans."

"Do you have some sort of map of the underground tunnels that could help us reach our destination?" Kate asks.

"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do!" Golmyck says, as he takes a folded parchment from his pocket and then begins to unfold it.

He lays out the map on the workbench, so we can all see it clearly, and then he explains to us in detail which of the tunnels we'll need to take, and where the lessathi headquarters is located on the map.

 "Arraka, can you--" Illuna starts to say, but she gets interrupted.
"Yeah, yeah, I've got it," Arraka says. "Hold on a sec."

She then conjures a detailed hologram of the underground tunnels, although the map seems to be a little different from how she usually draws it. The lines that represent the edges of the corridors are no longer all drawn in the same color. Some of them are blue, while others are green.

"Is there any reason why you decided to use a different color for some of the corridors?" I say.

"Yeah, the green tunnels are the ones that I can't actually detect with my magical sense," Arraka says. "I only put them there because they're on the map. They probably have walls and ceilings made of seredium, which block my magical sense. I have no idea if there are people walking through them, or if they can even be accessed at all.

As Golmyck goes to work on his device, Hadrik puts down his backpack, and he reaches within it, to pull out a deck of playing cards.

"So..." Hadrik says. "Anyone up for a game of cards?"

We spend the next hour or so playing a card game that Hadrik learned from dwarven taverns. Apparently, one of the original rules of the game was that a player needed to take a sip of dwarven ale every time they lost a hand, but we had to scrap this rule for obvious reasons.

A few seconds after she's done talking, three more blue corridors appear on the hologram that is floating in front of her amulet.

"Hey, look," I say, "one of those corridors seems to link one of the tunnels we'll be taking with one of the seredium tunnels. And that tunnel also leads towards the lessathi headquarters."

"Yeah, but I can't guarantee that the seredium tunnel is currently functional," Arraka says. "Like I said, I only put it there because it was on the map."

He must have been using a completely different type of spell, which has the same effect. Remember that time when Kate's friend left us all unconscious on the ground? She didn't use a sleep spell to do it. She used electricity. I'm suspecting that Eiden used a similar method to temporarily paralyze you. Didn't you all feel a shock right before you fell to the ground? I'm pretty sure you must have also felt a few other electric shocks afterwards, which were meant to keep you paralyzed for a longer period of time."

 "Come to think of it, yeah!" Daren says. "I did feel some electric shocks. But they didn't feel much different from the feeling you get from a normal paralysis, so I didn't really notice the difference at the time. But does this mean that Eiden can use electricity as an element, like Kate's friend?"
"I doubt it," I say. "The spell that he used seemed to have certain rules and limitations, which would not have been the case if he could have used electricity freely, as an element. The electric spell that he used to paralyze you felt extremely similar to a spell that I had access to, back when I had my stat device powered up, so it's likely the same one. I don't remember every single detail about it, but it was one of those spells that you could only cast once a day, and I know for sure that one major drawback of the spell was the fact that the area of effect was extremely small. I mean, you could pretty much just roll over to the side, and the following electrical currents would not target you anymore. The only reason why it worked against you was because you three happened to be standing very close together, and because you didn't know what kind of spell you were up against. If you knew how it worked, then you could have just gotten out of the way at the exact moment before a new electrical current hit you, since the effect of the paralysis wears off a bit, right before each new shock."

 "Yeah, I very much doubt that I could have done that," Daren says, "since I was trying to break free of the spell's effect the whole time, and it didn't work."
"That's because the spell shocks you at faster intervals if it sees that you're trying to break free!" I say. "It doesn't work that way. You need to be relaxed, and to only try to escape at the very last second. Of course, you can't know how often it will shock you until you let yourself get shocked a few times, while counting the number of seconds for each interval. The intervals will not always be of the same length, but there will usually be a pattern that you can figure out. Once you're sure that you got the count right, you wait for the last moment, and only then you try to escape. Obviously, the easier way around this would be to use protection against electricity, but with the amount of energy it takes to keep that protection up and running, you'd have to be insane to use it at all times, on the off-chance that you'll get attacked by an electrical spell other than the standard ones."

 "Uh," Hadrik says, "not that I want to interrupt you or anything, but we should really hurry up if we want to finish the game before we leave. We've only got about half an hour left before the lessathi meeting, and everyone except Leila still has at least six cards left in their hands."
Once Hadrik and the others finish their game, we leave our backpacks in the care of king Golmyck, and we all get ready to descend into the tunnels below.

"Be careful," Golmyck says, before we leave. "The lessathi may not be mages, but their highly advanced magical devices make them into as big a threat as some of the most skilled participants that have joined this tournament. I would have given you more information about them, but unfortunately the only thing I know is that the one wielding two scythes is using electric attacks. The functions of the others' devices are still unknown to me."

"Well," I say, "at least we know who we'll be targeting first."

The king opens a trapdoor which leads to the underground corridors, and an extension ladder drops down, allowing us to reach the floor of the tunnel safely. We climb down one by one, and once we all reach the lower level, Golmyck wishes us luck, and he pulls the ladder back up, closing the trapdoor with a loud thump. Looking up, I can barely tell that there had been an open trapdoor on the ceiling above us, only seconds ago. The texture of the secret door blends perfectly with the rocky surface of the ceiling and walls, making it completely hidden, unless you know exactly where to look for it.

 We travel through the corridors for a few minutes, making sure to carefully follow the directions that the king gave us, while periodically asking Arraka if she doesn't sense any guards on our way to the lessathi headquarters.
"Look, the lessathi are starting their meeting!" Flower says, as she points towards several green dots that are now moving inside the lessathi headquarters from Arraka's hologram.

"A little earlier than they were supposed to, but not by much," Daren says, as he also looks towards the hologram in front of Flower. "We should still make it there before they finish. It won't be long until we reach the last corridor, and then we should be able to see the entrance to their lair. I'm still feeling a little uneasy about all of these empty tunnels, though. I can't help but feel that we're walking into a trap of some kind."

"Don't be so pessimistic, Daren," Hadrik says. "The king said that the lessathi don't know about his hidden trapdoor, so it's normal that they wouldn't have anyone in charge of guarding these areas. Maybe they'll have some guards posted in front of their meeting hall, and that will put your worries to rest."

"Yeah," Arraka says. "There's probably a lever or something hidden inside that wall that would open the secret door."

"And you're sure that this tunnel leads directly to that tunnel over there that goes to the headquarters?" Daren says.

"I already told you," Arraka says, "I don't know what this tunnel leads to. It may be another tunnel, or it may be a dead end as far as I know. Not to mention that even if it leads to a tunnel, there's no guarantee that it won't be filled with guards, since I can't sense anything inside it."

 "Daren, why are you so interested in that tunnel, all of a sudden?" Hadrik says. "Why can't we just go on the path that we were already following?"

As we make our way further into the tunnel, I begin to ask myself if not choosing to enter that secret corridor really was the best decision. This tunnel is still as empty as ever, and I cannot deny that I'm also starting to get a bit of an eerie feeling as we get closer to our destination. I do not have the time to ask myself these questions much longer, because a few seconds later, the whole area around us is covered in a huge explosion, which sends the ceiling crashing down upon us and kills me in an instant.

As we make our way further into the tunnel, I can't seem to get Daren's words out of my head. What if he was right? What if we really are walking into a trap, and the lessathi are onto us? Maybe we should go back and try to find another way towards their headquarters while we still have the chance.

"That part of the corridor is rigged to explode if we go any further," I say.

"Did you see a premonition of this happening?" Kate asks.

"Yes," I say. "We can't go that way. We need to go back."

"But why would there be a trap on this corridor?" Hadrik asks. "Isn't this the path that the gnome's servant usually takes to reach their headquarters? Why would they risk it?"

 "They're probably onto us," Daren says. "The king already told us that the lessathi have listening devices inside the throne room, which means that they should be aware that we've visited Golmyck's secret room twice so far. Even if they don't know about the hidden trapdoor, they still have good reason to be cautious."
"Yeah, but to risk blowing up this whole corridor based on a simple hunch..." Hadrik says. "I don't know, I'm finding it a bit hard to believe. Barry, are you sure that your thingamajig isn't malfunctioning somehow? I mean, you don't have any guarantee that those premonitions will always come true, do you?"

"Don't mind if I do!" Hadrik says, and he picks up a rock from the ground, which he then throws further down the corridor.

As soon as the rock hits the ground, a big explosion covers the area around it, sending the whole ceiling above it crashing down, and blocking our path.

"Okay," Hadrik says. "You convinced me, Barry. Let's go back."

"You do realize that there's no way in hell the lessathi didn't hear that explosion from earlier, right?" Daren says.

"Even if they've heard it, they're not reacting to it," I say. "Look at the map. The four lessathi haven't moved from their original spots. Either they can't hear any noise from inside there, or they think we're dead. What we need now, is to figure out a way to get around this cave-in. Arraka, you wouldn't happen to detect any other tunnels around here that aren't marked on the king's map, would you?"

 "Huh?" Arraka asks. "Oh, I do, actually... Hold on, let me add them to the hologram."
A few seconds after she's done talking, three more blue corridors appear on the hologram that is floating in front of her amulet.

"Hey, look," I say, "one of those corridors seems to link the tunnel we're currently in with one of the seredium tunnels. And that tunnel also leads towards the lessathi headquarters."

"Yeah, but I can't guarantee that the seredium tunnel is currently functional," Arraka says. "Like I said before, I only put it there because it was on the gnome's map. I can't sense anything inside it. It may as well be filled with guards, for all I know."

"Well, it's better than nothing," I say. "Which wall leads to the secret tunnel? That one?"

I then point towards a specific area on the wall to our right, while waiting for Arraka's answer.

"Uh-huh," Arraka says.

"Alright," Hadrik says. "Well, in that case, I'll go open the path for us."

 "Yes," Daren says, as Hadrik heads towards the wall that leads to the secret tunnel. "As long as we know which wall leads to the tunnel, finding the secret lever that opens it up shouldn't be that--"
Before Daren gets to finish his sentence, Hadrik reaches the wall, and he punches right through it, making it crumble into pieces. 

"Seriously..." Daren says, as he smacks his forehead with the palm of his hand. "Do you have to do this every single time?"

"Relax!" Hadrik says. "The lessathi are too far away to hear a mere few rocks crumbling down, and if there really are guards on the other side, it's not like we'd have any way to sneak past them. It's a direct path to the lessathi headquarters from here. No way around."

We travel through the secret tunnel without encountering any form of resistance. When we reach the end of it, Hadrik takes a quick glance towards the rest of us, and then he punches through the wall, clearing our way to the seredium corridor. As we look around us, we see that this tunnel is just as empty as the other ones.

"Arraka," Illuna says, "do you sense any guards?"

"Nope," Arraka says. "It's empty. No magical traps either. Don't know about regular traps, though."

"Well, regular traps tend to get triggered by stepping on the ground," Hadrik says, "so I'll just make sure to throw rocks ahead of us on a regular basis, to see if anything explodes. I'm the one with the tough giant skin here, so I'll go in front. If anything triggers, I should be able to handle it."

"Remember to suppress your auras as much as you can," Daren tells us, as we advance through the corridor. "We wouldn't want the lessathi to detect us before we reach them."

 It takes us about another minute to finally reach our destination. The corridor that we are currently in and the corridor that we left from seem to both reunite in this point, and they lead to a much narrower hallway, which has a door at the end. On the other side of the door, the lessathi are still holding their meeting, and they don't seem to have noticed us.

I join Daren and the others into the narrow hallway, and we prepare to storm the meeting room, on his signal.

I also seem to be able to hear the other lessathi from the meeting, although it takes a bit of effort to focus on their words.

 Sadly, they appear to be speaking in the lessathi language, so I can't understand anything of what they're saying.

We travel through the secret tunnel without encountering any form of resistance. When we reach the end of it, Hadrik takes a quick glance towards the rest of us, and then he punches through the wall, clearing our way to the seredium corridor. As we look around us, we see that this tunnel is just as empty as the other ones.

"Arraka," Illuna says, "do you sense any guards?"

"Nope," Arraka says. "It's empty. No magical traps either. Don't know about regular traps, though."

"Well, regular traps tend to get triggered by stepping on the ground," Hadrik says, "so I'll just make sure to throw rocks ahead of us on a regular basis, to see if anything explodes. I'm the one with the tough giant skin here, so I'll go in front. If anything triggers, I should be able to handle it."

"Remember to suppress your auras as much as you can," Daren tells us, as we advance through the corridor. "We wouldn't want the lessathi to detect us before we reach them."

I suddenly hear a voice at the far end of the corridor. It doesn't take me long to recognize it as being the voice of the lessathi that came to visit me while I was in my cell below the arena. I also seem to be able to hear the other lessathi from the meeting, although it takes a bit of effort to focus on their words.

 "That does indeed seem like our only alternative," says the soft-spoken lessathi who visited my cell, in the lessathi language. "Ollendor has already been isolated from most of Varathia, so the rest of the kingdoms will most likely not care if Thilias decides to cut all diplomatic ties with Ollendor as well. The gnome is probably going to do this either way, so there should be no reason for us to intervene."
"Ollendor is the least of our worries, right now," says another lessathi. "Do you have any idea how many mages have died since the beginning of this tournament? This is why I've insisted from the very beginning that the tournament should have had a rule to prohibit the mages from killing each other unless the rules of the tournament explicitly required them to!"

"We've talked about this before," the soft-spoken lessathi says, in a calm tone. "The kings would not agree to it, remember? They said that it was against Varathian tradition to impose such a rule in a tournament, even if the participants are all outsiders."

"To hell with the kings and their outdated traditions!" the other lessathi says. "Don't you understand? They've ruined everything! Why did I even bother to sabotage the telepathic device meant to transmit the objectives, if the mages were going to kill each other before the first round anyway?"

"You've been complaining about this in every single meeting we've had since the beginning of the tournament," another lessathi says. "Give it a rest, already. What's done is done. Let's just focus on the present, shall we?"

 "Barry!" Daren whispers. "Over here!"
As I take a look towards Daren, I realize that while I was listening to the lessathi conversation, we'd already reached our destination. The corridor that we are currently in and the corridor that we left from seem to both reunite in this point, and they lead to a much narrower hallway, which has a door at the end. On the other side of the door, the lessathi are still holding their meeting, and they don't seem to have noticed us.

I join Daren and the others into the narrow hallway, and we prepare to storm the meeting room, on his signal.

Just as we prepare to charge into their headquarters, I suddenly feel an electric shock all throughout my body, and I fall to the ground, unable to move. The same thing apparently happened to all of my friends, because they're now also lying on the ground beside me.

This spell... Could it be?...

As we all lie on the ground, unable to break free from the spell's effects, the door in front of us opens, and the four lessathi that were participating in the meeting are now slowly advancing towards us. They are all wearing their signature dark blue robes, with their hoods up, and each of them seems to be carrying a different type of weapon.

"Welcome, friends," says the soft-spoken lessathi who came to visit me in my cell below the arena, in the Common language. "I believe I've already had the pleasure of meeting some of you, but the others may not know who I am. It doesn't matter, because we will be the ones asking the questions, and you will be the ones answering. Do I make myself clear?"

 One of the other lessathi says something to the lessathi from earlier. He is, however, speaking in the lessathi language, so I can't understand a word he's saying.
"Where are your manners?" the soft-spoken lessathi says, in the Common language. "These are our guests! We should all speak in the Common language, so they can understand us."

The lessathi from before speaks again, but he ignores the other's request, and keeps using the lessathi language.

"Well, it doesn't matter if you want to speak in Common or not," the soft-spoken lessathi says. "We don't need more than one person to interrogate them anyway."

 "I told you that this would happen!" says another lessathi, also in the Common language. "That idiotic king's servant was never the type that could tell when he was being followed."
"Indeed," the soft-spoken lessathi says. "Your idea to leak the time and place of our meeting to the king's servant was definitely worth the effort. What I don't understand, however, is how they managed to avoid the explosion trap. I would have expected them to take the same route to our headquarters as the one that the king's servant usually takes when coming here. Do you suppose that the king actually has a map of the underground tunnels?"

"It doesn't really matter," says the lessathi from before. "What matters now is that we get as much information from them as possible. There's no use trying to interrogate the ones who can't talk due to the paralysis. Only the two lessathi should be able to speak right now. We'll just quickly find out what we need to know, and then we'll get rid of them."

 These cocky bastards. They're using Eiden's paralysis spell. I'm sure of it. This narrow corridor is the perfect place to set up such a trap. And the periodic shocks I'm getting are definitely electric in nature. Due to my partial resistance to electricity that I get from being a lessathi, it should be easy enough for me to find the right time window to spring out of the spell's area of effect, and I'm pretty sure that Leila is in the same situation as me. The others might take a bit longer to get the timing right, though, since the windows they'll get will be extremely short.
As I lie there on the ground, a very small, barely noticeable, semi-transparent message appears right in front of my eyes, written in blue text.

"Don't free yourself yet," Leila's text says. "Wait for the others to get accustomed to the shocks. I'm also sending this message to everyone else. I'll give the signal, so we can all free ourselves together, at the exact same moment."

 "Where the hell did you hide your trap?" Arraka shouts all of a sudden. "I've been searching for it since you came out of that door, and I'm not sensing any device that could cast this type of spell!"
It is unclear to me whether Arraka saw Leila's message and is now trying to buy us some time, or if she's just genuinely frustrated that her magical sense is not good enough to find the trap on her own. If I were to guess, then I'd say it's probably the latter reason.

"Well, it wouldn't be much of a trap if you could just detect it before you walked into it, now, would it?" the soft-spoken lessathi says.

"Wait, who are you talking to?" says the lessathi that agreed to speak in Common. "Where did that voice come from?"

"I'm talking to the banshee in the amulet, of course," the soft-spoken lessathi says. "Arraka, I believe, is her name. I heard that she was trapped in there by a rogue group of lessathi some twenty years ago. At any rate, the banshee is not the one that I'm interested in talking to."

 He then walks towards me, getting within range of the electrical shock spell, but he doesn't seem to be affected by it. Could he be using some trinket that gives him protection against electricity?
"This is the one that I'm interested in talking to," the lessathi says, as he gets closer to me. "I honestly wasn't expecting to see you again, fellow lessathi. You are tenacious, I'll give you that. Well, no matter. This isn't important. What's important is how you managed to reach our location in one piece. Tell me, was it Golmyck that gave you the map of the underground tunnels?

As he was talking, I was busy counting the seconds until the next electric shock.

I stop the count about two seconds before the incoming electrical current, and I jump to my feet, making sure that I'm just out of the paralyzing spell's range, while grabbing the lessathi in front of me with both my hands. Before he has the time to react, I lift him in the air, and I smash him head-first into a nearby wall, cracking his skull wide-open.

I then grab the lessathi's arm before he has the time to react, twisting it behind his back, and forcing him to release his grip on his weapon. Immediately afterwards, I grab his dagger from him, and I quickly use it to slit his throat, while I still keep a firm grip on his arm with my other hand. The lessathi tries to stop the bleeding from his neck by covering his wound with his hands for a few seconds, but eventually he falls to the ground, and he stops moving soon after.

He then swings his own dagger at me, which forces me to jump back towards a wall, while avoiding to re-enter the range of the electric trap. As I jump back, however, I suddenly realize that the lessathi's dagger swing was never meant to actually hit me, but to send a spray of acid towards my face. 

Unable to get out of its way fast enough, I get hit by the acid head-on, and I quickly begin to feel the pain of my face slowly melting from the acid's corrosive effect. It doesn't take long for the lessathi to take advantage of this opportunity, and he rushes towards me with his dagger, this time stabbing me in the neck, and killing me on the spot.

The very thought that I had to share the same room for extended periods of time with this abomination makes me want to puke. And to make matters worse, there was also that idiot caretaker who used to treat her like she was an actual lessathi. Disgusting."

He then turns towards Leila, when he sees the expression in her eyes change.

"Oh, I'm sorry, are you upset because I'm bad-mouthing your 'father'?" the lessathi says. "Well, you know what? Your stupid father deserved much worse than the fate that he got. Parasytes like him should be happy that they are even allowed to live as slaves. They have no place in our society. You may have freed him for now, but we'll get him back, don't worry. And when we do, we are going to give him the fate he truly deserves. The fate of a useless piece of trash."

As Leila's eyes fill with rage, she completely forgets about the signal, and she jumps on the lessathi in front of her, thrusting one of her knives directly into his heart. I quickly take advantage of this opportunity, and I also jump to my feet, making sure that I'm just out of the paralyzing spell's range and aiming my dagger at the throat of the lessathi that was closest to me. The soft-spoken lessathi was not looking at me, and my attack takes him completely by surprise. He tries to jump backwards, but it's too late, and I manage to slit his throat in one single movement.

At the same time, the Leila that was on the ground just a second ago has turned into the lessathi, who is now looking at me with a malicious grin.
An illusion?... No... No, no, no! It can't be!

I turn Leila around, and I see that her eyes are closed, and she is no longer breathing, while the blood stain on her blouse keeps getting larger. Kate is now staring at me with an incredulous look in her eyes, as she seems completely paralyzed, even though she is far away from the trap's range. Taking advantage of my distraction, the lessathi quickly picks up one of Leila's daggers from the ground, and he slits my throat wide open, causing me to die in the next few seconds.

 Something is definitely off, here, but I can't quite put my finger on it. I'll just wait for a little longer to see what happens.
"Barry, please!" Leila writes, again, as the lessathi closes in on her with his dagger, while struggling to find his way towards her due to the lingering effects of the blinding flash from earlier.

Damn, it... I guess I'll go immobilize the lessathi for now, and I'll figure out what's wrong later.

Just as I'm about to reach the lessathi, Kate suddenly shoots three ice cones into Leila's waist, causing her to scream in pain. Wait... Scream? Since when can Leila scream?

My question soon gets answered, as the Leila that was on the ground slowly fades into thin air, and she is replaced by the lessathi from before, who is clutching at his abdomen, trying desperately to stop the bleeding. At the same time, the lessathi that was in front of me turns into Leila, who is now staring at the screaming lessathi in front of her, with her dagger still in her hand.

An illusion? It was an illusion all along? How did I not figure this out sooner?

While I'm busy questioning myself, Kate wastes no time, and she finishes off the last remaining lessathi by sending an ice dagger flying into his head. She then turns to look at me, and she shakes her head in disapproval.

 " 'Help me, Barry' ?" she says. "Seriously? When's the last time you've seen Leila play the damsel in distress? Especially against a weakling such as this?"
"Hold on," I say. "You're not going to tell me that Leila's call for help was the only thing that led you to believe that she was in fact the lessathi, are you?"

"Actually, that is exactly what I'm going to tell you," Kate says.

"But what if you were wrong?" I ask her, shocked.

"Then Daren would have had to cast an extra healing spell," Kate says. "I made sure to not hit any vital spots with my first few cones, just in case, so there would have been no lasting damage."

"Wow..." I say. "Uh... I'm not sure how to react to this."

"Just react like you always do," Kate says. "With a quip."

She pauses, as she sees Daren and the others starting to free themselves from the effects of the paralysis trap.

"Come on," Kate says. "We should search their headquarters and see if we can find anything useful. With a little luck, I might find some information about Diane."

 "That was way too close!" Daren says, as we all begin to enter the headquarters. "We really need to do something about our vulnerability to electricity."
"Yeah," Hadrik says. "I don't think I've felt like having so little control of a situation since that time we got shocked by Kate's elementalist friend. If Barry hadn't figured out how this spell worked before we got here, we would have been goners."

"Well, I guess It's a good thing that you have a friend who spent his life nerding it up in libraries," I say. "Isn't that right, Daren?"

"Yeah, yeah..." Daren says, and we all begin to search the desks in the lessathi's room.

It takes us a few minutes of searching, but we eventually realize that every single drawer is completely empty.

"Damn..." Daren says. "Not even a single document. Do you think that they may have emptied out their headquarters before this meeting, as a precautionary measure, on the off-chance that they actually got defeated?"

"They may have done it way before that," I say. "If they were already suspecting that the king's servant got followed here, they probably considered this location to be compromised, so they made sure to not leave anything of value in this place."

"I guess you're right..." Daren says. "So, I suppose we should be getting back to the castle, then?"

"Yes," Kate says. "I'm definitely not going to find out any information about Diane from this place. Let's go back."

 "You know..." I tell Kate, as we prepare to exit the headquarters. "You could have left that last lessathi alive, in order to interrogate him. You already had him more or less immobilized, with that first set of ice cones that you shot in his abdomen, so he shouldn't have been much of a threat."
"I didn't want to risk it," Kate says. "That lessathi was practically the illusionist of their group, and he may well have had other tricks up his sleeve. It's never a good idea to leave illusionists alive after a fight."

"What do you guys think... should we take these weapons with us?" Hadrik says, as we pass the lessathi's corpses.

"Oh, we definitely should be taking them," I say. "I could totally use one of these!"

I then take the emerald encrusted shield from the ground and I start swinging it up and down, in an attempt to cast a spell with it.

"Hmm..." I say. "I don't recall that lessathi uttering any incantations before he cast his illusion spell or before casting the flash of light that he used to hide the illusion from us. Maybe there's a hidden button or something I'm missing?"

"Let's take these to king Golmyck," Daren says. "He's a tinkerer. He should be able to make sense of how these weapons work."

 "Whoa!" Hadrik says, and he jumps back three feet, after having taken only one step forward. "I almost forgot about that electric trap from earlier."  
"Relax!" I say. "That spell deactivates automatically as soon as everyone in its range leaves the area."

I then go past the area where the trap had been activated before, and I turn around, to face Hadrik.

"See?" I say. "Nothing to worry about. Let's get out of here."

We grab the lessathi weapons, and we begin to head back, following the exact same route that we took on our way here. As soon as we reach the corridor below the king's basement, Hadrik starts throwing rocks at the trapdoor above us, in order to get the king's attention. A few seconds later, the trapdoor opens up, and the extensive ladder drops all the way down, just like before.

"It's going to be a bit difficult to climb this ladder while carrying these lessathi weapons," Daren says.

"Can't you somehow strap them to your back like you did with your shield?" I say.

 "Well, the shield is made to be strapped to your back when you travel for extended periods of time," Daren says. "These weapons don't have any straps, and the shield strap is not designed to hold any other weapons on it."
"You're both making this sound way more complicated than it really is," Hadrik says, as he picks up the lessathi trident. "There's no need to carry these all the way up with us. I can just throw them through the hatch."

He then shouts loudly, to make sure that Golmyck can hear him.

"Hey, Golmyck!" Hadrik shouts. "I'm going to throw some things your way! Some of them have pointy ends. Make sure you stay away from the trapdoor!"

The gnome gives us an okay sign with his hand, and then Hadrik starts tossing all of the weapons through the hatch. As soon as he's done, we all climb the extensive ladder, one by one, and once we reach the king's basement, the trapdoor closes itself back up, behind us.

 "Should I take it that the lessathi are all dead?" the king asks us.
"Yeah, we took them all out," I say.

"Extraordinary," Golmyck says. "And not a single scratch on any of you, either. I'll admit that I'm impressed."

"Just make sure to keep up your end of the bargain," Daren says. "We don't want to see any more slaves on the streets when we come back to this city."

"Of course!" Golmyck says. "I will begin making preparations for the abolition of slavery first thing tomorrow morning. I only wish there were something else I could repay you with, for your help. Given that the mission I've sent you on is a secret, I cannot give any official reason to the treasurer that would justify offering you a reward."

"Hey, there's no need," I say. "We're the ones who volunteered for the mission in the first place. If we wanted payment, we would have asked for it from the get-go."

 "Still... I wouldn't want you to leave empty-handed," the king says. "Hold on, I think I've got something that might be of use to you."
He then disappears under his workbench, and he reappears ten seconds later with a small device in his hand, which only has a screen and a button.

"This device will help you find out if someone is a lessathi or a human," Golmyck says. "You simply need to press this button while aiming the device at someone, and the writing that will appear on the screen will tell you whether they are a lessathi or not. I made it a long time ago, back when I couldn't differentiate between the auras of humans and lessathi with my magical sense. I haven't really used it in years, so you can have it if you want it."

"So, about these lessathi weapons that Hadrik threw into your room..." Daren says.

"Ah, yes," Golmyck says. "Let me have a look."

"I tried to get that shield to activate, but I just couldn't find any switch on it," I say, as the gnome studies the lessathi weapons, closely.

"Well, it's no wonder," Golmyck says. "These weapons have clearly been designed to only work in the hands of the individuals that they were tailored for. If you don't have the exact aura signatures of the lessathi who were using these devices, I doubt that you could get any use out of them. This measure was probably taken in order to avoid having their enemies use their own weapons against them."

"So, they are completely useless, then?" I say.

"Not entirely," Golmyck says. "As weapons, they have no use, but if I disassemble them, I might just find some parts that I could use on some of my other devices."

 "Oh," I say. "Speaking of your devices, I just remembered that I overheard the lessathi say something important about that telepathic device of yours, while they were still in the meeting. It turns out that they are the ones who sabotaged the device, in order to delay the first round of the tournament. From what I could understand, it seemed that they had some sort of a plan that they needed to carry out until the beginning of the first round, and they needed as much time as possible to get it done properly, but things didn't really seem to work out in the end, because a lot more mages died than they were expecting, which messed up their plan, somehow."
"Hmm," Golmyck says. "I definitely remember them trying to convince the other kings to insert a rule in the tournament where the participants couldn't kill each other unless the rules explicitly required them to. So, it was sabotage, that caused the malfunction... That would explain why the device was behaving so erratically, no matter how many times I tried to tinker with it. How interesting. This information will certainly help me to fix the device faster. Thank you for letting me know!"

"You heard what the lessathi were discussing during their meeting?" Daren asks me.

"Yeah, I could hear them from far away, thanks to my hearing stat," I tell Daren, offhandedly. "So, anyway, I guess we should be taking our backpacks, then. It's getting late, and we still have a feast we need to attend to."

 "Alright," the king says. "Remember to not say anything about your secret mission while you are outside this room. The lessathi may be dead, but their spies are still alive and kicking. Many of them will probably leave the city as soon as they find out that they no longer have any employers to pay them, but some of the more loyal ones may seek revenge, and you wouldn't want to get yourself or your friends targeted by any of these assassins. I will have my own spies and assassins deal with these more loyal followers of the lessathi in due time, but for now, we should all be careful."
"Yeah, we'll be careful," Daren says.

 We grab our backpacks, we wave goodbye to the king, and we go climb the stairs to the throne room. The king's servant was still there, and he had a rather uneasy look in his eyes, when he saw us finally exit the king's basement, after more than two hours, but he said nothing, and he led us outside, just like the last time when we came to the castle. 
About an hour and a half later, we finally reach the mansion, where Enrique was waiting for us impatiently.

"Finally!" Enrique says. "I was almost beginning to think that you might not show up!"

"Yeah, sorry about that," Daren says. "Our meeting with the king took a bit longer than we anticipated."

"Well, what's important is that you are here," Enrique says. "The food is already done. I will tell the cooks to reheat it, and we will begin eating shortly."

About fifteen minutes later, Enrique comes out of the kitchen, followed by five cooks, each carrying plates of food, and each of them bringing a completely different specialty dish to the table. I would not be surprised if these dishes actually tasted better than what Flower can magically conjure, given her relatively limited knowledge of the culinary arts. After the cooks are done placing all of the dishes on one of the bigger picnic tables from the yard, Rose's siblings also join us, and we all seat ourselves at the table, getting ready for the well-earned feast.

 We spend the next few hours eating, drinking, and celebrating our long-awaited release from the arena.
The food provided to us by the cooks actually did turn out to be on par with Flower's magically conceived delicacies, if not better. There were so many dishes on that table of which I'd never heard before, that it looked almost as if I were participating in a royal banquet of some kind. The cooks were initially all standing up in a line, in front of the table, waiting for us to order refills, but after a whole hour of Hadrik insisting that they join us for a drink, they eventually gave in, and began to slowly loosen up, as the effect of the dwarven ale was starting to set in. Towards the end of the celebration, Enrique made sure to supply us all with Rose's special herbs, so we could start fresh in the morning, without fear of any hangovers.

 As Hadrik and the others are nearing the end of their card game, Enrique comes out of the kitchen, followed by five cooks, each carrying plates of food, and each of them bringing a completely different specialty dish to the table. I would not be surprised if these dishes actually tasted better than what Flower can magically conjure, given her relatively limited knowledge of the culinary arts. After the cooks are done placing all of the dishes on one of the bigger picnic tables from the yard, Rose's siblings also join us, and we all seat ourselves at the table, getting ready for the well-earned feast.

 We spend the next few hours eating, drinking, and celebrating our long-awaited release from the arena.
The food provided to us by the cooks actually did turn out to be on par with Flower's magically conceived delicacies, if not better. There were so many dishes on that table of which I'd never heard before, that it looked almost as if I were participating in a royal banquet of some kind. The cooks were initially all standing up in a line, in front of the table, waiting for us to order refills, but after a whole hour of Hadrik insisting that they join us for a drink, they eventually gave in, and began to slowly loosen up, as the effect of the dwarven ale was starting to set in. Towards the end of the celebration, Enrique made sure to supply us all with Rose's special herbs, so we could start fresh in the morning, without fear of any hangovers.

 As Hadrik and the others are nearing the end of their card game, Rose comes out of the kitchen, carrying two trays of food. I go to her side, to take one of the trays off her hands, and then I help her set the table, at one of the larger picnic tables in the yard. Rose's siblings, who were playing in the yard are now also joining us, while Rose and I head towards the kitchen, to bring the rest of the food outside.

 We spend the next few hours eating, drinking, and celebrating our long-awaited release from the arena.
The food that Rose cooked for us was definitely tasty, but it had been a long time since we had the opportunity to taste any of Flower's delicacies, so in the end, our feast was a combination of homemade and magically conceived food. As usual, Hadrik was more than happy to provide us with the drinks for the occasion, and Rose also made sure to supply us with her special herbs, so we could start fresh in the morning, without fear of any hangovers.

 Since we needed to get up before sunrise the next day, we had to end the celebration early, in order to get at least a few hours of sleep, but the hours that we spent at that table were exactly what we needed, after what we'd been through in the past few days.
The next morning, while it was still dark outside, we all lined up in the yard, to give Enrique our farewells.

"Well, I've only had the pleasure of talking to you for a few hours in total," Enrique says, "but they were hours well spent. I will never forget you, my friends. I hope you will all get to accomplish your goals, whether they be winning the tournament, or whatever else your hearts may desire!"

"Goodbye, Enrique," Daren says. "Remember to keep that transceiver that I gave you earlier with you at all times. You never know when we may need to contact each other again, especially while the tournament is still in progress."

 We all wave goodbye to Enrique and we set out to find the northern gate. After losing our way a few times, and having to ask the locals for directions on numerous occasions, we finally manage to reach our destination, just as the sun rises, and as we get a good look at the city gates, we see that Melindra was already waiting for us there, with her back leaning against a wall.
As she waves at us, to make sure that we've spotted her, we quicken our pace, and we get ready to finally take our first step towards our original goal. After so much sidetracking, and so many delays, at long last, we can get back to what we came here to do. Participating in the Magium Tournament.

"I wish you all the best, Rose," Kate tells Rose, after she's done hugging her. "I promise that I'll never forget you!"

"There you go again, making it sound as if this is the last time we'll ever see each other," Rose says, smiling. "You didn't come here to die, did you? As long as you all stay alive, then I'm sure our paths will cross again. Not to mention that you also have those transceivers with you, so you can call me any time, without worries. It will be as if I were never gone from your group in the first place!"

"I... suppose you're right," Kate says.

"I... suppose you're right," Kate says.

"And besides," Rose says, this time with a teasing smile, "Barry told me that he will come back for me as soon as he wins the tournament, so if you'll still be travelling in the same group by then, we should be meeting again before long!"

Hadrik laughs.

"Well, if Barry said that, then I'm sure it must be true!" he says.

"Oh, shut up," I tell him.
