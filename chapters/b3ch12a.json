If you don't give him something to do, he'll start testing that obnoxious spell of his with the blinding flash of light over and over again, and none of us want that.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey,\" I say, \"you should be grateful that I tested that spell as many times as I did. The last thing you'd want during a tense fight would be for me to blind you by accident because I didn't practice enough. That spell has very delicate timing, you know.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sure it does,\" Illuna tells me in a dismissive tone, and then she picks up the amulet again so she can speak louder into it. \"Arraka, seriously, what are you doing? We've been calling out to you for ages and you haven't responded at all. Don't make me spin you.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, alright!\" Arraka says, in an exasperated tone. \"I'll give Barry his blasted task. Just give me one more minute. I'm kind of in the middle of something.\"<br/><br/>\"Let me guess,\" Illuna says. \"You're trying to find an explosion spell that requires less energy to cast, so that you can take us by surprise the next time when you try to escape from the amulet. Is that it?\"<br/><br/>\"Wrong,\" Arraka says. \"If there were a faster explosion spell, I would have used it years ago. But if you have to know, I am currently trying to create a modified version of my soul absorption spell where instead of absorbing the host's soul, I fuse with them, and we both get equal control of the body.\"<br/><br/> \"You mean... like me and Flower?\" Illuna asks, perplexed. \"But... why? What could you possibly have to gain from doing something like this on purpose? I thought you hated it when you got fused with Therius by accident.\"<br/>\"I did,\" Arraka says. \"But you see, the thing is that if I ever do escape from my amulet again, for whatever reason, I can't afford to take over Flower's body the same way as last time, because then you'd both essentially be dead, everyone would attack me to avenge you again, and I'd be forced to murder them all, for good this time.\"<br/><br/>\"And why exactly would that be a problem for you?...\" Illuna asks, still just as confused as before. \"You've already killed us once. Why not just do it again?\"<br/><br/>\"Because then my whole plan to use you all to take my vengeance upon the gods would be ruined!\" Arraka shouts. \"I'm not going to get another opportunity like this in a million years! Where else do you think I'm going to find another clown troupe that has a personal beef with one of the gods and has a minimal chance of killing them with my guidance? You think I want to go back to my boring old plan of just killing them myself after I came up with a genius idea like this?\"<br/><br/> \"You can't be serious...\" Illuna says. \"You're telling me that you're willing to live together with me AND Flower in the same mind, while sharing control of the body with both of us, just for the sake of your plan?\"<br/>\"Yeah, sure, why not?\" Arraka says, in a casual tone. \"We can have the tea parties with biscuits and whatever in the morning, and then we'll do the murder sprees in the evening. I'm sure we can work something out.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, but I am finding this very hard to believe...\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"As you should,\" Arraka tells her. \"If you would have been so easily ready to trust the word of someone who already killed you once, then it would have meant that you've learned nothing from me during the years when you were my pupil.\"<br/><br/>",

I miss my timing by about half a second, and the spell does not activate.<br/><br/>Still, that went much better than I thought it would.

Is this a dizziness spell I'm feeling?

I've already experienced this before on the ethereal plane and I know how to fix it. All I need to do is follow their direction with my hands, and they will eventually fall back into place.<br/><br/>\"That's interesting,\" Arraka says, as the magical particles from my spell are now rearranging themselves into the correct form. \"I would have expected you to try to force the particles back into their proper position instead of following them. Where did you learn this technique from?\"<br/><br/>\"I learned it from an old hermit,\" I tell her, offhandedly, as I am still focusing on my spell. \"I don't really remember what his name was. I don't think he ever told me, actually...\"<br/><br/>\"He had skills like this and he lived as a hermit?!\" Arraka asks, shocked. \"What an incredible waste of talent. If I ever get out of this amulet, he'll be one of the first people that I'll take on as my apprentices. Remind me to ask you for his address if I don't end up killing you by then.\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, sure,\" I say, as I'm still casting the same spell. \"So, can I cancel the spell now, or do I still need to keep this up for another-- whoa...\"<br/>While I was talking, a ridiculously small arrow made out of fire shot out of my hands and went straight for the tree that I was targeting. The flaming projectile hit the tree head on, but the intensity of it was so low that it barely made a scorch mark on the tree's bark before getting extinguished completely.<br/><br/>\"Hahahaha, it worked!\" I say, excitedly. \"I can't believe it actually worked! You're a genius!\"<br/><br/>\"Of course I'm a genius!\" Arraka says. \"Did you seriously expect anything less from the spirit who killed half of the gods on the magical plane?\"<br/><br/>\"I swear I'll never doubt you again!\" I say. \"Wow, I'm still in shock. This is simply unbelievable!\"<br/><br/>\"No...\" Illuna says, looking at me as if I'd gone completely mad. \"What is unbelievable is that the two of you are getting excited over a fire spell that couldn't even burn the bark of a tree. Two whole days of following Arraka's nonsensical instructions and this is the result? How can you not see that she is making a fool out of you?\"<br/><br/>\"Why would she be making a fool out of me?\" I ask Illuna, confused. \"Every part of her training so far has made perfect sense.\"<br/><br/> \"You've got to be joking...\" Illuna says. \"Just a short while ago, I was watching you literally banging your head against that tree a thousand times in a row. You're really trying to tell me that this had anything to do with you learning magic?\"  <br/>\"No, of course not,\" I say. \"It had nothing to do with me learning magic.\"<br/><br/>\"Then why would you do it?!\" Illuna asks, looking as if she's finally losing her cool.<br/><br/>\"Because he's a generalist,\" Arraka says. \"He's the only one in this group who understands enough magical theory that I don't need to jump through hoops to make him follow my instructions, no matter how idiotic and nonsensical they may seem to the rest of you. He may have disagreed with how well my training would work in practice, but he knew that there were no flaws in the theory behind it. He would have never accepted to do any of this otherwise.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say, \"the whole thing with hitting my head against the tree so that I could imprint my aura onto it and make it an easier target for my spell was something that I tried to do many years before I could use magic. It's not really a very well-known method of training, because it's hard to take seriously, but it can have an immensely positive effect on mages with very weak magical power who can't learn to cast spells any other way.\"<br/><br/>\"But why would you need to go through all this trouble NOW, when you can already cast magic?\" Illuna says. \"Why not simply cast it through the use of your stat device?\"<br/><br/>",

I made him cast the easiest spell that couldn't possibly be included in his device, because his stat booster was invented over six hundred years ago and the fire arrow spell was only created a hundred years later. I don't think you understand just how much of a leap forward this is. Until now, Barry was under the impression that casting anything other than the spells included in his device was fundamentally impossible. Now that we've clearly established that he can cast other spells as well, this has opened up an infinite amount of new options for him. With enough practice, he might be able to learn to cast some of the special spells designed by me, and hell, maybe even primordial spells. It's only a matter of time at this point.\"<br/>\"I... didn't realize you two were actually thinking so far ahead,\" Illuna says, now appearing to have calmed down.<br/><br/>\"Well... why wouldn't we?\" I say. \"We ARE trying to kill a god, aren't we?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes...\" Illuna says. \"I suppose we are. And the fact that we seem to be getting realistically closer to this goal makes me doubt my own sanity more and more with every passing day...\"<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"You ain't seen nothing yet! Stick with me and soon, killing a few gods will feel like an ordinary afternoon!\"<br/><br/> \"Hey, Hadrik!\" I tell the dwarf as he is passing by us, looking just as puzzled as Illuna was in the beginning. \"Pour me a glass of ale, would you? I just cast my first fire arrow! See that scorch mark over there on the tree? That was me! Hahahaha!\"<br/>\"Uhm... good for you, man!\" Hadrik says, as he pats me on the back, very unconvinced. \"Good for you!\"<br/><br/>Soon after Hadrik takes out the glass, Diane joins us as well, and then Kate and Daren also head over to us to see what the commotion was all about. It took me some time to explain to them why casting this insignificant spell was such a big deal for me, and to convince them that I hadn't completely taken leave of my senses when I agreed to smash my head against a tree for a whole hour, but once I cleared up everything, we all sat down in a circle and enjoyed the rest of our evening, taking a brief rest from all of our trainings.<br/><br/>\"So, Barry, now that you can cast any spell you want, without any limitations, what are you planning to try next?\" Flower asks me, as she subtly tries to pick up a bottle of dwarven ale, but then her eyes briefly turn blue and she slaps her own hand away from the bottle. \"If you want some suggestions, I highly recommend the spell where you make a huge dragon out of flames that you can use to--\"<br/><br/>\"I doubt that's how it works,\" Illuna interrupts her. \"He might not be limited by the list of spells provided by his device anymore, but his magical power level is still very low. This means that he will only be able to cast very weak spells for the time being.\"<br/><br/> \"Exactly,\" Arraka says. \"See, this is why the spells made by me are so great, compared to the ones created by all the other simpletons. With my original spells, you are not limited by the amount of energy that you have at your disposal. You can make the spells as strong or as weak as you want, depending on how much energy you want to spend on them.\"<br/>\"Now you're beginning to sound like a salesperson that is trying much too hard to sell their faulty products,\" Illuna says. \"We only just saw that the fire arrow that Barry cast works the same way, so clearly your spells are not as unique as you're making them out to be.\"<br/><br/>\"Pfft...\" Arraka says. \"Fire arrow doesn't count. That's one of the newer spells. Show me a spell from before five thousand years ago that does what my spells do, and then we'll talk.\"<br/><br/>\"Aaanyway...\" I say. \"To answer Flower's question, I suppose that what I'd want to try out first are some spells with easier flows to recreate, so that I can get some more practice before I begin with the complicated ones. I'd probably start with something like the frog summoning spell from the Beginner's guide to summoning magic. Hmm, or maybe the floating dagger spell that those scam artists like to use when they pretend to be juggling. Oh, or I could try the one spell where you can make little sparks fly in the air like tiny fireworks!\"<br/><br/>\"Or... here's an idea,\" Arraka says. \"How about you try out a spell that isn't completely useless?\"<br/><br/>",

There is essentially no magical counter or protection against it, but its effects can easily be rendered useless through non-magical means. All you need to do is focus your eyes on three different places in front of you within the span of five seconds and the spell will be canceled, but if you don't do that, you will get a headache the likes of which you've probably never had the pleasure to experience in your lifetime. The main drawback is that the spell is incredibly difficult to learn, and most people won't bother to spend so much time practicing something that can so easily be countered by a regular person with no magic, just by looking around a little.\"<br/>\"You know...\" I say. \"It would really help me out if you guys allowed me to cast some of these targeted spells on you once or twice, just so I could get a feel of how they work before using them in combat. I know you don't really like the idea, but--\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, Barry,\" Kate says. \"I know you mean no harm, and I value your friendship, but simply the thought of being experimented on again after what I went through at the Beacon as a child is-- I'm just not very keen on repeating that experience.\"<br/><br/>\"No, no, that's totally understandable,\" I say. \"My bad. I should have thought about this before making that request.\"<br/><br/> \"As for me,\" Daren says, \"the main problem is that many of my protection spells have limited uses per day, so I'd rather not cancel them unless it's absolutely necessary. And casting your spells on me while my protections are still up wouldn't really be of much help to you, because you wouldn't know if they worked or not.\"<br/>\"It would still help me a little to cast them on you even with your protections active, but I get your point,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Barry, I didn't know you were in need of a test subject!\" Diane says. \"I'd love to help!\"<br/><br/>\"Are you... sure?\" I ask her, a little apprehensively. \"I wouldn't want you to force yourself for my sake or anything. You and Kate both grew up in the Beacon of Hope after all...\"<br/><br/>\"Oh you don't have to worry about me,\" Diane says. \"That trauma is far behind me. The idea of you testing spells on me doesn't bother me in the slightest.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, if you're certain about it, then yeah, I could definitely use your help!\" I say. \"Thanks!\"<br/><br/>\"Any time!\" Diane says.<br/><br/>\"Alright, that's enough chit-chat!\" Arraka says, all of a sudden.\"We've got important business to discuss. Kate, I know you've been practicing aura manipulation in secret for the past two days. Are you ever planning to show us what you've accomplished, or are you just doing it as a hobby?\"<br/><br/> \"...I was going to show it to you once I had some more definitive results,\" Kate says. \"At the moment, I'm still not sure if I'm doing it right.\"<br/>\"You were doing fine,\" Arraka says. \"Your only problem is that if you're going to practice interrupting other people's aura manipulation techniques, you're going to need someone actually using such a technique in front of you if you want to make any progress. Daren, you can consistently use your aura to move your sword through the air nowadays, right? Why don't you make your sword float over there, so that Kate can demonstrate to us what she can do?\"<br/><br/>\"Sure,\" Daren says, as he does what Arraka asked of him and makes his sword float in the air. \"Now what?\"<br/><br/>\"Kate, will you do the honors?\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"I'll try...\" Kate says, as she conjures an icicle in the air, coats it with her aura and then sends it flying somewhere between Daren and his floating sword.<br/><br/>\"Whoa...\" Daren says, as he sees his sword drop to the ground in front of him. \"You did it on the first try! Congrats!\"<br/><br/>\"See?\" Arraka tells us. \"She's a natural. And unlike Daren, I didn't even have to teach her anything. She learned it all by herself, while overhearing me give Daren his daily lessons. Now, there's one last thing that I want to test before calling it a day. Kate, why don't you get that brand new scepter of yours and cast a freezing beam on that big rock over there? But I want you to put as much energy into your beam as you can. Max it out, you understand?\"<br/><br/>",

I bet you can recover that much energy in five minutes, if you just lie down and rest for a little while. Now stop whining and do it. This is important.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine,\" Kate says, as she picks up her scepter from the ground and points it at the rock. \"I'll give it a shot.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, and one more thing,\" Arraka says. \"Try to shorten the casting time for your spell as much as you can. We wouldn't want to give your enemy too much of an opportunity to react and get away from your line of attack.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah, that rock will never know what hit it!\" Hadrik jokes, as he takes another drink of ale.<br/><br/>\"I understand,\" Kate responds, and then she begins gathering an immense amount of energy at the tip of her scepter.<br/><br/>Not even two seconds later, a beam of ice shoots out of the scepter, but the power behind it could only be compared with the flame breath that we saw Tyrath use five thousand years ago when he was still in his prime. Needless to say, the rock never stood a chance against such an attack, but even the air around us has gotten as cold as on a winter day. As we are all looking at Kate, shocked, Arraka begins to laugh very loudly, in three voices at once.<br/><br/> \"Aha-Ahahahahahaha!!!\" Arraka laughs. \"I knew it! I knew that this scepter wouldn't let me down! Do you know what this is? Do you KNOW what this is?! It's our secret weapon against my copy from the past, that's what! I remember exactly what defenses I used to have back then, and there's no way I could withstand something like this if I were caught unprepared. All you losers need to do is to get that cheap copy of me sufficiently distracted for two seconds, and Kate will freeze her solid! Oh man, I can't believe you idiots lucked out like this! That trip to the lessathi headquarters was worth it in so many ways!\"<br/>\"So,\" Illuna asks, \"you're saying that your protection spells from five thousand years ago were so weak that you couldn't even protect against a Tyrath-level attack? Because we all saw Tyrath attacking her during the ritual, and she defended against it just fine.\"<br/><br/>\"She didn't 'defend just fine', \"Arraka says. \"It got her sufficiently distracted for Tyrath to teleport you away from danger, which means that Kate's beam should also keep the other Arraka immobilized just long enough for us to deliver the finishing blow.\"<br/><br/> \"And how are we supposed to do that?\" Kate says.<br/>\"With Daren's sword, obviously,\" Arraka says. \"That weapon is so ridiculously enchanted that it can easily pass through pretty much every passive protection spell that exists today, let alone the ones that existed five thousand years ago. Even if she only gets frozen for three seconds, that should still be enough time for this buffoon to cut her in half, as long as he makes sure to stay close enough to her beforehand. The only way to defend against that sword is to either dodge it or use a powerful active protection spell against it, which she obviously won't be able to do because she'll be encased in a block of ice. Wow, this plan gets more perfect the more I think about it!\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " I continue to test my spells on Diane for about half an hour or so, until I've cast most of my useful targeted spells at least once. The dizziness spell seemed to work fine once Diane removed her protection, and she got a small headache for a few seconds, as expected. Other than that, we also tested a few illusion spells, a suggestion spell and several other spells designed primarily to distract or disorient my enemies.<br/>From beginning to end, Diane has followed my instructions perfectly, without complaints of any kind. She has also kept her same playful and outgoing demeanor this whole time, although sometimes it is hard to know what she is really thinking. Unlike Kate, who will often say exactly what is on her mind, no matter how blunt or disrespectful, Diane is more the type who will try to smooth things over with a joke of some kind. However, she can also be very straightforward, impulsive and even hotheaded, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>If I were to take an educated guess based on what I've seen of her so far compared to how she used to act as a child during the God of Time's ritual, I'd say that the more diplomatic side of her personality is likely a result of Meridith's upbringing, whereas her occasional straightforwardness and impulsive attitude are probably traits that she used to have when she was a kid, but is now trying to suppress, because she considers them to be unwanted flaws of her personality.<br/><br/> Ironically, if she acted less composed around us, and more like her younger self, I think she would have had a much easier time befriending everyone, because it would have made her seem a lot more honest.<br/>\"Alright, I think that was the last of the spells I wanted to test,\" I say, after a while. \"Thanks a lot for the help! I really appreciate it!\"<br/><br/>\"Done already?\" Diane asks. \"That's too bad. I was almost starting to get used to the dizziness and feeling of nausea.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, if you feel like you haven't had enough nausea for one day, you could always ask Hadrik for some ale,\" I say. \"It shouldn't take more than a bottle for you to feel the need to throw up again!\"<br/><br/>\"Actually... I don't think Hadrik would really want to share his ale with me,\" Diane tells me, in a more serious tone.<br/><br/> \"Why not?\" I say. \"Did you have a fight with him or something?\"<br/>\"No,\" Diane says, \"it's just that every time I try to talk to him, he seems on edge, and it always feels like he's trying to end the conversation as quickly as possible. To be honest, I can't really say that I blame him. I probably would be acting like that too around someone who left me unconscious in the middle of the sacred woods and almost got me killed. I know we've kind of started off on the wrong foot, and I've been trying to smooth things over with him and everyone else as well as I could in the past two days, but to be quite honest, I haven't had much luck. Do you have any idea of a way I could make him warm up to me? Maybe a favorite game, or favorite food, or at least some sort of conversation starter?\"<br/><br/>",

I've seen you do it in three separate training sessions by now.\"<br/><br/>\"I see,\" Kate says, simply.<br/><br/>\"So, are you going to tell me what's wrong?\" I ask her. \"I don't think I've ever seen you space out like this during your training, so I'm guessing it has to be something pretty serious. Was it something Diane said?\"<br/><br/>\"No, it's not that, it's-- nothing that you should concern yourself with,\" Kate says, apprehensively. \"I'll be fine.\"<br/><br/> \"Okay, let me see if I can get this right on the first guess,\" I tell her. \"Your one main goal since the first day you joined the tournament has always been to find Diane, and to take her with you, away from Varathia. However, now that you've finally had the chance to meet her and talk to her, you've realized that Diane has no intention to leave this place, and that she is working together with the lessathi of her own free will. In other words, the reason why you are conflicted right now is because you've realized that the only way for you to be able to stay with your friend after the tournament is over is to join Meridith and the rest of the lessathi, which isn't exactly the most ideal situation for you. Did I guess correctly so far?\"<br/>Kate sighs.<br/><br/>\"Only partially,\" she answers me, after a short pause. \"It's not just about what I'm going to do once the tournament is over. I'm also a little worried about Diane. She seems... changed. It's not that I was expecting her to be the exact same person that she was ten years ago, but when I talk to her now, I feel like I can't even tell what she's thinking half the time. I don't know... I suppose I just can't seem to come to terms with the fact that it was so easy to connect with Leila, despite the fact that we barely interacted while we were at the Beacon, but when it comes to Diane, it feels almost like we are strangers sometimes.\"<br/><br/> \"If it helps,\" I say, \"you should know that you're not the only one having trouble getting close to Diane. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but Hadrik and Daren barely speak to her, and I guess I haven't really had many conversations with her either. There's just something about her that makes her seem a little... insincere, maybe? Not that I'm calling her a liar, or anything, but sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm talking to, uh... to a female version of the king of the underground.\"<br/>\"Barry, that's it!\" Kate says loudly, all of a sudden. \"I think that's what's been bothering me all this time! Something about her feels similar to the king of the underground, but I'm not sure exactly what. I'll try to see if I can figure it out in the next few days, and maybe that will help me feel a little more comfortable talking to her!\"<br/><br/>\"So, that's one problem partly solved,\" I say. \"But what about the other one? Have you thought about what you are going to do once the tournament ends, and Diane inevitably tells you that she wants to stay here, in Varathia, and continue to work for Meridith?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm... not sure yet,\" Kate says, as she looks to the side. \"To be frank, I've been kind of postponing that decision, knowing that we still have some time until we reach Galamir. It's not that I hate Meridith or anything, but I wouldn't exactly want to spend my life working for her either.\"<br/><br/>",

Maybe we can work something out.\"<br/><br/>She pauses for a few brief moments before continuing.<br/><br/>\"Thank you...\" she tells me, after a while. \"This conversation with you ended up helping me more than I thought it would.

        "text": " On my way there, I pass by Diane, who was apparently still in a discussion with Arraka, ever since she was done helping me with testing my spells. Now that I think about it, I may have seen her talking with Arraka once or twice before, and for some reason, they seem to actually be getting along quite well. I wonder if there's something I'm missing, here...<br/>\"Can I ask you one question?\" Diane says to Arraka, as I've now stopped in my tracks to listen to their conversation. \"What's it like in the magical plane? I keep hearing you talk about it, but I don't really have any real world examples to compare it to, and it's a bit difficult to fill the gaps just with my imagination.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Arraka says. \"You're an ethereal, right? Well, the magical plane actually feels pretty similar to the ether on the ethereal plane, except instead of an endless plane of light, it's an endless plane of magical energy, if that makes any sense to you. I'm not sure if I can explain it any more clearly than this to someone who hasn't actually experienced it.\"<br/><br/>\"No, no, that is actually a really good explanation!\" Diane says. \"I'm glad we had this talk. Anyway, it's getting late, so I think I'll be signing off for the night.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, yes, certainly!\" Arraka says, in an uncharacteristically pleasant voice. \"Just one last question, if you would be so kind. What color is the sky right now?\"<br/><br/>\"The sky?\" Diane asks, with a smile, as she takes a quick look at the dark sky above us. \"Why, it's bright pink, of course! Just like any other day!\"<br/><br/> \"My thanks!\" Arraka tells her, in the same pleasant voice, as Diane takes a courteous bow, and she goes towards her tent.<br/>\"So, uh... I see you're really getting along with Diane, huh?\" I ask Arraka, as I now approach Flower and Illuna.<br/><br/>\"Oh, yes, the girl is wonderful!\" Arraka tells me. \"Did you know that I've been asking her the exact same question at the end of every conversation we've had, and she's been giving me the same answer, but the reaction of her aura was different each time?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm... not sure if I understand what that means,\" I tell her.<br/><br/>\"She's using the same aura concealment technique that the king of the underground was using,\" Arraka explains to me. \"I think she must have learned it from Meridith, because all of the lessathi were using a crude version of this technique, but only Meridith and Diane are proficient enough in it to be on the level of the king of the underground, or maybe even greater than that. Essentially, they are controlling their auras so well that they can almost completely mask whether they are lying or not, and on top of that, they also like to make their auras tremble slightly at random intervals, to make it seem like they are lying even when they are telling the truth.\"<br/><br/>\"Interesting...\" I say. \"Do you think they're all using this as a precaution, in case they ever get interrogated by Eiden?\"<br/><br/> \"Most likely, yes,\" Arraka says. \"It's definitely a unique skill to have, I'll give them that. I wasn't really paying much attention to it before I noticed this with the king of the underground, but now I am gaining more and more of an interest in it.\"<br/>\"So, what were you two talking about before I came by?\" I say. \"You both seemed to be really enjoying yourselves.\"<br/><br/>\"To be honest, I don't even remember what the main topic of our conversation was, and probably neither does Diane,\" Arraka says. \"We're just playing a game, she and I. A game in which the objective is for me to figure out the way in which her aura concealment works, while she plays around with me and smiles confidently, from a position of clear superiority. It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of being the underdog in any game or competition involving magic, so I'm enjoying this to my fullest.\"<br/><br/>\"Does this mean that you're not getting anywhere close to figuring her out, then?\" I ask Arraka.<br/><br/>\"Oh, she will slip up eventually, I'm sure,\" Arraka says. \"It's only a matter of time.\"<br/><br/>",

How many more of these wild stories do you still have, anyway?\"<br/>\"I wouldn't really call any of them 'wild',\" I tell him. \"Most of the stuff I told you about was just odd jobs that I did here and there so that I could continue to fund my research for becoming a mage. These are not exactly the kinds of things that people would write books about, like any of your achievements for instance.\"<br/><br/>\"Well maybe they should write books about them!\" Daren says. \"This is some exciting stuff! I'm serious! You really had me by the edge of my seat with some of those stories. I swear, I have no idea if all these people you've met in your life were crazy before they met you or if they slowly turned insane after spending too much time with you, but it's amazing how many likeminded people you've encountered on your path until now. I think the one I'm most surprised of has to be Brinhorn. He always seemed like a man with a good head on his shoulders. How in the gods' names did you manage to rope him into this madness?\"<br/><br/> \"Hey,\" I say, \"Brinhorn has spent years upon years winning every single sage tournament from the Western Continent just to get a chance to challenge Azarius for the sage title again and again, without beating him even once. And yet he still does it. Every year! If that's not pure madness, then I don't know what is. But yeah, now that I think about it, maybe Brinhorn and I were pretty likeminded after all. I'm honestly surprised that we haven't run into him so far. I would find it extremely unlikely for him to not be here, especially knowing that Azarius joined this tournament. Maybe he got teleported to the other end of the continent or something.\"<br/>\"Have you not kept in contact with him at all since you left?\" Daren asks me. \"If you at least had the frequency of his transceiver, we could try to call him.\"<br/><br/> \"Nah,\" I say. \"It's been years since I last talked to him. I don't even know if he'd still be using the same transceiver or not. I've thought about sending him a letter once or twice, but I always kind of put it off for another time, telling myself that I'd rather give him the good news of having found a way to become a mage rather than contacting him after such a long time just to tell him of my failure. I wonder how he would react if he saw me casting magic now...\"<br/>\"I'm sure he'd be proud,\" Daren says. \"Maybe he'd even find some more motivation for working harder on his own unachievable goal. If something as impossible as a regular person casting magic can be done, then beating Azarius should seem like a piece of cake in comparison.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I guess you could put it that way!\" I say.<br/><br/>",

Still, this is a much, much better situation for us than the one we were in a week ago. At least now we know that the prize we were looking for exists, and there is a way to use it. As long as we know it can be used, we'll find some way to access it, with or without Meridith's help.\"<br/>\"I like your spirit!\" Daren says. \"Yes, I was thinking the same thing. Maybe we should ask Arraka or Illuna if they know the locations of any other Magium nodes. They definitely seemed like they interacted with at least one of them before, so there has to be some way to get to them.\"<br/><br/>\"Absolutely!\" I say. \"We'll ask them first thing in the morning. And with that said, I think it might be time to go wake up Kate and Diane so they can begin the second night shift. I could use some sleep!\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, then,\" Daren says. \"Let's gather up these playing cards first, and then we can go.\"<br/><br/>After we put all of the cards back in the deck, we wake up Kate and Diane, and we go directly to our tents, so we can at least get a few hours of uninterrupted sleep for the night. The next morning, we are awakened by the very distinct smell of roasted wyvern, which should normally be a delicacy served only to royalty, but Flower seems to have no trouble conjuring it in large quantities without expending too much energy. <br/><br/> As most of us are slowly being lured towards Flower by the appetizing aroma, we hear Daren having a conversation with his wife, Sophie, on his transceiver while packing his tent. They've been talking at least three times per day since he managed to finally contact her, which is nice to see, since it's clear how much they've missed each other. What's more, Sophie has also blended rather well with our group, and she has already made some plans to join us on a few journeys after we are done with the tournament.<br/>Aside from Daren's wife, we've also been in contact with Melindra and with Leila's father, who both have transceivers from Daren and can call us whenever they like. Unfortunately, since Leila can't send her texts through the transceiver, her father needs to read them out loud for us, which makes our discussions a little awkward, but at least we can communicate with her, so I can't complain. As for Melindra, Flower tends to call her more than ten times a day, so in a way, it's like she never left. I've also seen Kate call her a few times, but she mostly does it in secret, while she is training, probably because she is too embarrassed to let us know that she misses her.<br/><br/> One other, more unusual conversation partner that we've been talking to on a semi-regular basis since we left the lessathi base is Jirinn, the spirit in the magical plane that Daren is linked with. Well, actually, he mostly only talks with Arraka, and barely acknowledges our presence, but even so, he has been giving us some very interesting information about the latest developments on the magical plane. Apparently, Arraka's plan worked far better than we could have hoped, and now most of the gods have turned against the God of Time, the God of Death and the God of Fate. <br/>Also, now that the other denizens of the magical plane found out that some of the gods had been absorbing spirits to increase their powers in secret, many of them have started volunteering to join Jirinn's enlightened warriors group and according to him, they should soon have enough members to pose an actual threat to the divided and weakened gods.<br/><br/>However, as Arraka predicted, the three rogue gods have been holding out quite well against all the other gods, and they are giving no signs of losing this battle anytime soon. In fact, from what I understood, nobody has managed to even find the three gods for the past three days, probably because of the God of Fate's illusions that are doing a very good job at keeping them hidden and disorienting their foes. Still, this is very good news for us, because we want the God of Time to be as distracted and weakened as possible when we fight him, if we want to have any realistic chance of success.<br/><br/>",

If I stop doing it at any time, it will be extremely difficult to 'turn it back on', and with the way Eiden likes to pop in unannounced with his continent-wide teleportation, that is a risk I can't afford to take!\"<br/><br/> \"Well, it's not like anyone else here knows how to use this aura obscuring technique,\" Illuna says, \"so I suppose that we'll have to take your word on that, won't we?\"<br/>\"Listen, I realize that you've only known me for a short while,\" Diane says, \"and you have no real reason to trust me aside from the fact that I'm a childhood friend of Kate, but there really is nothing I can do about this. I'm sorry if it's making you uncomfortable...\"<br/><br/>\"I will admit that I did think something was different about you ever since we first got reunited,\" Kate says, \"but now I realize that this must have been what was bothering me. While it does feel a bit awkward having conversations with you because of it, I don't think anyone would mind it even if it wasn't something beyond your control. I'm sure that everyone would choose to constantly use a technique that makes them immune to lie-detection if they had the means to do so. Isn't that right, guys?\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, yeah, totally,\" Hadrik says, as he takes another bite of roasted wyvern.<br/>\"I suppose...\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Thank you for saying this, Kate,\" Diane says. \"I really appreciate it!\"<br/><br/>",

I've been having a headache all morning because of the hangover.\"<br/><br/>\"But why today of all days?\" Daren asks. \"Is there some special occasion?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" Hadrik says. \"The special occasion of Barry having tested a dizziness spell on me yesterday. I don't know if it's an allergic reaction or something, but there are certain dizziness spells that can cause me to become nauseous at the mere smell of any type of alcohol. The effects usually tend to truly set in the next day after the spell has been cast on me, and they normally last until late in the evening.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, damn...\" I say. \"Sorry about that. I would have chosen a different type of spell if I had known that this was such a problem for you.\"<br/><br/>\"It's fine,\" Hadrik says. \"I never really bothered telling anyone about this, so there would have been no way for you to know. Anyway, Daren, since I can't drink today, would you mind having a short sparring session with me so I can at least unload some of my frustration? We'll try to end it when Illuna is done practicing her spell with Arraka.\"<br/><br/> \"Sure thing,\" Daren says. \"Let's go over there, and we can start right away.\"<br/>As soon as Daren and Hadrik move away from the rest of us and get into their positions, they both count to three at the same time and then they dash at each other almost immediately. However, not even thirty seconds after the start of the battle, Daren calls for an unexpected time-out.<br/><br/>\"Stop, stop, stop!\" Daren shouts all of a sudden. \"Hadrik, what in the gods' names are you doing?\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean what am I doing?...\" Hadrik says. \"I'm fighting. You've seen me fight dozens of times before.\"<br/><br/>\"Not like this!\" Daren says. \"Your moves are not the same at all! It's like you've become a completely different person overnight! How in the world could you have changed your fighting style so much over the course of one day? I couldn't even predict half of those moves and I was reading your aura every step of the way!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah,\" Hadrik says. \"Now that I think about it, people HAVE told me in the past that I fight a little better when I'm not drunk. I suppose it's been so long since I've been sober that I simply forgot.\"<br/><br/> \"Hadrik, my friend...\" Daren says. \"This fighting style of yours isn't just a little better, it's a huge improvement! I could barely wrap my head around it, and I've seen you fight countless times. If you already know that you can fight so much better without drinking, then why not just take a break from alcohol until the tournament is over? Don't you want to be at your strongest when fighting your opponents?\"<br/>\"Hmm...\" Hadrik says. \"How am I going to explain this to you in a way that makes sense?... You see, to me, drinking alcohol is like breathing air. If someone were to come to you now and tell you that you could fight ten times better if you stopped breathing, would you do it?\"<br/><br/>\"I suppose I should have known that you'd say something like this,\" Daren says. \"Never mind. Forget that I even asked. Illuna are you done with those dishes yet?\"<br/><br/>\"Almost,\" Illuna says. \"These two are the last ones.\"<br/><br/>",
