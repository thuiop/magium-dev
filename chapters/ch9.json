Flower is leading the way again, but this time she looks a lot less confident than before, and there's definitely some uneasiness in her voice as she speaks to us.<br/><br/>\"Okay, so we'll need to follow this path for the next few hours, until we reach the first crossroads,\" the girl says. \"After that, there isn't really a path to follow anymore, so you're going to have to stick close to me if you don't want to get lost. If you want to take food breaks, just tell me and we'll--\"<br/><br/>\"Flower,\" Kate interrupts her. \"Why did you agree to come with us to the ogre stronghold? Isn't it a little dangerous even for you to be heading straight into monster territory like this?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, yeah, but if I didn't agree to come with you, Eleya would have killed you...\"<br/><br/>\"So what?\" Kate asks. \"If the fox killed us, then our blood wouldn't have been on your hands. Why would you go so far out of your way to help a group of complete strangers? Why not just let her kill us and go on about your business?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know... I just... couldn't...\"<br/><br/>Kate looks at her for a few seconds, and then she smiles faintly.<br/><br/>\"I see...\" she says. \"Flower, I believe we may have started off on the wrong foot this morning. Allow me to rectify that.\"<br/><br/> She then holds out her hand to her, and says:<br/>\"My name is Kate. Pleased to meet you!\"<br/><br/>Flower looks somewhat taken aback by Kate's sudden shift in attitude towards her, and she shakes her hand, hesitantly.<br/><br/>\"And my name is Rose!\" Rose says, as she offers her hand as well. \"I'm glad to have you with us, Flower!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm Hadrik,\" says Hadrik. \"But you can just call me 'dwarf'. Either name will do!\"<br/><br/>Flower takes a few steps back and is now starting to panic.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry!\" she says. \"I've never really been accepted into a group before. I have no idea what you're supposed to say in these situations!\"<br/><br/>\"It's okay, Flower,\" Kate says. \"You don't need to say anything.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Flower says, as she starts to calm down. \"Well, that's a relief!\"<br/><br/>",

Or at least the books that they were kind enough to have translated in the common language. Getting back to the subject at hand, the ethereals are different from other humans, because they experience life from the perspective of their souls, instead of their bodies. Imagine living your whole life inside a giant puppet, unable to get out, forced to use it every time you need to interact with a person from the outside world.\"<br/><br/> \"I sometimes pretend that I use invisible strings to control my body!\" Flower says. \"It makes life in here a little more bearable.\"<br/>\"Most children will instinctively realize that something is different about ethereals,\" Kate continues, \"so they will usually isolate them from a very young age and not accept them in their groups. Being left alone both in their mind and in the outside world, ethereals are forced to find their own ways to cope with their situation. Some of them will simply start shutting the whole world out, and isolate themselves even further. Others will make titanic efforts to integrate themselves in society, but the social awkwardness that they gained from years of isolation will always stand in their way. Living their lives alone in their own minds also causes many ethereals to develop eccentric personalities and to fixate on a hobby they like until they become exceptionally skilled at it. Diane used to love tinkering with complex devices for hours on end. Flower, I assume that your chosen hobby would be acrobacy?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yes!\" Flower says. \"I absolutely love it! I used to be in a circus when I was little, and since then there's rarely been a day when I've neglected to train my acrobatic skills!\"<br/><br/>",

Petal always told me that I am learning magic at a much faster rate than should be humanly possible. Is this because I'm an ethereal too?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes! The ethereal plane is closer in nature to the magical plane than the earthen plane is. For this reason, your unique perspective allows you to understand magic much more naturally than the rest of us. Being an ethereal does not grant you magical powers upon birth, but those that are also born as mages are fated to become extremely powerful. This is why the lessathi from the Beacon of Hope made it their mission to capture as many ethereal orphans as possible, in the hopes that their experiments would have a greater chance of success. My friend Diane and her brother were both ethereals, and they turned out to be quite the prodigies.\"<br/><br/>\"I think I'm finally starting to understand why Petal was so surprised to find me inside my own mind when she first awakened,\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"If I were to venture a guess,\" Kate says, \"I'd say that your unexpected fusion with the banshee's soul also came as a result of your rather unique circumstances.

She's taught me a lot of survival tips that have come in handy along the years. Would you like me to share some of them with you?\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, I suppose it couldn't hurt...\"<br/><br/>\"Great!\" Flower says, as her cheerful smile returns to her face once again. \"I'll try to remember everything I know on the way to the ogre stronghold.

During this time, Daren and Hadrik started a bit of a competition to see which one of them could tell the most interesting story from their adventures, while Kate and Flower started sharing their similar life experiences with each other, which seemed to bring them a little closer together.<br/>Once we reached the crossroads, around noon, we all stopped in our tracks, and Daren started addressing Rose, with a serious look on his face:<br/><br/>\"Rose, I think you should take this path and head to your hometown as soon as possible. Don't worry about us and the collars. We'll be fine! The sick people in your town are all waiting for you!\"<br/><br/>\"She can't leave...\" Kate says. \"Remember what the leopard told us before we left? If any two of the collars get further away than three miles from each other, then all of us will start to get electrical shocks of increasing intensity surging throughout our bodies. If the collars get more than four miles away from each other, then we'll all get killed. The lessathi were the ones who originally designed these devices, and this was a measure they took to keep their prisoners in check. Rose, I'm so sorry... I did not know it would come to this. I should have tried to stop you when you offered to come with me yesterday. This is all my fault...\"<br/><br/> \"Kate, you had no way of knowing this would happen,\" Rose says. \"Even with this detour, I'll still arrive ahead of my original schedule, as long as we keep following the direct route we've been using up until now. There's no need to apologize for any of this. We're friends, remember?\"<br/>Not knowing exactly how to answer, Kate simply nods to her, and we all decide to take a small break to eat some food, because we haven't really eaten much since our imprisonment. After I finish my meal, I notice that Flower, who wasn't particularly hungry, had decided to make use of this time to practice her fire magic, by shooting fireballs at various rocks lying on the side of the road. <br/><br/>\"You sure do like to train, huh?\" I ask Flower as I approach her.<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, I'm not training right now,\" she says. \"I just like to blow stuff up!\"<br/><br/>\"How old did you say you were, again?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm almost thirty!\"<br/><br/>",

After what you've told me, Kate, I'm willing to bet that this stillwater Arraka fused with was an ethereal as well!\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on,\" I tell her. \"Can banshees possess male hosts?

I assume that a spirit as powerful as Arraka has no need to take such precautions.\"<br/><br/> \"That's right,\" Flower says. \"Arraka was so powerful, in fact, that it took the combined effort of Eleya and the Creator to put a stop to her rampage.\"<br/>\"The Creator is that guy who is considered to be the founder of Varathia's current civilization, right?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, that's him,\" Flower says. \"So, as I was saying, the Creator and the fox managed to defeat Arraka, but only temporarily. Even they weren't powerful enough to kill her outright, but they managed to cast a very complex spell on her, which forbids her to possess any of the humanoid races. For the next six hundred years, she was forced to possess only animals, which are too weak for her to be able to use her full powers.\"<br/><br/>\"So, if she's already been roaming free for six hundred years, why is she more of a problem now?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Because of me,\" Flower says. \"The nature of my magical aura has changed drastically since my soul has fused with Petal's, and since my aura is so different now from that of any other humans, the spell cast on Arraka cannot identify me as a human being anymore, and therefore does not prohibit her from possessing my body. Even if I were to throw Arraka somewhere far away, she'd just break out of the amulet and find her way to me sooner or later. And then it wouldn't be all over just for me and Petal, it may well be the end for the entire continent, or maybe even the world...\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" I tell her. \"You're saying that you have to keep Arraka under constant supervision, so that you can dispel her explosion spell before she fully channels it, but what happens when you sleep?\"<br/><br/>",

I understand why you might find her annoying because of that, but even though she might appear to be fooling around at times, I really think that she is taking this situation a lot more seriously than she lets on. Could you maybe give her another chance?\"<br/><br/>\"I suppose I could try...\"<br/><br/>\"Wonderful!\" Rose says, smiling. \"Oh, and don't worry, I'm not going to tell Flower what you said about her. It will be our little secret!\"<br/><br/>\"Leaving the girl aside, though, the banshee inhabiting her body is actually the one I'm more worried about.

Kate and Flower, who had just returned from their scouting mission, reported that there was no suspicious activity around our campsite and then they both took a seat on a log next to us. <br/>Once the tents have all been set, we decided to go to sleep early, in order to be well rested when we leave tomorrow, at the crack of dawn. Flower volunteered to take first watch, and then she immediately went to climb the highest hill, to get a good view of the entire valley. As she passed me by, I could sense her aura weakening considerably, and the banshee's aura becoming a lot stronger. Does this mean that the girl went to sleep and left the banshee in charge of the night shift? If that is so, then this would be the perfect opportunity to get to know the banshee a bit, before we reach the ogre stronghold tomorrow. <br/><br/>\"Aren't you going to sleep, Barry?\" Rose asks me, as she sees me just standing there.<br/><br/>",

One of these techniques allows me to harden the magical aura around my body, which is not only great for defense, but also for attacking. If I use it to harden the magical aura around my fists, I can easily deflect fireballs with my punches, and send them right back at their casters!\"<br/><br/>\"My sword is also good against elementalists,\" Daren says. \"I can use it to absorb any element, and I also have a sword technique that can temporarily sever a mage's link to the magical plane, making them unable to cast spells for thirty minutes.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Hadrik says. \"Who says mages need magic to fight? We'll conquer this stronghold of theirs in no time!\"<br/><br/> \"If we're all agreed to attack the fort openly, then I guess there's not much more to discuss,\" Daren says. \"There are too many things we don't know about the building's layout and the distribution of their troops to be able to anticipate what will happen. We'll just have to rely on our instincts, once the battle begins. If no one else has anything to add, then I suggest we get going. We still have a lot of ground to cover until we reach our objective.\"<br/>It was a few more hours later that we got close enough to the stronghold to be able to do a bit of reconnaissance. Flower and Hadrik went to scout ahead, while the rest of us looked for a good place to bury our backpacks, since it would be too difficult to fight with them on our backs and we'd have no place to leave them while we're in the fort.

Everything seems to be in order, except for one small detail that catches my attention. The grass is unusually flat right around the spot where I heard those footsteps. It's as if a force is pushing that particular patch of grass towards the ground, in the same way it would be pushed if someone were to stand on it. <br/><br/>A crazy thought occurs to me, and I aim my crossbow somewhere a few feet above the flat grass.<br/><br/>\"Barry, what are you playing at?\" Daren asks me. \"Put that crossbow down, and let's go to the fort.\" <br/><br/>I pay him no mind, and I shoot an arrow at the empty space in front of me. Instead of going through the air, however, the arrow stops in mid-flight, and a trickle of blood starts coming out from its tip. Soon afterwards, a hideous creature begins to slowly materialize in front of us, with my arrow sticking out of its big belly. The monster is about eight feet tall, with thick gray skin, and it's wearing nothing other than a loincloth around its waist. Two of its lower fangs are sticking out of its closed mouth, its forehead is exceedingly narrow, and on its face, it is wearing one of the dumbest expressions I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/><% } %>",

The whole area around the fort had been completely cleansed of trees and all other vegetation, to provide direct line of sight for the ogre patrols. The stronghold itself was placed on top of a hill, and it had a surface of around four hundred thousand square feet. Its walls were made of stone, and had a height of about thirty feet, while the only visible entrance to the fort was a very large wooden gate that had been left wide open, giving us a clear view of the stronghold's inner yard.<br/>There seemed to be one main building in the middle, which was connected to all four of the walls that formed a square around it. Getting a closer look at the fort, we soon realized that it wasn't just the walls that were deserted, but the whole yard as well. <br/><br/>\"They sure aren't trying to hide the fact that this is a trap, are they?\" Hadrik asks, as we step through their open gates.<br/><br/>\"Keep your guards up,\" Daren says, as he looks around. \"They could attack us from any direction.\"<br/><br/>While we make our way inside their inner yard, Arraka suddenly starts to make a very loud noise from inside her amulet.<br/><br/>\"Oh no, you don't!\" Flower says. \"If I open the amulet now, you're just going to shout as loud as you can and give away our position to the ogres, aren't you? You're not going to fool me again!\"<br/><br/>Arraka makes an even louder muffled sound, and she doesn't appear to have any intention of stopping.<br/><br/>",

In this case, the self-destruct mechanism in the collars will not get activated.\"<br/><br/>\"You've said enough,\" the shaman says. \"It's clear that you hold no attachment to your former allies. You are welcome to use our library as much as you please, Illuna of the sacred woods massacre. We will discuss your payment after you rid yourself of the girl. As for these humans, I have a teleportation spell that can easily transport them into their cell, as long as they don't move from their position for a while. If you confirm that you can still hold onto that cage, I will start casting it.\"<br/><br/>\"My cage will last for at least another few minutes,\" Illuna says. \"However, I have one more warning to give you. That dwarf possesses a giant's strength and could easily break through the walls of your prison without any weapons. I suggest you transport them into one of the cells that have a paralysis spell cast on them. I've visited this stronghold before, when it was owned by goblins, and I remember that there was at least one such cell on the lower levels of the main building.\"<br/><br/> \"You remember correctly, banshee,\" the shaman says. \"Very well, then. I will send them to one of the paralysis cells.\"<br/>He then starts casting his teleportation spell, and our bodies start to slowly vibrate, while we get covered in a bright white light.<br/><br/>\"You bloody traitor!\" Hadrik says, as he tries to bend the cage's bars with his bare hands. \"I can't believe you actually told them about my giant's strength!\"<br/><br/>\"Illuna, how could you do this?\" Rose asks the banshee, as a tear drops from her eye. \"I trusted you. Flower trusted you. How could you betray us all like this?\"<br/><br/>\"You are far too trusting for your own good, Rose,\" Illuna says, with a frozen look in her eyes. \"I already warned you not to consider me your ally. You should have listened to your healer when you had the chance. Now you will pay the price for your foolishness.\"<br/><br/>The banshee's cold look and Rose's tears are the last things I see before everything fades to black and we all get teleported to what may well become our final destination.<br/><br/>",
