Flower is leading the way again, but this time she looks a lot less confident than before, and there's definitely some uneasiness in her voice as she speaks to us.<br/><br/>\"Okay, so we'll need to follow this path for the next few hours, until we reach the first crossroads,\" the girl says. \"After that, there isn't really a path to follow anymore, so you're going to have to stick close to me if you don't want to get lost. If you want to take food breaks, just tell me and we'll--\"<br/><br/>\"Flower,\" Kate interrupts her. \"Why did you agree to come with us to the ogre stronghold? Isn't it a little dangerous even for you to be heading straight into monster territory like this?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, yeah, but if I didn't agree to come with you, Eleya would have killed you...\"<br/><br/>\"So what?\" Kate asks. \"If the fox killed us, then our blood wouldn't have been on your hands. Why would you go so far out of your way to help a group of complete strangers? Why not just let her kill us and go on about your business?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know... I just... couldn't...\"<br/><br/>Kate looks at her for a few seconds, and then she smiles faintly.<br/><br/>\"I see...\" she says. \"Flower, I believe we may have started off on the wrong foot this morning. Allow me to rectify that.\"<br/><br/> She then holds out her hand to her, and says:<br/>\"My name is Kate. Pleased to meet you!\"<br/><br/>Flower looks somewhat taken aback by Kate's sudden shift in attitude towards her, and she shakes her hand, hesitantly.<br/><br/>\"And my name is Rose!\" Rose says, as she offers her hand as well. \"I'm glad to have you with us, Flower!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm Hadrik,\" says Hadrik. \"But you can just call me 'dwarf'. Either name will do!\"<br/><br/>Flower takes a few steps back and is now starting to panic.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry!\" she says. \"I've never really been accepted into a group before. I have no idea what you're supposed to say in these situations!\"<br/><br/>\"It's okay, Flower,\" Kate says. \"You don't need to say anything.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Flower says, as she starts to calm down. \"Well, that's a relief!\"<br/><br/>",

People who identify with their souls, instead of their bodies.\"<br/><br/>\"Their souls?\" Rose asks.<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Kate says. \"Most people don't even know that they have a soul, because they only use their five senses to explore the world around them. However, the soul, which stores a person's memory and the very essence of their being, is actually being kept on the ethereal plane, in a pocket universe that is usually referred to as their mind. While the human brain facilitates the interaction between the soul and the body, it is not the sole actor in the creation of an individual's personality, as most scholars would have you believe. After a person dies, in the same way that their body decomposes and eventually becomes one with the earth, the person's soul also decomposes into ethereal matter and eventually becomes one with the ethereal plane once more.\"<br/>\"Hey, that's not what they taught me in giant school!\" Hadrik says. \"As far as I know, once we die, our spirits are all supposed to go to the afterlife of whatever god we worshipped during our lives on this plane!\"<br/><br/>\"Believe what you will,\" Kate tells him. \"I am merely reciting texts from old lessathi books that I was allowed to read during my time at the Beacon. Or at least the books that they were kind enough to have translated in the common language. Getting back to the subject at hand, the ethereals are different from other humans, because they experience life from the perspective of their souls, instead of their bodies. Imagine living your whole life inside a giant puppet, unable to get out, forced to use it every time you need to interact with a person from the outside world.\"<br/><br/> \"I sometimes pretend that I use invisible strings to control my body!\" Flower says. \"It makes life in here a little more bearable.\"<br/>\"Most children will instinctively realize that something is different about ethereals,\" Kate continues, \"so they will usually isolate them from a very young age and not accept them in their groups. Being left alone both in their mind and in the outside world, ethereals are forced to find their own ways to cope with their situation. Some of them will simply start shutting the whole world out, and isolate themselves even further. Others will make titanic efforts to integrate themselves in society, but the social awkwardness that they gained from years of isolation will always stand in their way. Living their lives alone in their own minds also causes many ethereals to develop eccentric personalities and to fixate on a hobby they like until they become exceptionally skilled at it. Diane used to love tinkering with complex devices for hours on end. Flower, I assume that your chosen hobby would be acrobacy?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yes!\" Flower says. \"I absolutely love it! I used to be in a circus when I was little, and since then there's rarely been a day when I've neglected to train my acrobatic skills!\"<br/><br/>",

The ethereal plane is closer in nature to the magical plane than the earthen plane is. For this reason, your unique perspective allows you to understand magic much more naturally than the rest of us. Being an ethereal does not grant you magical powers upon birth, but those that are also born as mages are fated to become extremely powerful. This is why the lessathi from the Beacon of Hope made it their mission to capture as many ethereal orphans as possible, in the hopes that their experiments would have a greater chance of success. My friend Diane and her brother were both ethereals, and they turned out to be quite the prodigies.\"<br/><br/>\"I think I'm finally starting to understand why Petal was so surprised to find me inside my own mind when she first awakened,\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"If I were to venture a guess,\" Kate says, \"I'd say that your unexpected fusion with the banshee's soul also came as a result of your rather unique circumstances.

During this time, Daren and Hadrik started a bit of a competition to see which one of them could tell the most interesting story from their adventures, while Kate and Flower started sharing their similar life experiences with each other, which seemed to bring them a little closer together.<br/>Once we reached the crossroads, around noon, we all stopped in our tracks, and Daren started addressing Rose, with a serious look on his face:<br/><br/>\"Rose, I think you should take this path and head to your hometown as soon as possible. Don't worry about us and the collars. We'll be fine! The sick people in your town are all waiting for you!\"<br/><br/>\"She can't leave...\" Kate says. \"Remember what the leopard told us before we left? If any two of the collars get further away than three miles from each other, then all of us will start to get electrical shocks of increasing intensity surging throughout our bodies. If the collars get more than four miles away from each other, then we'll all get killed. The lessathi were the ones who originally designed these devices, and this was a measure they took to keep their prisoners in check. Rose, I'm so sorry... I did not know it would come to this. I should have tried to stop you when you offered to come with me yesterday. This is all my fault...\"<br/><br/> \"Kate, you had no way of knowing this would happen,\" Rose says. \"Even with this detour, I'll still arrive ahead of my original schedule, as long as we keep following the direct route we've been using up until now. There's no need to apologize for any of this. We're friends, remember?\"<br/>Not knowing exactly how to answer, Kate simply nods to her, and we all decide to take a small break to eat some food, because we haven't really eaten much since our imprisonment. After I finish my meal, I notice that Flower, who wasn't particularly hungry, had decided to make use of this time to practice her fire magic, by shooting fireballs at various rocks lying on the side of the road. <br/><br/>\"You sure do like to train, huh?\" I ask Flower as I approach her.<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, I'm not training right now,\" she says. \"I just like to blow stuff up!\"<br/><br/>\"How old did you say you were, again?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm almost thirty!\"<br/><br/>",

From what I hear, our two cases are the only two occurrences of soul fusion in our history. After what you've told me, Kate, I'm willing to bet that this stillwater Arraka fused with was an ethereal as well!\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on,\" I tell her. \"Can banshees possess male hosts?

I assume that a spirit as powerful as Arraka has no need to take such precautions.\"<br/><br/> \"That's right,\" Flower says. \"Arraka was so powerful, in fact, that it took the combined effort of Eleya and the Creator to put a stop to her rampage.\"<br/>\"The Creator is that guy who is considered to be the founder of Varathia's current civilization, right?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, that's him,\" Flower says. \"So, as I was saying, the Creator and the fox managed to defeat Arraka, but only temporarily. Even they weren't powerful enough to kill her outright, but they managed to cast a very complex spell on her, which forbids her to possess any of the humanoid races. For the next six hundred years, she was forced to possess only animals, which are too weak for her to be able to use her full powers.\"<br/><br/>\"So, if she's already been roaming free for six hundred years, why is she more of a problem now?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Because of me,\" Flower says. \"The nature of my magical aura has changed drastically since my soul has fused with Petal's, and since my aura is so different now from that of any other humans, the spell cast on Arraka cannot identify me as a human being anymore, and therefore does not prohibit her from possessing my body. Even if I were to throw Arraka somewhere far away, she'd just break out of the amulet and find her way to me sooner or later. And then it wouldn't be all over just for me and Petal, it may well be the end for the entire continent, or maybe even the world...\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" I tell her. \"You're saying that you have to keep Arraka under constant supervision, so that you can dispel her explosion spell before she fully channels it, but what happens when you sleep?\"<br/><br/>",

Flower volunteered to take first watch, and then she immediately went to climb the highest hill, to get a good view of the entire valley. As she passed me by, I could sense her aura weakening considerably, and the banshee's aura becoming a lot stronger. Does this mean that the girl went to sleep and left the banshee in charge of the night shift? If that is so, then this would be the perfect opportunity to get to know the banshee a bit, before we reach the ogre stronghold tomorrow. <br/><br/>\"Aren't you going to sleep, Barry?\" Rose asks me, as she sees me just standing there.<br/><br/>",

Everything seems to be in order, except for one small detail that catches my attention. The grass is unusually flat right around the spot where I heard those footsteps. It's as if a force is pushing that particular patch of grass towards the ground, in the same way it would be pushed if someone were to stand on it. <br/><br/>A crazy thought occurs to me, and I aim my crossbow somewhere a few feet above the flat grass.<br/><br/>\"Barry, what are you playing at?\" Daren asks me. \"Put that crossbow down, and let's go to the fort.\" <br/><br/>I pay him no mind, and I shoot an arrow at the empty space in front of me. Instead of going through the air, however, the arrow stops in mid-flight, and a trickle of blood starts coming out from its tip. Soon afterwards, a hideous creature begins to slowly materialize in front of us, with my arrow sticking out of its big belly. The monster is about eight feet tall, with thick gray skin, and it's wearing nothing other than a loincloth around its waist. Two of its lower fangs are sticking out of its closed mouth, its forehead is exceedingly narrow, and on its face, it is wearing one of the dumbest expressions I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/><% } %>",

The whole area around the fort had been completely cleansed of trees and all other vegetation, to provide direct line of sight for the ogre patrols. The stronghold itself was placed on top of a hill, and it had a surface of around four hundred thousand square feet. Its walls were made of stone, and had a height of about thirty feet, while the only visible entrance to the fort was a very large wooden gate that had been left wide open, giving us a clear view of the stronghold's inner yard.<br/>There seemed to be one main building in the middle, which was connected to all four of the walls that formed a square around it. Getting a closer look at the fort, we soon realized that it wasn't just the walls that were deserted, but the whole yard as well. <br/><br/>\"They sure aren't trying to hide the fact that this is a trap, are they?\" Hadrik asks, as we step through their open gates.<br/><br/>\"Keep your guards up,\" Daren says, as he looks around. \"They could attack us from any direction.\"<br/><br/>While we make our way inside their inner yard, Arraka suddenly starts to make a very loud noise from inside her amulet.<br/><br/>\"Oh no, you don't!\" Flower says. \"If I open the amulet now, you're just going to shout as loud as you can and give away our position to the ogres, aren't you? You're not going to fool me again!\"<br/><br/>Arraka makes an even louder muffled sound, and she doesn't appear to have any intention of stopping.<br/><br/>",
