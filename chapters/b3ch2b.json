        "text": " \"Were the buildings in this city always so weird?\" I ask Melindra. \"I'm honestly surprised that some of these structures haven't collapsed, yet.\"<br/>\"There were houses like this in the city before I was kicked out, but not as many as there are now,\" Melindra says. \"They must have demolished some of the older houses in order to build the new ones on top of them. It's probably the work of Billy Bob, the rogue lessathi that I was telling you about earlier. He kind of fancies himself a genius in every domain, including architecture, and the king has been giving him a lot of liberties, as a reward for his invaluable contributions towards this city's sudden and abrupt technological advancement. As a result, old Billy Bob has taken the opportunity of experimenting with all kinds of wild and innovative designs for buildings, some of which are a little more questionable than others.\"<br/><br/>\"Excuse me, but did you just say this lessathi's name is Billy Bob?...\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Oh, that's not his real name,\" Melindra says. \"That's just what we used to call him because his name was nearly unpronounceable. His full name is Biliborrathrathsarran, and since the first few syllables kind of sound like Billy Bob, that's the nickname he ended up with.\"<br/><br/>\"I guess his parents really went all out when they named him, huh?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/> \"Honestly, it doesn't sound that much more ridiculous than your typical lessathi name, to me,\" Melindra says. \"It's just the length of it that's really exaggerated. There were just so many ways in which they could have shortened the name to turn it into something more manageable, that it makes me think his parents simply named him like that as a cruel joke. What better way to ruin your son's life than to give him a name that-- hey look, a flying golem head!\"<br/>\"What?...\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"Over there, look!\" Melindra says, as she points towards a strange contraption that is currently flying towards us.<br/><br/>This 'flying golem head' seems to be nothing more than a metal ball the size of a human head, with a propeller on top and a sort of large eye in the center, which appears to be illuminated by a red light. As the flying metal ball gets closer to us, it turns itself left and right, so that its eye can get a good look at us, and then it begins speaking in a metallic-sounding monotone voice.<br/><br/>\"This unit does not recognize you,\" the flying ball says. \"Identify yourselves.\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, this brings back so many memories!\" Melindra says, as she looks at the metal ball in front of her. \"I remember how Billy Bob had an obsession with these one-eyed golem heads. He wanted to make them intelligent! I believe he used to call them... droons? Yeah, I think that was the name. Anyway, so Billy Bob had this dream that he could one day fill the skies with these 'droons' of his, and that they would somehow monitor the citizens even in the absence of the city guards. Needless to say, his dream remained only a dream, and the most he managed to get out of these old relics was to get them to ask for your name. If you don't answer them, they'll keep pestering you until you tell them something. But if you give them any name whatsoever, they'll simply fly away and leave you alone. How's that for a useless invention?\"<br/>\"This unit shall not repeat itself again,\" the flying metal ball says. \"Identify yourselves, or face the consequences!\"<br/><br/>",

On the screen, we see a fat man with a gray beard wearing a crown and royal garments who I'm assuming is the king of Ollendor, a man wearing blue robes holding a scepter who is likely the city's high priest, serving the God of the Seas, and an eighteen year old boy wearing pajamas, holding his hands in his pockets and keeping his eyes closed, while having a polite smile on his face.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Daren says, as he takes a look at the screen. \"Not him again...\"<br/><br/>As if he'd heard him commenting, Eiden looks straight at Daren through the screen with his eyes still closed, and he smirks at him.<br/><br/> \"Did you see that?\" Daren says in a low voice, so the other people in the plaza won't hear him. \"He was looking right at me when he smirked! How did he hear what I said? Do you think they are somewhere nearby?\"<br/>\"Be serious...\" Arraka tells Daren. \"He didn't need to hear exactly which words you used to figure out what you were going to say. You say the same thing every time Eiden makes an appearance. All he had to do was use his magical sense to figure out where you were situated in relation to the screen, and then read the fluctuations in your aura to figure out when you were done talking, so he could smirk at you. You would know these sorts of things if those 'ex-sage' teachers of yours had spent a minimum amount of time giving you aura training exercises instead of teaching you how to pick daisies.\"<br/><br/>\"I swear,\" Melindra says, \"if Eiden is planning to give away our position to the king after he didn't even bother to say hello to me at the arena in Thilias, I am going to strangle him with my own hands.\"<br/><br/> \"He's not giving away anything,\" Illuna says. \"Look at the screen. They're clearly preparing for a ceremony of some kind. The king and Eiden are both staying silent, while the man in robes is chanting obscure mantras and smacking the ground repeatedly with his scepter. I recommend that we ignore them and keep following Melindra towards our destination. This ceremony of theirs is probably going to take a long time.\"<br/>\"Yes, well, you see...\" Melindra says. \"The thing is that it's been a while since I last visited this plaza, and I don't really remember which way we're supposed to go from here. They've changed so many things with the architecture that nothing looks the same anymore, and it's all very confusing. Just... give me a minute, and I'm sure I'll figure it out.\"<br/><br/>",

Maybe all those aura training sessions weren't a complete waste of time after all.\"<br/>\"Some of our escape routes only have a few sentries posted at the exits,\" Melindra says. \"We should be able to overpower them easily.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, but then they'll announce our position to all of their friends, and they'll come right after us,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Still better than to be caught in an ambush,\" Melindra says. \"We're invading a city here... We can't exactly expect to not encounter any resistance.\"<br/><br/>\"I suppose not,\" Daren says. \"Alright, let's take the most direct path to the palace that avoids the ambush, then. Which way do we go?\"<br/><br/>\"This way,\" Melindra says, as she heads down a small deserted alleyway. \"Follow me.\"<br/><br/>It doesn't take us long to find the two guards stationed at the end of the alley, and to see that one of them has a transceiver in his hand. We incapacitate the two of them quickly and we move on ahead, hoping that they didn't get the time to notify their friends of our position before we knocked them out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we soon find out that we might have been a bit too optimistic, as the guards that were setting up the ambush earlier are all now running towards us, and at this rate, it should not take them too long to reach our position.<br/><br/> \"What now?\" Hadrik says. \"Do we stand here and fight them?\"<br/>\"No,\" Daren says. \"We'll try to delay them as much as we can. Flower, can you cast a wall of fire that is long enough to cover the width of this street? It should take them a while to find a way around it, and that will give us a bit of time to distance ourselves from them.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, sure,\" Flower says, as she conjures a wall of flames behind us, just like Daren said.<br/><br/>\"Perfect!\" Daren says. \"Let's keep going.\"<br/><br/>\"There's still another group of guards approaching us from that other alleyway over there...\" Melindra says, as she points towards the entrance of an alleyway that intersects with the one that we're currently on.<br/><br/>Before anyone gets to comment anything, Kate heads over to the alleyway Melindra mentioned, and she shoots a beam of ice out of her hands, freezing the ground completely.<br/><br/>\"There,\" Kate says. \"The ground is frozen solid. Unless they've brought ice skates with them, it's going to take them a long while to traverse this passageway. Shall we move forward?\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" Melindra says. \"We'll be reaching the Perrelion plaza soon. Once we're there, we'll decide which path to take towards the palace.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " Just like Melindra said, it didn't take too much time for us to get to the Perrelion plaza, and as soon as we reached our destination, we realized that there were quite a lot of people gathered up there, standing in place, as if they were all waiting for something.<br/>\"Do you guys think there's some sort of spectacle scheduled around this time?\" I tell my friends as we make our way through the crowd.<br/><br/>\"Could be,\" Daren says. \"They may also be waiting for some high ranking official to give a speech at this hour. Whatever it is, it shouldn't really concern us. Let's keep moving.\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a very large magical holographic screen appears in front of the crowd, floating a few dozen feet above the ground, so that everyone can see it properly. On the screen, we see a fat man with a gray beard wearing a crown and royal garments who I'm assuming is the king of Ollendor, a man wearing blue robes holding a scepter who is likely the city's high priest, serving the God of the Seas, and an eighteen year old boy wearing pajamas, holding his hands in his pockets and keeping his eyes closed, while having a polite smile on his face.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Daren says, as he takes a look at the screen. \"Not him again...\"<br/><br/>As if he'd heard him commenting, Eiden looks straight at Daren through the screen with his eyes still closed, and he smirks at him.<br/><br/> \"Did you see that?\" Daren says in a low voice, so the other people in the plaza won't hear him. \"He was looking right at me when he smirked! How did he hear what I said? Do you think they are somewhere nearby?\"<br/>\"Be serious...\" Arraka tells Daren. \"He didn't need to hear exactly which words you used to figure out what you were going to say. You say the same thing every time Eiden makes an appearance. All he had to do was use his magical sense to figure out where you were situated in relation to the screen, and then read the fluctuations in your aura to figure out when you were done talking, so he could smirk at you. You would know these sorts of things if those 'ex-sage' teachers of yours had spent a minimum amount of time giving you aura training exercises instead of teaching you how to pick daisies.\"<br/><br/>\"I swear,\" Melindra says, \"if Eiden is planning to give away our position to the king after he didn't even bother to say hello to me at the arena in Thilias, I am going to strangle him with my own hands.\"<br/><br/> \"He's not giving away anything,\" Illuna says. \"Look at the screen. They're clearly preparing for a ceremony of some kind. The king and Eiden are both staying silent, while the man in robes is chanting obscure mantras and smacking the ground repeatedly with his scepter. I recommend that we ignore them and keep following Melindra towards our destination. This ceremony of theirs is probably going to take a long time.\"<br/>\"Yes, well, you see...\" Melindra says. \"The thing is that it's been a while since I last visited this plaza, and I don't really remember which way we're supposed to go from here. They've changed so many things with the architecture that nothing looks the same anymore, and it's all very confusing. Just... give me a minute, and I'm sure I'll figure it out.\"<br/><br/>",

Hadrik instinctively jumps back, and away from our group, but Gontrok goes right after him, and he attempts to punch him in the stomach with his left fist. Hadrik immediately tries to block the hit, but it turns out to be a feint, which Gontrok used to force his opponent to leave his upper half undefended. The giant immediately seizes the opportunity, and he grabs Hadrik by the head with his right hand, smashing his face against the ground with so much strength that the impact creates a small crater and sends pieces of rock flying in all directions.<br/>Gontrok does not wait for Hadrik to recover, and while he is still firmly gripping his head in his hand, he throws the dwarf into the air, waiting for him to fall back down, and then he kicks him so hard that he sends him crashing through ten rows of houses, launching him so far away from us that we can't even see him anymore. Seeing the fight that has broken out right next to them, a lot of the citizens that were surrounding us are now running away, screaming in terror.<br/><br/> In the meantime, Kate has already begun attacking the captain, sending around a hundred icicles in his direction, but all of them stop in mid-air just as they reach him, then they turn themselves around and launch themselves right back at their creator, with breathtaking speed. Kate manages to conjure a wall of ice in front of her fast enough to defend herself from the incoming barrage of icicles, but the captain then makes a quick motion with his right hand, and somehow, an invisible force suddenly pushes Kate to the ground, restricting all her movements, similarly to how Eiden and the God of Time immobilized us during our first encounters with them.<br/>Flower tries flying upwards with her fire jets, but the invisible force pushes her down as well, and it keeps crushing her against the ground, completely immobilizing her. Before the captain gets to do anything else, however, Leila dashes towards him, forcing the old man into close-quarters combat, which is quite clearly not one of his specialties. Unable to dodge Leila's relentless attacks, the captain is forced to repel her with the same invisible force attacks that he used before, although this apparently causes him to lose his grip on the spells that were holding Kate and Flower down, which allows them to somewhat raise themselves from the ground and to start working on a counter-attack.<br/><br/> As everyone else is fighting, the dark-skinned guard stays true to his word, and he only watches everyone from afar, leaning against a wall with his arms crossed and with a rather unimpressed look on his face. Gontrok, on the other hand, is now slowly approaching Daren and me, while Hadrik is still nowhere to be found.<br/>\"Stay behind me, Barry,\" Daren says, as he raises his shield up.<br/><br/>\"Hey, I know you!\" Gontrok says. \"You're the healer in armor. Wow, this is great! I've always wanted to test my skills against a world-renowned hero. Let's see how well those legends will hold up against the might of a real warrior, shall we?\"<br/><br/>He then runs towards Daren, and he attempts to punch him directly, but the healer in armor anticipates his movements and steps to the side, letting the giant punch only empty air. Before Gontrok regains his footing, Daren quickly counter-attacks with a well-timed slash of his blade, although it seems that he wasn't fast enough, and somehow his adversary still had enough time to make a big jump backwards, and to get away unharmed.<br/><br/>\"That's not half-bad!\" Gontrok says, as Daren rushes towards him. \"But it's going to take more than that to defeat a giant.\"<br/><br/>",

So long as I never attack him, I'm not giving him any openings to exploit, and so he is forced to play this waiting game with me, unless I make a mistake.<br/>As I finally manage to distance myself a little more from him, I suddenly feel a very powerful invisible force pushing me to the ground, while restricting most of my movements.

It barely took me more than a second to dash towards Daren's sword, pick it up and then make a beeline for the giant with my weapon pointing towards him, but somehow he was still able to react in time and step to the side, just as I was about to run him through with my blade. Gontrok doesn't let me regain my footing and he immediately grabs me by my right arm, squeezing it very hard.<br/><br/>\"It's not nice to attack people while they have their backs turned to you...\" Gontrok says, with a dark look on his face, as he now squeezes my arm even harder, in an attempt to make me drop the sword. \"Maybe I should teach you a lesson, by making sure you will never be able to use this arm again.\"<br/><br/>The pain of him trying to crush my arm is excruciating, but I can easily tell that my bones would have been completely broken by now, if my toughness level weren't so high. I clench my teeth and I spin around, kicking Gontrok in the gut with the back of my left heel, which makes him lose his grip on my arm and sends him flying about a dozen feet backwards, before he lands on his back.<br/><br/> I immediately dash towards him and try to stab him while he's still lying on the ground, but the giant quickly rolls to the side, dodging my sword by a mere few inches. He then gets back up and lunges at me, in an attempt to grab me one more time, but I do a little spin and then try to stab him once again, which forces him to do a quick jump backwards, only to come back and attack me even more relentlessly one second later. I decide to take advantage of my high speed to confuse my enemy, and I attempt to distance myself from the giant, in order to run circles around him until he can no longer focus on me properly.<br/>As soon as I try to put my plan into action, however, I immediately realize that Gontrok is in fact just as fast as I am, if not even more so. Every time I try to jump away from him, he closes the gap between us in an instant, and it is only thanks to my incredible reflexes and extensive knowledge of combat techniques that I am able to both react in time and predict his next movements, in order to get out of his way in time. The two of us jump around the battlefield for a good few seconds before I conclude that this strategy isn't going to work, and as soon as I find a bit of an opening, I soar high into the air, in the hopes that I'll be able to finally get the better of him by taking advantage of my aerial superiority.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, the giant does not let me distance myself from him more than a few dozen feet before he spontaneously sprouts two dragon-like wings from his back, which he immediately uses to propel himself upwards at an alarming speed.<br/><br/> Damn it... He only partially shapeshifted himself in order to keep his giant's strength and durability, while taking advantage of a wyvern's high mobility. I didn't even know such a thing was possible. So much for my aerial superiority, I guess...<br/>What follows is an intense battle of wits and aerial maneuvering, as each one of us tries to get the upper hand on their adversary by attempting to anticipate their movements. Once again, it seems that my piloting skills are paying off, because for the most part, I appear to be the one driving Gontrok into a corner and not the other way around. That being said, I still can't seem to be able to land a hit on him, and as the battle prolongs itself I am getting increasingly worried that the giant might decide to pull another trick out of his sleeve, so he can gain the upper hand yet again.<br/><br/>As I reach a somewhat lower altitude, I suddenly feel a very powerful invisible force pushing me downwards, and I soon find myself crashing into the ground, completely unable to move. While I am still trying to raise myself from the ground without any success, Gontrok lands somewhere close beside me, retracting both of his wyvern wings until they disappear completely, and he looks at his captain, with a resentful look in his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Just what exactly do you think you're doing, captain?...\" Gontrok asks.<br/><br/>I move my head a little so I can take a better look at my surroundings and I realize that while I've been fighting the giant, Leila had also been subdued and now everyone who was fighting the captain earlier is being pushed against the ground, unable to get back up.<br/><br/>",

Don't disappoint me like this... I was having such high expectations of you!\"<br/>\"Damn it, Gontrok!\" I say. \"What the hell are you doing?! Attack him now, while he's distracted!\"<br/><br/>\"What are you blabbering about?...\" Gontrok says, as he turns towards me and leaves Daren alone for a second.<br/><br/>\"The captain!\" I say. \"Did you forget all about our plan? You said we should keep the captain busy so you could finally rid yourself of him. Well, now's your chance! Your captain is more vulnerable than ever! So, what are you waiting for? Go kill him!\"<br/><br/>\"Do you really think that such a weak lie could possibly be enough to--\" Gontrok starts saying, but all of a sudden, both he and I find ourselves getting pushed to the ground by an invisible force, which makes it impossible for us to get back up.<br/><br/>As I move my head a little so I can take a better look at my surroundings, I realize that Leila, Kate and Flower have been immobilized as well, and neither of them can get back up either, no matter how hard they try.<br/><br/>\"Just what the hell do you think you're doing, you moron?...\" Gontrok says, as he struggles in vain to set himself free from his captain's spell.<br/><br/> \"Silence!\" the captain says. \"It's already difficult enough for me to focus on immobilizing everyone without having to figure out whether you're actually trying to betray me or not. Loyrang, come here and finish these intruders off, will you? I'm afraid that if I move away from this position, I might break my concentration and undo the spell.\"<br/>\"I already told you that unless the king himself orders me to do it, I'm not going to attack any of these people,\" says the dark-skinned guard, whose name is apparently Loyrang.<br/><br/>\"So, now you are working against me as well?\" the captain says.<br/><br/>\"We're not working against you, you imbecile!\" Gontrok says. \"We can't even attack any of the locals because of the tournament's protection spell. How exactly would we even go about harming you?!\"<br/><br/>\"These outsiders should be under the effects of the tournament's spell as well...\" the captain says. \"And yet, that didn't seem to stop them from attacking me.\"<br/><br/>\"You know what?\" Gontrok says. \"You're right. Maybe that tournament spell never even existed. Maybe it was all a hoax from the beginning, just to scare us into not attacking any of the civilians. In fact, I feel like testing this theory right now.\"<br/><br/> The giant then puts both his hands on the ground, and he pushes with such strength that the stones crack beneath him, while he manages to slowly raise himself up, with great difficulty. He then begins walking very slowly towards the captain, as every single one of his steps creates a small hole in the ground, due to all the pressure that is currently pushing him down.<br/>\"Just watch me!\" Gontrok shouts very loudly, as he keeps advancing towards his captain, while clearly struggling to hold himself in an upright position. \"Tournament spell or not, I am going to come over there and smash your teeth in, you arrogant son of a whore. I will show you what it means to mess with someone like-- wait did anyone else hear that?...\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Gontrok turns to his right, putting his hands in front of him, and barely a moment later Hadrik flashes right past me, reaching his old friend in less than a second and punching him so hard that a shockwave of air hits us all in the face, when his fist collides with Gontrok's palms. Even though he did successfully block the attack, Gontrok does not manage to completely nullify the effects of the impact, and he gets thrown straight into a wall.<br/><br/>\"You sure managed to knock me out cold for a while, there, Gontrok...\" Hadrik says. \"Luckily, your loud shouts from earlier were just what I needed to get woken up!\"<br/><br/>",

That is not how we giants do battle.\"<br/><br/>\"Please tell me that you are joking...\" the captain says. \"You know what? Never mind. I don't want to hear the answer to that question.

He expanded his aura so that it would cover this whole area, and then he started crushing you with it. There's even an easily recognizable focal point floating in the air in front of you that he's using to help him control his aura fluctuations. It's right over there, look! Do you want me to color it for you?\"<br/>All of a sudden, a small sphere made of a red colored light appears in front of us, several feet above the ground.<br/><br/>\"There it is!\" Arraka says. \"Now sharpen your elements and shoot it. Shoot it!\"<br/><br/>Kate does not wait for Arraka to ask her again, and she immediately sends an ice cone straight at the red orb of light floating in the air. As soon as it is hit, the red ball of light vanishes, and I can already feel the pressure above me weakening, although it is not completely gone. Leila is the first one who manages to break herself free from the invisible force pushing her down, and she immediately starts putting pressure on the captain again, as the rest of us are still trying to get back up.<br/><br/>Just as we were about to break ourselves free as well, we feel the air becoming heavy above us, and once more, we get pushed against the ground.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Arraka says. \"He made another focal point, but he's moving it around, and I can't color it properly. This would be so much easier if you numbskulls could see it for yourselves. Well, at least the mute girl is still in the fight, so our efforts weren't completely wasted.\"<br/><br/> While Leila is fighting the captain, we can feel the invisible force above us becoming weak and then powerful again, as the old man is struggling to maintain his concentration. In the meantime, Hadrik and Gontrok are still fighting, and it looks like Gontrok is winning again, but the fight does seem to be more evenly matched this time around.<br/>As we're all still trying to raise ourselves up from the ground, we suddenly hear an explosion coming from the holographic screen, where the ceremony was still being displayed.<br/><br/>\"What was that?\" the king of Ollendor says, in a slightly panicked tone. \"Where did that explosion come from?\"<br/><br/>\"It sounded like it came from inside this very building, my lord,\" the high priest says.<br/><br/>\"By the gods!\" the king says. \"Then this must be related to the great challenge that our Creator said we would be facing soon!\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, this isn't--\" Eiden begins to say, but the king interrupts him.<br/><br/> \"Do not worry, Creator!\" the king says. \"We will show you that our kingdom is strong enough to face any danger! In fact, I will call upon my most skilled guards, so that this problem will get solved as quickly as possible. You see, I have this device here in my pocket which I am to use only in the case of an extreme emergency, and as soon as I press on this button, all of the royal guards will be teleported near my position.\"<br/>\"No...\" Gontrok says, in disbelief. \"He wouldn't!\"<br/><br/>\"Interrupt the transmission!\" the king says, as he presses on the button of his device. \"We'll have to resume the ceremony at some other time.\"<br/><br/>As the big holographic screen slowly disappears, the three royal guards are all being enveloped by a white light, which means that they are only seconds away from being teleported out of the area.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Gontrok says, as the white light surrounding him is becoming more intense. \"You stupid king! I can't believe--\"<br/><br/>Before the giant gets to finish his sentence, he and the two other guards all get teleported away from us, and as a result, the invisible force that had been pinning us to the ground finally disappears. As we get up, Hadrik begins to walk towards us, and when he approaches us we see that he is full of bruises, and that one of his cheeks is red and swollen.<br/><br/>\"So...\" Hadrik says. \"An explosion, huh?
