        "text": " Flower's discussion with Melindra continues for the next fifteen minutes or so, and of course, during this time they could not abstain themselves from including me in their conversation, as a fellow connoisseur of the sophisticated art of rock collecting. Whenever this happens, the other members of our group tend to slowly distance themselves from us while they are walking, so that they can talk about literally anything else without having to hear about rocks for the hundredth time in a row.<br/>Technically, I could be doing the same thing as them and just let Flower alone with Melindra on the transceiver, but I guess I just don't have the heart for it. Or maybe I'm just developing some sort of masochistic urge to listen to boring rock discussions whenever I have the opportunity. Who knows?<br/><br/>\"So,\" Kate says, \"does anyone else want to talk about the four mages that have been heading in our direction for a good few minutes or are we going to just keep ignoring them?\"<br/><br/> \"The last few groups that we've sensed for the past two days have always avoided us eventually,\" Daren says. \"So far there's no reason to think that they won't do the same.\"<br/>\"It's different this time,\" Kate says. \"They clearly sensed us too, and are moving to intercept us. If we keep walking at this speed, it will only take a few minutes until we come face to face with them.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, I don't want to be distracting you, so I'll leave you guys to it,\" Melindra says, from the transceiver. \"Stay safe, Flower!\"<br/><br/>\"You too,Melindra,\" Flower says. \"Bye!\"<br/><br/> \"Do you guys think I should fly ahead and do some scouting before we run into them?\" I ask the others, as Flower closes the transceiver.<br/>\"Look, Barry,\" Daren says, \"I know you're excited to try out your new flying technique in an actual non-training scenario, but maybe this isn't really the right time to do it. I doubt you could find out much more about them by watching them from above than we already know from their auras, but if they have really long-ranged spells in their arsenal, you could risk getting attacked. Let's all stick together for now, okay?\"<br/><br/>",

I'd rather not start fighting them until Barry can join the fight properly with his emergency stats.\"<br/><br/> \"I'll help you as soon as I deal with these annoying necromancers,\" Kate says, as she uses her scepter to create four much bigger cones of ice, which she now sends towards the four enemy mages at an explosive speed, managing to shatter the stillwater's barrier quite easily.<br/>However, despite her icicles properly reaching their targets this time, her attacks do not have the desired effect at all, because the projectiles just go straight through the four mages as if they weren't even there.<br/><br/>\"They were illusions this whole time?!\" Arraka shouts, all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"Damn it, Arraka!\" Daren says, as he is still struggling to keep his barrier up against the relentless attacks of the skeleton stillwaters. \"I thought you were supposed to be helping! You have the sharpest magical sense in the team by far, and you still couldn't figure out that they were illusions?!\"<br/><br/>",

Look, they're not even getting past Kate's ice dome at the moment!\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" I say. \"Maybe they're not really stillwaters? Or maybe they're conserving their energy for some reason. Oh, or what if--\"<br/><br/>I don't get to finish what I had to say, because one second later a huge explosion envelops us all out of nowhere, giving us no time to react to it.

Daren puts his shield in front of him to create a barrier, but he wasn't quick enough to fully materialize it, so we all get thrown on our backs by the force of the impact.<br/><br/>\"That's ENOUGH!!!\" Kate and Diane both shout at exactly the same time, as they get up from the ground and they suddenly cover the whole area around us in ice and electricity.<br/><br/>Five metallic devices which I assume to be explosive traps are now showing up all of a sudden, completely frozen and with zap marks from Diane's previous electrical currents. The devices were scattered randomly all around the clearing and seemed to have been placed somewhat in a hurry, by the looks of it.<br/><br/>As the stillwater illusions are fading away, we now see that only two of the skeletons were in fact real, and that the four mages had been standing behind one of them this whole time, hidden by Clogworth's illusion. The skeleton that was attacking Daren's barrier got frozen by Kate, while the other skeleton, who was defending the four mages, managed to create a wall of stone in front of them to shield them from Kate and Diane's attacks.<br/><br/>\"You double-crossing bastard!\" says the necromancer leader to the illusionist mage. \"You were going to kill the little girl in that explosion too, weren't you?\"<br/><br/> \"I wasn't going to kill her until you told me to my face that you were planning to betray me,\" Clogworth says, as he seems to be quickly tapping some buttons on a small device that he is holding in his hand. \"These explosives were meant as a last resort, in case you turned out to be too incompetent to finish the job. I suppose this is what I get for trying to rely on my teammates. I should have just used the explosives from the start.\"<br/>\"Don't let them get away, you nitwits!!!\" Arraka shouts at us, angrily. \"Kill them! Kill them!!!\"<br/><br/>\"They're getting away?...\" Hadrik asks, confused.<br/><br/>\"We're getting away?!\" the necromancer shouts, at the same time.<br/><br/>\"Shut it,\" Clogworth tells his teammate, in a disgusted tone, and then he pushes one last button on his device.<br/><br/>",

And next time you won't be so--\"<br/><br/>\"Lucky?...\" Flower tries to guess the last word of the illusionist mage's sentence, as he and his allies disappear from right under our noses.<br/><br/>Right before they got away, Kate managed to shoot one last icicle at Clogworth, but by that time, the teleportation spell had already dematerialized his body to such a degree that the projectile went straight through him.<br/><br/>\"ARGH!\" Arraka exclaims. \"I can't believe it!

If you don't want them to get away like this, work faster next time.\"<br/><br/>\"Bah...\" Arraka says in indignation, although it doesn't seem like she's planning to provide any counter-arguments to Daren's claim that she did indeed have a contribution to our team's failure this time around.<br/><br/> \"Are there any more hidden explosives that we should be aware of?\" Illuna says. \"I wouldn't want to blow up by accident after the enemy has already retreated...\"<br/>\"No,\" Arraka says, as she is now calming down. \"The illusionist placed most of those traps in a hurry, so he didn't have time to set up too many of them.

        "text": " \"Hold on,\" I say. \"Do you remember how I told you that I noticed the illusionist burying something in the ground just as I flew above him? I think I might know where he hid the teleporter. If I'm not mistaken, it should be right about... there!\"<br/>I then point towards an empty patch of grass further ahead, and I advance towards it, while Daren also follows me. As soon as I reach it, I get down on my knees and start digging through the grass with my bare hands.<br/><br/>As expected, the ground feels soft while I'm digging through it, making it obvious that somebody had already dug a hole here before me. After a few more seconds of tossing dirt to the side, the illusion finally wears off, and the grass disappears completely, leaving behind only the brown soil that was covering up the device.<br/><br/>Seeing that I had indeed found the right spot, Daren starts digging with me as well, and soon, we manage to unearth a round metallic contraption, about the size of a small watermelon. I'm not really familiar with these types of devices, but from Daren's reaction, it does seem like it was exactly what he was looking for.<br/><br/> \"Perfect!\" Daren says, as he is now pulling out his enchanting tools from his backpack. \"Just give me one minute to turn this into a proper magic amplifier, and then we can go.\"<br/>\"How exactly would one go about using such an amplifier?...\" Illuna asks. \"Would you have to hold it in your hands while casting spells?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Daren says, as he is working on the metal sphere with his tools. \"It's enough to stand near it, and it will automatically connect itself to your aura. I'll let you test it as soon as I'm done. Just give me a second...\"<br/><br/>Once Daren finishes his work on the device, he kicks it lightly and lets it roll all the way to Illuna. He then tells her to give it a try with whatever spell she'd like.<br/><br/>Illuna nods, and she chooses to use the same spell that she had been using to wash dishes earlier this morning. From an outsider's perspective, it's hard to tell the difference between her regular spell and this slightly amplified one, but Illuna at the very least seems to be pretty satisfied with it.<br/><br/>\"It's better than I expected,\" Illuna says. \"I can actually keep the spell stable a lot easier with this. How long did you say this amplifier can last?\"<br/><br/> \"One full day at most,\" Daren says. \"You can hold on to it if you want.

As I look at this 'sacred woods' from beyond the invisible border, I can't help but observe the fact that there is absolutely no difference between the two sides of the forest, except for a very, very faint golden tint in the air that could easily be mistaken for the sun's light coming through the leaves of the trees.<br/>The only reason why I'm even noticing this difference at all is because Flower told me about it. Normally, there would have been absolutely no way for me to know that what lies beyond me is forbidden territory just by looking at it, which only makes the fox's strict policy towards trespassers seem even more ridiculous than it already was.<br/><br/> \"Over there!\" Flower shouts. \"I see one!\"<br/>It looks like Flower already activated the detector, because I can indeed see a pinecone glowing brightly with a yellow light from one of the pine trees close to the border. The girl quickly runs towards the tree, she snatches the pinecone from it, and then she lifts it in the air victoriously, while the light from it slowly fades away.<br/><br/> \"I got it!\" Flower says, happily. \"I got it!\"<br/>Mere moments after making her declaration, a large column of yellow light appears out of nowhere behind Flower, and once it disappears, we see that the golden fox was now standing in its place. <br/><br/>Although Flower most likely noticed the fox teleporting behind her, she seems to be frozen in place, unable to speak a word.<br/><br/>",

Maybe they'll warm up to him after some more time has passed.<br/><br/> Just as we were starting to relax, we see Eiden standing in the middle of the road in front of us, with his eyes closed and the same polite smile on his face as always. I wonder what he wants now?...<br/>\"Good day, my friends!\" Eiden says, once we come closer to him. \"I see that you've added a new member to your group. How are things, Leo? It's been a while hasn't it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, it's... been a while,\" Leo says, looking very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>\"Oh, and you've got a glowing pinecone with you as well!\" Eiden tells us. \"Magnificent work! I'm sure that the tournament organizers will be proud!\"<br/><br/> \"Is there any... particular reason why you chose to visit us this time?\" Daren asks.<br/>\"There are a few...\" Eiden says. \"First of all, I wanted to ask you if you've given any more thought to Meridith's deal about killing me. It's been more than two days since then, so I was thinking that this topic of conversation may have come up once or twice, no?\"<br/><br/>",

All I want is to spend some time with my friend on my way to the diplomatic meeting from Galamir. That's it!\"<br/>\"Quite the bold claim you are making, considering that you have been obscuring your aura this whole time,\" Eiden says. \"You know full-well that there is no way for me to tell whether you are lying or not.

Normally, I would have just murdered your entire group and been done with it, but I did make that one promise to Barry to spare you in exchange for the message that he delivered to Meridith, which is why I am making this compromise. Your friend, Diane, is the second-in-command of a powerful faction whose leader has openly declared that she wants me dead. She knew exactly what risks she was taking when she came to the surface and embarked on this journey with you. Do you really want to throw your life away by taking her side in this war?\"<br/><br/> \"You know what?\" Hadrik says, as he goes in front of Diane as well. \"You can take your generous offer and shove it up your arse. You won't be doing anything to Diane while I'm still standing.\"<br/>\"I'm sorry, but I really don't see how you could stop me,\" Eiden says, with a very puzzled expression on his face, while still keeping his eyes closed.<br/><br/>\"Calm down, Eiden,\" Daren says. \"You don't want to be doing something you'll regret...\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Eiden says. \"Perhaps I've been a little too friendly with your group lately. You seem to once again be forgetting who you are dealing with. Allow me to give you a little reminder.\"<br/><br/>We then feel a powerful invisible force pushing us down, until we are all pinned to the ground, except for Kate, Diane and the leopard.<br/><br/>\"NGH...\" Daren groans. \"Eiden, knock it off! Do you hear me?\"<br/><br/>\"Since Diane is such a good friend of yours, I will give you the chance to save her, Kate,\" Eiden says, while ignoring Daren.<br/><br/>Just as he is done saying this, Diane suddenly begins to choke, gasping for air, as she is being lifted into the air by Eiden's aura manipulation technique.<br/><br/>\"If you can stop me by the time your friend runs out of air, I might consider not executing her on the spot,\" Eiden says. \"Let's see how much you've really improved from your training.\"<br/><br/> \"You monster!\" Kate says, as she uses her scepter to conjure a few very powerful icicles and to send them directly towards Eiden at an explosive speed.<br/>Eiden, however blocks them effortlessly with a semi-transparent barrier in front of him, as he continues to choke Diane.<br/><br/>\"Eiden, I'm warning you!\" Daren says, as we are all still being pinned to the ground.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Kate seems to have given up on targeting Eiden directly with her icicles, and she is now aiming them somewhere between Eiden and Diane instead, in an attempt to interrupt his aura manipulation technique.<br/><br/>\"Now you're not even trying,\" Eiden tells Kate, not realizing what she is attempting to do. \"Can't you see that none of your icicles are hitting me anymore?\"<br/><br/>As Diane finally loses her consciousness due to the lack of air, Kate conjures a much more powerful ice cone than before, and this time she shoots it at just the right angle and speed to successfully disrupt Eiden's aura technique. This makes Diane fall to the ground, while Kate quickly runs to her side, in order to check if she is still breathing.<br/><br/>\"She's alive...\" Kate says, as she lets out a sigh of relief. \"She's still alive...\"<br/><br/>",

Marvelous! Outstanding! It looks like I might have underestimated how much progress you've made in such little time.

Ten percent, maybe?...\"<br/><br/> \"You really like to hear yourself talk, don't you?\" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he instantly dashes in front of Eiden and tries to punch him, but only manages to make a hole in the ground, as Eiden jumps out of the way easily.<br/>\"I see that you are eager to resume our duel from the beginning of the tournament,\" Eiden tells Hadrik. \"Shall I abstain from using magic again, to make it more sporting?\"<br/><br/>\"Sure, you can do whatever you want,\" Hadrik says, as he rushes towards Eiden again, and tries to overwhelm his defenses with a series of quick punches.<br/><br/>For the first ten seconds or so, it looked like Eiden had the upper hand, dodging every single one of Hadrik's attacks effortlessly. However, after a relatively short amount of time, we could see the tide of battle shifting rapidly in Hadrik's favor, as he was now pushing Eiden back and forcing him in a much more defensive position.<br/><br/> Eventually, Eiden was no longer able to avoid one of the punches, and he had no choice but to block it, while being thrown ten feet backwards due to the impact.<br/>\"Hey, now, whatever happened to not using magic?\" Hadrik asks Eiden, with a wide grin on his face. \"Or are you going to claim that this wasn't a magical barrier that you used to defend yourself a second ago?\"<br/><br/>Eiden frowns at him, but he does not answer his question.<br/><br/>\"That thing where you read my aura to predict my next move is impressive,\" Hadrik says, \"but unfortunately for you, Daren's been doing it to me for days now, and I already have a pretty good idea how to counter it. As long as I don't have a clear image in my head of where my next attack will be and rely on my instincts to do most of the work, the aura gets jumbled enough for you to not be able to get a good reading of it most of the time. In other words, you may as well just stop using that technique altogether because it's useless against me.\"<br/><br/>\"Eiden, let's just stop this nonsense,\" Daren says, as he is slowly approaching Eiden. \"You're not thinking straight.

As the two of them are fighting, I can hear Arraka mumbling to herself like a crazy person from inside her amulet.<br/><br/>\"No, no, no...\" Arraka says. \"It's too soon for this. If Eiden gets serious, this is over... He's going to ruin everything!\"<br/><br/> It's funny, because I was just thinking the same thing. If Eiden were to get serious now and use the same amount of magical power that he displayed against Tyrath's magma-form in the Thilias arena, this fight will end in a flash. Our only chances are to de-escalate the conflict somehow or to beat him while he's still messing around and not unleashing his full power.<br/>To be quite honest, I'm still having some trouble accepting the reality in front of me. After having avoided a conflict with Eiden for so long, it was beginning to seem almost impossible that we would ever be put in such a situation again. I honestly thought that we might even be able to reach the very end of the tournament without having to fight him at all. But maybe it's not too late! Maybe there are some words that I can say to him which will make him change his mind. I've done it before, so I can do it again, right? I just need to find the right words!<br/><br/>",

That could work, right?\"<br/>\"An enchanter's oath, you say...\" Eiden tells me, while he is still evading Daren's sword attacks.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, wouldn't that solve all of your problems?\" I tell him, as I feel myself getting a little nervous. \"And then we could put all this conflict behind us and we'd continue to interact like we always do!\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Eiden disappears from where he was and he reappears right in front of me, staring at me with his closed eyes, but with the smile gone from his face.<br/><br/> \"You disappoint me, Barry,\" Eiden says. \"Your friends immediately understood that this time there was no room for negotiation, so they decided to take the most logical course of action and bet their lives on the very small chance that they might defeat me. In the meantime, what are you doing? Trying to cling to the hope that I might spare you again for my own amusement? Thinking that your empty declaration to save all of the Varathian cities will somehow guarantee that I'd never kill you under any circumstances? What was the point of dedicating your entire life to becoming a mage, if you're not even willing to use your magic to save you in such a dire moment? Tell me, Barry, were you in fact just a coward this whole time?...\"<br/>My instincts immediately tell me that this is not like any of the other times when I've faced Eiden before. This time he's actually planning to kill me for real. I need to get away from here, quick.<br/><br/> I do not wait for Eiden to make a move, and I use my air currents to propel myself into the air, as I point my palms towards him from above, in an attempt to shoot him with one of my spells. As soon as I look towards Eiden, however, I realize that he is already gone. <br/>I frantically begin to look around me in every direction, to figure out where he teleported. Where is he? Above? Below? Behind? Where?!<br/><br/>\"He's invisible, you moron!\" Arraka shouts at me. \"Behind you!!!\"<br/><br/>I do not get the time to turn around, because I can feel a hand grabbing my head from behind, and the next thing I know is that my head explodes in a thousand pieces, killing me in an instant.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " There is no point in trying to de-escalate now. Eiden has clearly made up his mind about killing Diane, and he's not going to take no for an answer. The only way to get out of this situation alive is to beat him. But how?...<br/>While I am trying to think of a plan of action, I see Daren swinging his sword again, but this time Eiden blocks it with only his index finger.<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Daren says. \"You know, these tricks used to be a lot more shocking back when I didn't know anything about auras. All you're doing right now is focusing all of your aura hardening ability on a single point, in order to make it much stronger than normal, aren't you? But then all I would need to do in this case is to simply spin my blade like this, and then--\"<br/><br/>Less than a second after Daren starts spinning his blade, Eiden teleports away from him in the blink of an eye and reappears about ten feet behind his original position.<br/><br/>\"Ah, see?\" Daren says. \"There we go! Of course you wouldn't want me to actually stab you with this sword, because then you'd risk me cutting your connection to the magical plane! It's not so easy pretending to be all-powerful when people can understand what you're doing, is it?\"<br/><br/> \"That sword of yours is admittedly becoming a bit of a nuisance,\" Eiden says, as he now extends his arm towards Daren and does a pulling motion with it.<br/>\"Oh, by all means, take my sword!\" Daren says, as he lets go of his weapon and lets it fly towards Eiden.<br/><br/>As the sword is approaching him, it begins to accelerate and spin very rapidly like a rotor blade. This forces Eiden to teleport out of the way once again, but the blade just keeps following him every time he disappears and reappears.<br/><br/>\"What's the matter?\" Daren says, as he is moving his hands to change the direction of his blade. \"Don't want my sword anymore?\"<br/><br/>Seeing that teleporting is not working, Eiden tries to blast the flying weapon away with air magic, but the spinning sword just absorbs the air element and sends it right back at him by itself.<br/><br/>As soon as the spinning rotor blade reaches its target again, Eiden teleports away once more, but this time he attempts to fly out of its way instead of disappearing.<br/><br/>\"That's an illusion, you idiot!!!\" Arraka shouts. \"The real Eiden is invisible behind you!\"<br/><br/> A mere fraction of a second after Arraka says this, Hadrik instantly dashes behind Daren from the side, and he punches the empty air in front of him, making Eiden become visible again, as he gets thrown into one of the trees on the side of the road.<br/>\"You are helping them now, Arraka?\" Eiden says, while he gets back on his feet and dusts himself off. \"That's not really very fair, is it?\"<br/><br/>\"Shut your filthy mouth, you waste of human life!!!\" Arraka shouts, angrily. \"Don't you understand that all of my plans are going to be ruined because of you? Because of you!!!\"<br/><br/>\"I honestly have no idea what you're talking about,\" Eiden says, as Hadrik rushes towards him again and punches him through the tree.<br/><br/>",

Right now, Daren and Hadrik are the only ones actively fighting Eiden, and it's pretty clear that so far he has only been toying with them. Even without releasing his full power, he should be capable of much more than what he's shown so far.<br/>This means that if we catch him by surprise in his current state, we might still have a chance to turn things around. As it stands, we already have a plan prepared for neutralizing the Arraka from the past, which is supposed to be more powerful than Eiden's strongest form. However, in order for that plan to work, Eiden would need to stand in place for a few seconds and to also be distracted enough to not attempt to block Kate's ice beam.<br/><br/>Let me think. Is there some way in which I could get Eiden to stand in place and not pay attention to what Kate is doing?...<br/><br/>Wait! There is a way! I actually have the perfect spells I need, and I've even practiced them multiple times! But I'm still going to need him to be considerably weakened before I cast these spells if I want them to have the best effect on him.<br/><br/> And for that, I'm going to need some help.<br/>\"Flower, Illuna,\" I say. \"We need to put some more pressure on Eiden. Can I count on you?\"<br/><br/>\"I trust that you've come up with a plan of some sort?\" Illuna asks me.<br/><br/>\"I have, but I'd rather not talk about it out loud, because I'm not sure how much Eiden has enhanced his hearing ability,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Understood,\" Illuna says. \"In that case, whenever you're ready.\"<br/><br/>I nod at her, and then I turn to Kate, who is still standing near the unconscious Diane, in order to be ready to defend her from harm.<br/><br/> \"Kate,\" I say, \"do you remember our plan to take down the Arraka from the past?\"<br/>\"I remember it, yes,\" Kate answers me.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" I say, \"Then, I'm going to need you to save up your energy as much as possible, and not do anything until I set up the perfect opportunity for you. You'll know it when it happens.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, I'll be waiting, then,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " I don't wait for Eiden to make his next move and I land close to one of the fallen trees that didn't get burned by his previous fire spell. I then pick it up, in order to use it as a weapon, and I take full advantage of my maxed speed stat to rush towards Eiden and swing the tree at him as hard as I can. This catches him by surprise and he doesn't have the time to fully defend against it. My blow sends him crashing through several trees before he finally teleports in front of me, looking slightly pissed off.<br/>\"I'm going to be honest with you, Barry,\" Eiden says. \"That annoyed me a little.\"<br/><br/>I try to use my tree as a club to squash him like a bug, but I only get to hit the ground, because Eiden is already gone.<br/><br/>\"Behind you!\" Arraka shouts at me. \"He's invisible!\"<br/><br/>Immediately after hearing Arraka's warning, I grab the tree firmly in my hands and I begin to spin around with it very rapidly, so that I can be sure to hit Eiden, wherever he's hiding. This causes his invisibility to get cancelled, while he gets thrown back twenty feet again. Once more, he teleports in mid-air and appears in front of me, but this time he immediately grabs my tree with his hand and explodes it in a thousand pieces.<br/><br/>Being left without my weapon, I dash towards another fallen tree, I pick it up from the ground, but now I no longer use it as a club and throw it at him instead. As Eiden is using a spell to blow up the tree just as it reaches him, I grab a few rocks and throw those at him too.<br/><br/> In the meantime, Hadrik decides to join in on the fun by picking up a tree of his own from the ground, jumping at Eiden and trying to smash his head in with it.<br/>\"Now this is just ridiculous...\" Eiden says, as he is blocking Hadrik's tree with one hand, and using his other hand to shield himself from my constant rock throwing.<br/><br/>Eiden now teleports next to me again and attempts to attack me with a spell, but I make use of my superhuman speed and reflexes to not give him even the slightest chance to target me. I keep moving left and right, faster than the eye can see, trying to make it as hard as possible for him to get a good lock on me with even the quickest spells in existence.<br/><br/>Seeing that his targeted spells are not working, Eiden conjures ten large boulders out of nowhere and throws them all in my general direction, so that he can be sure that at least one of them will hit me. I stop for a split second to punch through one of the boulders, but this gives Eiden the time to cast a very quick fire spell, which covers my entire body before I have the time to react. Luckily for me, my maxed Aura hardening stat was enough to keep me from getting incinerated, even though I could feel a very intense heat for a second or two.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Daren's sword comes spinning rapidly towards Eiden, forcing him to temporarily go on the defensive, as he teleports away constantly while the blade keeps following him.<br/><br/> We can't let this fight drag on for much longer. If Eiden stops treating this like a game and goes into his serious mode, all of the trees in the world won't be enough to stop him.<br/>\"Illuna, do you think you can cast your 'dish washing' spell on Eiden?\" I say. \"By the looks of him, I don't think he is calm enough to properly defend himself from something like that at the moment.\"<br/><br/>\"I'll give it a try,\" Illuna says. \"But I'm not promising anything.\"<br/><br/>She then casts her spell, causing Eiden's head to get surrounded by a sphere of water while he was still busy evading Daren's sword. This seems to have caught him completely off guard, because I can already hear him making drowning noises, while he is at the same time flying up and down, so that he can keep dodging the spinning blade that is following him.<br/><br/>Realizing that he can't get rid of the sword or the water sphere, Eiden conjures a small tornado out of thin air and he lets himself get caught inside it on purpose. This proves to be a little too much for Illuna's drowning spell, and its water particles eventually scatter into the air, while the enchanted sword also fails to absorb the air element making up the tornado and gets caught in it instead, causing Daren to temporarily summon back his weapon.<br/><br/>As Eiden cancels the tornado, he falls to the ground again and then puts his hand on his forehead, without doing anything else for a few seconds. His head must be spinning like crazy right now. This is the moment I've been waiting for. It's now or never!<br/><br/>",

This proves to be a little too much for Illuna's drowning spell, and its water particles eventually scatter into the air.<br/>As Eiden cancels the tornado, he falls to the ground again and then puts his hand on his forehead, without doing anything else for a few seconds.

I now immediately turn around and start to shoot flames out of my hands at the empty air behind me, thinking that Eiden was trying to hide invisibly again in the same way that he did against Daren, but it doesn't seem like I'm hitting anything.<br/><br/>Just as I thought I was safe, I can feel Eiden's invisible hand grabbing my head from above and exploding it into a thousand pieces, killing me in an instant.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch12_hadrik || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_b3_ch12_scout || 0) == 3) {%> \"Illuna, can you cast your dish washing spell on Eiden, please?\" I say.<br/>\"I'm not sure if now would be the best time,\" Illuna says, apprehensively.<br/><br/>\"No, it's the perfect time, trust me!\" I say. \"Do it now!\"<br/><br/>\"At least let me get the teleporting device from Hadrik's backpack,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Oh, I have it right here,\" says Hadrik from the ground, as he takes the round metal device from his backpack and prepares to toss it to Illuna, who was just now descending from the sky.<br/><br/>\"No, don't throw it!\" Illuna shouts, but it was too late.<br/><br/>She managed to grab the heavy metal ball while still airborne, but it almost made her drop to the ground from the weight of it.<br/><br/>Once she successfully landed, she put the device on the ground next to her and began preparing her spell.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch12_hadrik || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_b3_ch12_scout || 0) == 3) {%> \"Dish washing spell?

I don't see him drowning yet, but he can't be too comfortable either, from the expression he is making. After unsuccessfully trying to shake the water away by flying sideways, Eiden is now teleporting really fast all over the place, in an attempt to make Illuna lose control of her spell.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch12_hadrik || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_b3_ch12_scout || 0) == 3) {%> Fortunately, Illuna's training and the use of her magic amplifier are paying off, and Eiden isn't managing to get rid of the water sphere at all. Eventually, he begins to make drowning noises, which causes him to get a little more desperate and to conjure a small tornado, while allowing himself to get caught inside it. This proves to be a little too much for Illuna's drowning spell, and its water particles eventually scatter into the air.<br/>As Eiden cancels the tornado, he falls to the ground and then puts his hand on his forehead, without doing anything else for a few seconds. His head must be spinning like crazy right now. This is the moment I've been waiting for. It's now or never!<br/><br/><% } %>",

He could still easily stop Kate's ice beam if he had the time to react. In order to make him not be aware of his surroundings at all, we need one final push.<br/><br/>Daren now sends his sword spinning rapidly towards Eiden, but the stillwater raises a large spike made out of rock from the ground, which he uses to divert the weapon's direction. In the meantime, Eiden conjures a small tornado out of thin air and he lets himself get caught inside it on purpose. This proves to be a little too much for Illuna's drowning spell, and its water particles eventually scatter into the air.<br/><br/>As Eiden cancels the tornado, he falls to the ground again and then puts his hand on his forehead, without doing anything else for a few seconds. His head must be spinning like crazy right now. This is the moment I've been waiting for. It's now or never!<br/><br/><% } %>",

        "text": " I waste no time and I cast my dizziness spell on Eiden. If this is the same as when I tested the spell on Diane, he should normally be hearing a ringing in his ears right now... the exact same kind of ringing noise that you would hear if Wolford's daze had been cast on you.<br/>If Eiden were in a calm state of mind, he would have easily noticed that the magical flow of my dizziness spell was slightly different, but with the way he is at the moment, and considering that Wolford's daze gives you only a limited time to cancel it before it fully activates, Eiden really only has one choice. He needs to open his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Daren, catch!\" I shout loudly, while Eiden opens his eyes widely and looks around himself in order to cancel my fake Wolford's daze spell.<br/><br/>Hearing the code word that we've been practicing endlessly during the past two days, all of my friends close their eyes instinctively, and then I close mine as well, while I cast my blinding flash of light.<br/><br/>Given that Eiden spends the majority of his time with his eyes closed, I can only imagine how sensitive he must be to sudden bright flashes of light. If my assumption is correct, then a sudden shock like this should overload all of his senses, including his magical sense.<br/><br/>\"Kate--\" I start to say, but now I see that she was already pointing her scepter towards Eiden, while readying her spell.<br/><br/>\"I'm on it,\" Kate says, and then she shoots Eiden with an ice beam even more powerful than the one she showed us yesterday.<br/><br/> Just as I'd hoped, Eiden doesn't block the spell at all, and he gets encased in a large block of ice, unable to move an inch. Wow, this has gone so much better than I thought it would! Now there is only one final step left and everything will be over! One final step...<br/>As I calm down and think about this final step more clearly, I suddenly realize that there may have been a huge flaw in my plan that I hadn't accounted for at all. This whole plan was originally designed to kill the past version of Arraka, not Eiden. It goes without saying that Daren would be able to kill Arraka's copy without any hint of hesitation, but does the same apply for Eiden?...<br/><br/>Taking a look at Daren now, it is clear that he understands his role in this plan and knows the gravity of the situation, but even so, he is just staring at the block of ice with his sword in his hands, unable to act.<br/><br/>I think I know exactly what must be going through his head in this moment. The entire fight, Daren has been focused on stabbing Eiden once with his enchanted sword, so that he could cut off his connection to the magical plane and make him essentially powerless, without actually killing him. Now he has in front of him a large block of ice, of unknown durability, which he needs to cut through in order to get to Eiden. If he were to use his full strength, he could easily cut Eiden in half along with the ice, and kill him on the spot, but if he were to want to only lightly stab him in order to cut off his source of energy, he would need surgical precision.<br/><br/> He can't afford to cut through the ice more than once, because that could risk allowing Eiden to free himself, so he only has one shot at this. But is it something that he can realistically accomplish without risking all of our lives in the process?<br/>\"Daren?...\" Flower asks, in a worried tone, after she sees him staring at the block of ice in front of him for more than five seconds, while sweating heavily. \"Is everything okay?\"<br/><br/>\"What are you hesitating for, you imbecile?!\" Arraka shouts all of a sudden. \"Do you really think he would have shown you any mercy if your positions were reversed? You have the opportunity of a lifetime to kill Eiden once and for all and you're hesitating?! Hurry up and do it already, before he--\"<br/><br/>\"Too late,\" we hear Eiden's voice, as the block of ice surrounding him explodes into pieces, and the amount of magical power radiating from his aura becomes just as high as it was when he was facing Tyrath in Thilias.<br/><br/>Oh, no... It's over. We really are too late...<br/><br/>\"Maybe I've been messing around a little too much,\" Eiden says, in a very serious tone of voice, as the intensity of his aura alone is making it hard for us to breathe. \"It's time to end this.\"<br/><br/>",

You want someone to prove to you that you were wrong to abandon humanity, and that there is still some hope left! Let us help you! I know that it may seem like a long shot to you at the moment, and you probably think that you are wasting your time by letting us live, but at least give us a chance! You know that we can make a difference!\"<br/>\"I'm afraid that it's a little too late for that, Daren,\" Eiden says, in a grim tone.<br/><br/>\"But why?...\" Daren says. \"Why would it be too late?\"<br/><br/>\"Because the blue crystals have awakened,\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>\"...What?\" Daren asks, looking like he was caught completely off guard by that answer. \"What does that have to do with any--\"<br/><br/>\"Do you seriously think that your little quest to save a few cities from an island in the middle of nowhere is the only thing on my mind?\" Eiden says. \"There are far more important things at stake here than Varathia. And if Meridith gets what she wants, whether she realizes it or not, it will be the end of us all, not only in this world, but likely others as well.\"<br/><br/>\"Whoa, whoa... Slow down!\" Daren says. \"We didn't know about any of that! Is it because of one of the Magium fragments? Look, if you just told us what this is all about, we could--\"<br/><br/> \"No,\" Eiden says, simply. \"I can't be bothered to tell you the myriad of reasons why Diane needs to die, and even if I did, you would still not accept it. You had your chance to stop me, but you've failed. Now... you must face the consequences.\"<br/>\"EIDEN!!!\" Arraka shouts all of a sudden, in a more furious tone than we've ever heard her speak in before. \"If you kill any of them, I promise you that I will spend the rest of my life traveling the infinite space of the ether until I find your sanctuary, then I will rip your soul out of it with my bare hands and torture it for all eternity!!! Do you understand me?! I am going to make your life a literal hell!!!\"<br/><br/>\"What in the world has gotten into you?...\" Eiden says, looking very confused. \"I'm not going to kill Flower, if that's what you're worried about. I'm still keeping my promise to the old fox for the time being, at least.\"<br/><br/>\"Did you start closing your ears along with your eyes?!\" Arraka says. \"I said that if you kill ANY of them, I am going to make you regret it for as long as you'll live! Do you have any idea how much work I've put into this plan? It's the first time I've felt so alive in five thousand years!!! And now you want to take that away from me? To take my perfect revenge against the gods away from me?! You have no idea to what lengths I am willing to go to make your life miserable if you go through with this!\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on, there...\" Eiden says. \"For a second, it almost sounded like you were saying that you've been training these people to kill the gods in your place, but clearly that's not what you meant?...\"<br/><br/>\"It is EXACTLY what I meant, you pompous cretin!!!\" Arraka shouts.<br/><br/> \"No...\" Eiden says, as he just spends a few seconds in silence, looking as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"No, it can't be...\"<br/>He then pauses for a few more seconds, still unable to come up with a coherent sentence to respond to Arraka.<br/><br/>\"You are training them to kill gods?...\" Eiden says, as he finally seems to be finding his words. \"These... these CLOWNS?! You want them to kill GODS?\"<br/><br/>He then stays silent again for a while, as if he were hoping for Arraka to tell him that it was all a joke, and she wasn't being serious.<br/><br/>\"Look at them!!!\" Eiden says, as he points towards us. \"I could kill them all with a flick of my finger if I wanted to!\"<br/><br/>\"They almost killed you, you jackass!\" Arraka says. \"You can gloat all you like, but if Daren didn't take pity on you like the moron he is, you would have been cut clean in half! You think that doesn't count because you weren't fighting at your full power? Who do you think I am?! The idiot dwarf? You think I care that the fight wasn't 'honorable'? You would have been DEAD, you fool! And the same goes for all the gods! You have no idea how much stronger these weaklings could have gotten in just a week or two with my guidance! You have no idea!!!\"<br/><br/>",

You look old, and they call you a sage, but the wise thing to do in this situation would have been to stay safely where you were hiding, and let me kill these people. What madness could have possessed you to come here and confront me when I am in my strongest form? Do you really think you can defeat me in battle?...\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, heavens, no!\" Azarius says, with a calm smile. \"I wouldn't dream of it!\"<br/><br/>\"Then how exactly do you intend to stop me?\" Eiden says, perplexed.<br/><br/>\"I thought you might ask me that!\" Azarius says, and then he snaps his fingers once.<br/><br/> \"What did you-- how--\" Eiden begins to say, as he seems to be looking somewhere far off in the distance, but Azarius interrupts him.<br/>\"I discovered those detection spells of yours that you've been planting all over the continent weeks ago,\" Azarius says. \"I figured that they were very important to you, so I've been tampering with them in secret, while suppressing my aura so you couldn't notice it from a distance. As you have just seen, one snap of my fingers is enough for me to cancel one of your spells and undo hours of your work. Also, it's impossible to fix my tampering without remaking them from scratch. Oh, and most importantly, if you kill me, every single one of your detection spells will be undone, and all of your work for the past few weeks will have been completely wasted!\"<br/><br/> \"I can't believe this...\" Eiden says. \"You are blackmailing me? You are blackmailing ME?!\"<br/>\"Of course,\" Azarius says, with the same calm smile as before. \"Why wouldn't I?\"<br/><br/>",
