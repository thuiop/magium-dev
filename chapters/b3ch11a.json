Is that what you're asking of us?\"<br/><br/>\"That is... not exactly how I would have phrased it, but in essence, you are correct,\" Meridith says, somewhat apprehensively.<br/><br/>\"Do you have no honor?!\" Hadrik says, while giving Meridith a look of pure disgust.<br/><br/>\"Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding,\" Meridith says, in a slightly more nervous tone than before. \"If you will allow me to explain one more time what we need from you, I'm sure we can reach some sort of agreement--\"<br/><br/>\"No, I think I've heard enough,\" Hadrik says, as he gets up from his chair.<br/><br/> Fearing that Hadrik might try to attack her ally, Diane attempts to stand up as well, but Meridith puts her arm in front of her and stops her before she can get up on her feet.<br/>\"You and the rest of your lessathi underlings might be fine with using such underhanded tactics to defeat your enemies, but I will have no part in this,\" Hadrik says. \"Find someone else to do your dirty work!\"<br/><br/>He then turns away from us and storms out of the room, without looking back once.<br/><br/>\"Hadrik! Hey, Hadrik, wait up!\" Daren shouts, but he gets no response.<br/><br/>\"I think I'd better go after him,\" Daren says, this time turning to Meridith. \"The last thing we want is for him to get in some conflict with a lessathi from one of your opposing factions while he's still pissed off. I'll try to bring him back, if I can.\"<br/><br/>\"There is no need,\" Meridith says, as she still seems to be collecting her thoughts after what just happened. \"We will resume this meeting at a later time. I'm sure that you all have a lot to think about.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" Daren says. \"We'll see you again later, then. Let me see if I can catch up to Hadrik in the meantime.\"<br/><br/>",

Do your friends consider him a friend or a foe?\"<br/><br/>\"Isn't this maybe something that you should have considered asking before telling us to kill him?...\" Kate says, confused.<br/><br/>\"You're right,\" Meridith says. \"I should have asked you this before, but I suppose that I never really considered the possibility that anyone could take that mass-murderer's side, except for maybe Melindra, who has known him for a very long time.

        "text": " \"You may not be aware of this, but the 'Magical power' and 'Magical knowledge' stats were in fact the first two stats that were implemented in these devices,\" Meridith says. \"Back when these stat boosters were only prototypes, the lessathi who originally made them were aiming to use these devices to give themselves and the other members of our race the ability to cast magic. Unfortunately, after many years of failed experiments, they eventually found out that it was phisically impossible for pure lessathi to cast magic like a normal mage, and that the only ones who could properly use these stats were the half-lessathi. Realizing that the two magical stats were useless to them, the lessathi locked them behind a secret code, and then began to work on twelve new stats, which were fundamentally different in both purpose and design from the two original stats.\"<br/> \"Why are they so different?\" I say. \"Isn't it still the basic principle of the device gathering energy from other mages and then converting that energy into points that can be used to augment different abilities?\"<br/><br/> \"First of all, your understanding of how the stat boosters work is slightly incorrect,\" Meridith says. \"While it is true that some of these stats are augmenting abilities that you already possess, such as your hearing, strength and speed, not all of your twelve stats work in the same way, as I'm sure you've already noticed. For example, the ancient languages and combat technique stats make it possible for you to access large amounts of information through your aura, but the amount of knowledge made available to you is limited by your current level in that stat, as a safety precaution so that your brain doesn't get overloaded by accident. Even though it may seem to you like the information is present in your head, you are in fact only accessing it by linking your aura to that of the stat device. This is also why you lose access to all of the information when the stat device is no longer connected to your aura.\"<br/>\"Oh, I think I get it now,\" I say. \"So, what you're saying is that the only thing that these stats have in common is the energy source, but the way they work is in fact different for each stat. If I were to guess, I'd say that the stats which increase my physical attributes based on my own abilities are based on the ability enhancing spells that are already being used by generalists to augment their hearing, focus, reflexes, and so on, right?\"<br/><br/> \"Precisely,\" Meridith says. \"In other words, the lessathi who were working on these stat boosters gave up on the idea of using them to turn themselves into mages, and they began designing the devices as tools to cast magic for them, instead. Essentially, what they did with many of these twelve new stats was that they copied multiple existing spells and techniques that were already being used by mages, and they found ways to implement them so that they could be cast by the device itself, while its wielder had their aura linked to it. The same principle also applied to the three aura stats, which were based on skills and techniques that were most commonly used by mages who were reasonably proficient in aura manipulation.\"<br/>\"What about the premonition stat?\" Kate asks. \"I don't seem to recall any existing spells that can foresee the future...\"<br/><br/>\"The premonition stat was most likely developed by using knowledge that they obtained from one of the Magium nodes,\" Meridith says. \"While it pains me to admit this, the lessathi of old were much more skilled at extracting information from Magium nodes than us, so I cannot confirm this theory, since it would be impossible for us to create devices of this complexity. However, what I do know is that the time weavers that are sent by the Magium possess the ability to see small glimpses of future events, so it is my assumption that the stat device must also be using a similar technique for its premonition stat.\"<br/><br/>",

The point system was only added after they created the other twelve stats, but by that time the two original stats were no longer being worked on, so they never got updated to the new system. In other words, you won't be able to use your existing points to upgrade the two magical stats, but as soon as I unlock them, they will start using the energy stored in the device to level up by themselves, and you won't be able to stop them.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" I say. \"Does this mean that all of the energy collected from now on will be used only for these two stats? Will I not be getting points for my other stats anymore? And what about my existing points? Is there any danger that I might lose any of them?\"<br/><br/> \"You can rest assured that your current points will not be affected by this change,\" Meridith says. \"Once the energy stored in the device gets turned into points, it can only be used by your regular stats, and the magical stats will no longer have any access to that energy. However, while I am certain that you will still be receiving points in the future, the rate at which they will be given to you may become slower than before.\"<br/>\"Well, it can't be worse than it was in Ollendor, right?\" I say. \"I didn't get any points at all while I was in that city.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Meridith says, \"as long as you won't be in a city, you can still expect to get a reasonable amount of points to level up your other stats. We put the majority of our energy extractors near the cities of Varathia, because that was where we assumed most of the contestants would gather, initially. It was only after the kings told us that they wouldn't enforce a rule to prevent the tournament participants from killing each other that we started using teams of lessathi with mobile energy extractors to gather as much energy as we could from the mages scattered throughout the woods of Varathia. Diane was in fact busy escorting one such team when you first encountered her.\"<br/><br/>",

Do you need anything else to activate the stats, or--\"<br/>\"No, just the device is enough,\" Meridith says, as she quickly presses several buttons in a row without even looking at the stat booster, and then she gives it back to me. \"It is done. Your magical stats have been activated.\"<br/><br/>\"That's it?...\" I ask her, confused, as I take a good look at my device. \"I can't say that I'm really... feeling any different.\"<br/><br/>\"At the moment, your stat booster is busy converting its stored energy into levels for your new stats,\" Meridith says. \"As soon as you will get your first level, your device should start beeping to let you know that your magical stats are ready.\"<br/><br/>\"Won't the energy from the device run out much faster now that Barry will use it to cast spells?\" Kate says. \"How will there be enough of it left to level up any of his stats?\"<br/><br/> \"The energy collected from the tournament participants is not being used to cast spells,\" Meridith says. \"It is only used to level up the stats. The magical stats are made in such a way that they give Barry the ability to draw energy from the magical plane by himself to cast his spells, similarly to how all other mages do it. This is the main reason why pure lessathi were never able to use these stats. Since our auras are completely devoid of any magic whatsoever, it is impossible for us to cast spells in the same way as regular mages, no matter how well we construct our devices.\"<br/>\"If the device allows me to draw energy from the magical plane,\" I say, \"then could it be possible for me to feed the device energy by myself instead of relying on what the stat booster extracts from other mages around me? I know for a fact that there are certain tools which can help mages power up devices with magical energy. I've seen them used before!\"<br/><br/>\"Feeding energy directly into the device is very inefficient and wasteful,\" Meridith says. \"If the magical energy is not properly extracted from the auras of other mages, then it will be expended by the device far too fast to be of any real use to you in the long term. You should already know this, since you told me that you've used Emergency Mode in the past. Come to think of it... I never did ask you how exactly you managed to activate this mode before. I can think of very few situations in which the Emergency Mode would activate by itself, and none of them seem very likely. Did you perhaps find some way to activate it manually?\"<br/><br/>",

Let's hope that they didn't get into any trouble.\"<br/>We all do as Meridith said and get up from our seats, as she leads us out of the meeting room and back into the corridor filled with blue crystals. As we are once again passing by the secret door behind which the Magium node can be found, an idea suddenly pops into my head, and without thinking I ask Meridith a question.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Meridith, there's something that I've been wondering,\" I say, as we are now moving away from the Magium node. \"You said that you'd be willing to give us access to the Magium node, but what does that mean, exactly? How are we supposed to interact with it?\"<br/><br/>\"There are certain tools that our people have developed along the years, which make it possible to extract information from the node,\" Meridith says. \"It is a very lenghty process, but also a very rewarding one. The Magium contains knowledge far beyond what you could ever imagine. This wand that I'm carrying, for example, could not have been built without information that I've personally managed to extract from the Magium node. Many of our other devices were also made in the same way.\"<br/><br/> \"So, the only method for us to access the information contained in the Magium is to use your tools, then?\" Kate asks. \"There is no other way?\"<br/>\"There are other ways, of course, but I wouldn't recommend them,\" Meridith says. \"You could, for example link your aura directly to the node, in order to enter the Magium realm. This would grant you a far more direct way to extract the knowledge that you want, but it would also be much more risky. One small mistake, and you could get lost in the Magium realm forever, with no way to get back to our world. Meanwhile, from our point of view, you would be stuck in a trance with yellow glowing eyes for the rest of your life, until you'd finally die of thirst or starvation.\"<br/><br/>Linking your aura directly to the Magium, huh?... I'm pretty sure that this is the technique which Arraka used when we went to the Magium's realm to watch everyone's trials during the God of Time's ritual. I wonder if I could learn how to do that in the future... <br/><br/>\"But what if you were to touch the node for a longer period of time?\" Kate asks. \"Do you know what would happen then?\"<br/><br/> \"Unfortunately, I do,\" Meridith says, in a sad tone of voice. \"Every year or so, we get at least one lessathi who manages to sneak past the security and find his way to the Magium node, just so he could try to touch it. Sadly, almost every single one of them has gone completely insane. After they touch the node, most of them refuse to talk, they refuse to eat or drink, they just want to stay there and stare at the node, and they react very violently if you try to take them away from it. We've found no way to bring them back to their senses, and they usually end up dying from thirst, a few days afterwards.\"<br/>\"You're telling me that you knew how dangerous this Magium node was, and you left us alone with it, without so much as a warning?...\" Kate asks, perplexed.<br/><br/>\"I... didn't think that a warning would be necessary,\" Meridith says. \"Lessathi are by their nature being drawn to the Magium node, which is why we need to keep them as far away from it as possible, but none of the other races have ever manifested any sort of attraction to these nodes. Not even half-lessathi. Why would you ever try to touch such a dangerous-looking thing if you weren't compelled to do so by your very nature?\"<br/><br/>",

For some reason, this bothers me, so I walk closer to it, so that I can get a better look.<br/><br/>\"Barry, what's going on?\" Daren asks me. \"Why did you stop?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know how to explain this to you, but something about this wall doesn't feel natural to me,\" I say, as I touch its surface, to see if I can notice a difference in texture compared to the other seredium rocks. \"Could this particular tunnel be man-made, by any chance?\"<br/><br/>\"It is definitely possible,\" Meridith says. \"These tunnels were here since long before any of us were born, so none of us know exactly how they were created. I don't really understand why that's relevant, though...\"<br/><br/>\"You see,\" I say, \"the thing is that there is this lessathi architect from the old times who left a bunch of puzzle pieces in all the places that he built, and I was wondering if this wasn't by any chance one of them, considering how this is the main lessathi base of operations. Of all the walls in this place, this looks the most suspicious to me, but I can't quite tell why, exactly. Melindra, Flower, you are the rock experts around here. Could you maybe have a quick look?\"<br/><br/> \"We really don't have time for this...\" Meridith says. \"For all we know, your dwarf friend could have already gotten in a drunken brawl with some of the lessathi from the Heksol faction, and if I'm not there to stop it, who knows what--\"<br/>\"I'm sure Hadrik is fine,\" I tell her, as Melindra comes closer and also starts examining the wall. \"What do you say, Melindra? Are you noticing anything peculiar?\"<br/><br/>\"You're definitely right that this place was lessathi-made, by the looks of it,\" Melindra says, \"but I'm not so sure about the puzzle piece. At the very least, I'm not noticing any obvious mechanism that could cause the wall to open. Flower, what do you think?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, there are a few secret knock codes that I've used in other ruins in the past to open secret corridors before,\" Flower says. \"I could try some of those.\"<br/><br/>\"You can't be serious...\" Meridith says. \"This is going to take forever!\"<br/><br/>\"No, no, it will be really quick, watch!\" Flower says, and then she starts knocking on the wall several times, with some pauses in-between the knocks, to see if there's any reaction. \"Okay, that was two of the codes. Three more to go!\"<br/><br/> As soon as Flower finishes the third code, the peculiar-looking rock begins to slide inside the wall by itself, and then it moves to the side, so that a gray stone with writing on it can take its place, leaving just enough space between the stone and the rest of the wall for a small object to be able to fit through. The words on the stone are written in the common language, and they are saying: 'If you like discovering secrets, place your palm upon this rock.'<br/>All of a sudden, I hear Flower gasping, as she is also done reading the writing on the rocky surface.<br/><br/>\"Barry, I think you were right!\" she says. \"This really does feel like the work of that lessathi architect again! Hold on, let me check!\"<br/><br/>She then places her palm on the rock, like the writing said, and a puzzle piece immediately gets thrown out of the hole below the stone, along with a small parchement with text on it that is also written in the common language, saying: 'Find all of the pieces of the puzzle, and I will share with you my greatest secret. I've left one of these in each of the buildings I've designed.'<br/><br/>\"Barry, what are you waiting for?\" Flower tells me. \"Put your palm on the stone, quick! Before it slides back into the wall!\"<br/><br/>",

The last thing I want is for these people to gain new reasons to antagonize me.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, from what I heard, it sounded more like they were having fun with a drinking contest,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Huh...\" Meridith says, a little surprised. \"Well, either way, we can't let them interact for too long. Who knows what could happen if they get too drunk. Follow me.\"<br/><br/>We keep walking for a little while until we reach the path split, and then we head through the tunnel on the right, which apparently seems to be leading towards the Heksol faction's territory, according to the markings on the walls.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, we suddenly hear Hadrik's loud laughter, as he seems to have just finished the drinking contest that he was talking about earlier.<br/><br/> \"You've beaten me fair and square!\" Hadrik says, loudly. \"Here is your reward! You've most certainly earned it!\"<br/><br/> \"You're damn right, I did!\" says the Heksol faction guard. \"Did you really think that serving me two bottles of completely identical ale alongside a third bottle with a nearly indistinguishable difference in taste would somehow throw me off my game? I'll have you know that I used to be friends with a dwarf who was ten times the drinker you are. If he were still with us today, he would have drunk you under the table in a matter of minutes.\"<br/>\"I'm sure he would have,\" Hadrik says, as we are getting closer to him, and now see that he is holding a glass of ale in his hand, while raising it high. \"Let us have a toast in his honor, then. May he always watch over us from above, with a bottle of dwarven ale in his hand, and a big drunken smile on his face!\"<br/><br/>\"Dwarf,\" the guard says, \"this may be the first respectable thing you've said since we met.\"<br/><br/>The two of them now clink their glasses and then they have a good long drink, before they finally notice us.<br/><br/>\"Well, if it isn't the big boss herself!\" Hadrik says, with a grin. \"What are you just standing there, for? Come here. Sit with us. Have a drink!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid that I'll have to refuse your offer,\" Meridith says. \"I have a few important meetings to attend after this, which will require me to remain sober.\" <br/><br/>\"Is she always like this?\" Hadrik asks the lessathi guard, as he pours him another glass of ale.<br/><br/>\"All the time,\" the lessathi guard says, and then he takes a sip from his filled glass.<br/><br/>",

Would you like to give it a try? I happen to have a few more bottles here that I'd love to--\"<br/><br/>\"Umm, no thanks,\" Kate says. \"I was just curious, that's all.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what is it that brings you here, 'lady' Meridith?\" the lessathi guard says, in a disdainful tone. \"It has been some time since I've been 'honored' with your presence.\"<br/><br/> \"Spare me your sarcasm, Kleykarth,\" Meridith says. \"I only came here because I was worried that my dwarf guest might get into a fight with someone from your faction. It seems, however, that my concern was unwarranted.\"<br/>\"From what I heard, the dwarf would have had much more of a reason to pick a fight with you than with us, 'lady' Meridith,\" Kleykarth says. \"In fact, he had quite a few choice words to say about you after his first few glasses of ale. Would you like to hear some of them?\"<br/><br/>\"I would be quite interested, yes...\" Meridith says, while giving Hadrik a cursory glance.<br/><br/>\"Now, now, that won't be necessary!\" Hadrik says, as he puts a hand on the lessathi guard's shoulder.<br/><br/>\"Hahahah!\" Kleykarth laughs. \"I was just messing with you, dwarf. There's no need for you to panic. Your secrets are safe with me!\"<br/><br/>",

Now I'm getting curious to know what they are as well...\"<br/><br/>\"So, you've finally decided to come out of your hiding place, aye?\" Hadrik says, while looking at the man coming out of the darkness, as he pulls out a third glass from his backpack and starts filling it with ale. \"You know, I've been calling out to you for ages, but you never answered. You can have a seat with us, if you want!\"<br/><br/>\"That won't be necessary!\" the man says. \"I am more than happy to stand.\"<br/><br/>When we get a closer look at the man coming out of the shadows, we see that he is wearing a boot on his head and socks on his hands, while having a whole bunch of unintelligible gibberish written on his shirt and pants, which surprisingly, are at least worn correctly. He is also walking barefoot, but considering that Flower has been doing the same thing since we've met her, that doesn't really seem all that weird to me anymore.<br/><br/> \"You say that you want us to tell you about the insults,\" Kleykarth says, \"but you weren't that far away from us when the dwarf said them. Surely you must have heard at least some of the words?\"<br/>\"Unfortunately, I was in a trance at the time, so I couldn't hear anything of what you two were saying,\" says the man with the boot on his head. \"My apologies, good sir!\"<br/><br/>\"A trance?...\" Hadrik asks, confused. \"What are you, some kind of a shaman, or something?\"<br/><br/>\"No, no, nothing of the sort,\" says the man with the boot on his head. \"I was simply trying to get in the right state of mind to communicate with our Creator. He speaks to me, from time to time... Although, admittedly, it has become harder lately to separate his actual words spoken to me from my own delusions.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't try to take him too seriously,\"Kleykarth tells Hadrik. \"The poor guy's gone mad ever since he touched the Magium node a few months ago. He's been pretty much speaking in riddles ever since.\"<br/><br/> \"Not all of my words are riddles, my good man...\" the crazy guy says. \"Also, don't you think you are being rather rude to our guest? You've been speaking so loudly the whole time, that the poor fellow hasn't had the courage to utter a single word until this moment. Come now, friend, will you not do us the honor of joining our conversation? I promise that despite their looks, these are quite respectable folk, and they won't make fun of your unusual appearance!\"<br/>As he speaks, the crazy guy seems to be looking directly at one of the blue crystals from the ceiling.<br/><br/>\"What's the matter, Uverg?\" Kleykarth says, mockingly. \"Is your invisible fairy friend from the ceiling too shy to talk to us?\"<br/><br/>\"I do not think that he is a fairy...\" Uverg says, looking as if he didn't quite catch on to the lessathi guard's sarcastic tone. \"Fairies would usually not use these crystals to transfer their consciousness into them, don't you think?\"<br/><br/>",

And I assure you that your sycophants from your faction know it too. They just don't really give a damn. It's not like Heksol was a universally beloved leader either. The man definitely had his faults. I won't pretend that he didn't. But at least he had the decency to win the position of leadership fairly, without resorting to such petty tactics as murdering his competition. We will never respect you as a leader, Meridith, no matter how hard you try to maintain this illusion of diplomacy between our people. You'd better get used to that.\"<br/>\"Am I to take this as a threat?...\" Meridith asks him, cautiously.<br/><br/>\"Not at all,\" Kleykarth says. \"You see, unlike you, we from the Heksol faction would never stoop so low as to kill our own kind, just for the sake of a power struggle. We will also continue to cooperate with you whenever our goals coincide, as was the case with this mage tournament. However, if you expect to ever be on friendly terms with us in the future, then you are sorely mistaken. No matter how many times you'll try to sweet-talk our faction leader, the answer will always be the same. As long as you let us run our faction the way we want to, we can coexist peacefully. Otherwise, things might start to get a little... less peaceful. You can take THIS as a threat, if you want. I don't mind.\"<br/><br/> \"Understood,\" Meridith says. \"Then I suppose I will have no choice but to have another conversation with your faction's leader, regarding this whole Overseer situation. I can only hope that he will be more inclined to see reason than you are.\"<br/>\"Don't worry, I'm planning to have a talk with him about this too,\" Kleykarth says. \"I'm sure that he will be more than happy to welcome the Overseer with open arms, once he hears that he is a fellow Meridith hater. Oh, and I can put in a good word for you too, dwarf, if you want to join us. I don't think you'd have any trouble fitting in.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, I really appreciate the offer, buddy,\" Hadrik says, \"but I don't think I'll be spending enough time here to actually visit your part of the base. Maybe next time, eh?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I'll have to meet our leader today anyway, so I'll probably mention you to him regardless,\" Kleykarth says. \"That way at least, the paperwork will be done by the time you ever decide to visit us again. That okay with you?\"<br/><br/>\"Sure!\" Hadrik says, as he drinks some more ale. \"Sounds good to me!\"<br/><br/>\"The Overseer protocol would like to speak to your faction leader as well,\" the Overseer says. \"Would it be acceptable for me to join you when you meet him later?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course, of course,\" Kleykarth says. \"Make yourself at home. You will find that we are a very welcoming people, much unlike Meridith and her stooges.\"<br/><br/> \"That is very good to hear,\" the Overseer says. \"In that case, I look forward to a mutually beneficial and prosperous relationship between me and your people.\"<br/>\"Hahaha!\" Kleykarth laughs. \" 'Prosperous relationship', he says. Where do you even come up with this stuff? You crack me up, man!\"<br/><br/>\"Is it just me, or has the Overseer been antagonizing Meridith on purpose since the beginning, just so he could be on friendly terms with the Heksol faction?\" Kate tells me in a low voice.<br/><br/>\"That's very likely, yes,\" I whisper to her.<br/><br/>\"Has he always been this crafty?...\" Kate asks me. \"He didn't give me that impression in Ollendor.\"<br/><br/>\"He was cunning back then too,\" I tell her. \"It's just that he was making more of an effort to hide his true intentions at that point in time. Now he doesn't seem to care that much about appearances anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"If you will please excuse me, I have some other business to attend to, so I will temporarily take my leave,\" the Overseer says. \"However, I will make sure to return by the time my new friend Kleykarth meets with his leader. I wish you all a pleasant day!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey!\" Meridith says. \"I'm not done talking to you. Do you hear me? Overseer!\"<br/><br/>The crystal from above is no longer responding in any way. It looks like the Overseer really did take his departure, just like he promised.<br/><br/>",

Can you believe the nerve?\"<br/>\"What's the matter, Meridith?\" Kleykarth says. \"You don't like it when others don't listen to your orders? Does it make you feel... frustrated? Ahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>\"You are getting more and more impertinent every time you open your mouth,\" Meridith says, in a much more serious tone than before. \"Do you really want to see what happens when I get angry that badly?\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the expression on Kleykarth's face changes completely. The confidence in his eyes has disappeared, and he is now looking a lot more apprehensive. It looks like even in his drunken stupor, he is still capable of realizing when he has crossed the line.<br/><br/>\"Now, now... let's all calm down!\" Uverg says. \"I'm sure Kleykarth didn't mean what he said. It's just the alcohol speaking, that's all!\"<br/><br/>\"You are telling me to calm down, but you are the one who disappointed me the most today, Uverg,\" Meridith says. \"When everyone said that we should lock you up because you were crazy, I personally vouched for you. I assured them that despite your recent eccentric behavior, you had not taken leave of your senses, and that you were still perfectly lucid. And now you betray me like this?... You side with the Heksol faction and you agree to have a private discussion with a potential enemy that infiltrated our base? I thought you said you would remain neutral, and not join any of the factions. Was that just a lie?\"<br/><br/> \"Lady Meridith, I apologize if you feel that I've betrayed your trust,\" Uverg says, in a humble voice. \"Please believe me when I say that this was never my intention. Whether I am to meet the Overseer or not, it should be clear by now that he will be welcomed into the Heksol faction, and then any information that he might divulge will never reach your ears. However, if I befriend him and get him to tell me some of his secrets, I am more than willing to share my findings with you afterwards. While this may not be the ideal scenario that you had in mind, it is still better than the alternative. Whether you like it or not, the Overseer will infiltrate our base, and he will gain access to the Magium node. However, if we do not outright turn him into our enemy, our relationship with him could potentially become 'mutually beneficial', like he said. Of course, this will all depend on you...\"<br/>\"So, you're saying that there is truly no way to stop him?\" Meridith says. \"Do you not see any way in which we could close his connection to the crystals, or--\"<br/><br/> \"At our current level of knowledge, I'm afraid that is simply not possible,\" Uverg says. \"Even being able to detect him through the crystals might prove difficult in the future, since he is likely to find better ways to conceal his presence, now that he knows I can sense him. I understand that this might not be what you want to hear, but closing all lines of contact with him may not be in our best interest for the time being.\"<br/>\"I see...\" Meridith says, as she seems to be reflecting upon Uverg's words. \"Perhaps you are right. Maybe it's not a good idea to be too hasty with our decisions until we know exactly what we are dealing with. On that note, Barry, you said that you have dealt with the Overseer in the past... Is there perhaps some advice you could give us on how we should interact with him? Or maybe he has some sort of weakness that we could exploit?\"<br/><br/>",

Do you understand what I mean?\"<br/>\"Aaah...\" Uverg says. \"By special talents, you are talking about the knowledge that I've acquired from the Magium node? Is that correct?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, exactly!\" Meridith says. \"I'm afraid that our usual methods are simply insufficient when it comes to explaining the crystals' unusual behavior in the past few days. That's why I was counting on you and your special connection to our Creator to give us the answers we need.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Uverg says. \"Now that you mention it, I do have knowledge of a similar event happening once before, although it was over ten thousand years ago, back when the lessathi and the humans were still a single race. Would you like to hear about it?\"<br/><br/>\"Lessathi and humans used to be part of the same race?...\" Hadrik asks, shocked. \"That's the first time I'm hearing of such a thing. Is this common knowledge for you lessathi, or something?\"<br/><br/> \"No,\" Meridith says. \"This is news to me as well. Uverg, are you absolutely certain that this is indeed knowledge coming from the Magium and not just something that you're remembering from a dream?\"<br/>\"I am quite certain, Lady Meridith,\" Uverg says. \"Forgive me for not telling you about this sooner, but it sometimes gets difficult to remember what is supposed to be common knowledge, and what are obscure facts that the Magium has revealed to me alone, especially when it comes to events that happened so long ago.\"<br/><br/>\"So... correct me if I'm wrong,\" Meridith says, \"but are you claiming that the lessathi once used to be humans, and that something happened which caused us to lose all the magic in our auras?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, although it wasn't something that happened overnight,\" Uverg says. \"It is my understanding that the change between the auras of the two races was more subtle at first, and that it took several generations until the auras became so different that they could no longer be considered the same race, despite all of their other similarities.\"<br/><br/>\"This would indeed explain why we look exactly the same as the humans, but I would have never thought--\" Meridith says, as she takes a quick pause to rearrange the thoughts in her head. \"There were no mentions of this in any of our ancient scripts. Why would our ancestors lie to us about this?\"<br/><br/> \"It's most likely because our ancestors hated the humans,\" Uverg says. \"I am not entirely sure, since the memories of this distant past are vague in my head, but I believe that the regular humans and the humans who would later become the lessathi belonged to two opposing tribes. One of the tribes lived underground, worshipping the Magium nodes as deities, while the other tribe lived on the surface. I think that when the Magium nodes were originally discovered, the ancestors of the humans tricked the ancestors of the lessathi to go and investigate the underground tunnels, and then they took away the ropes that they used to climb down there, leaving them all stranded. They would later also seal the entrance, to make sure that nobody would ever find their way down there again. Our forefathers have always hated the human ancestors for doing this to them, and their hatred towards their enemies has been passed down from generation to generation, until they could finally make their escape.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"The lessathi spent the next few decades learning the ways of the humans and infiltrating their societies at the highest levels,\" Uverg says. \"The majority of our ancestors were very skilled tinkerers and inventors, thanks to the knowledge that they obtained from the Magium nodes over the years, and so it was easy for them to gain the favors of many important figures of that time. Once the lessathi managed to obtain positions of significant enough political power, they staged a coup, and they dethroned all of the human leaders, placing themselves and their kin as the new rulers. They then enslaved all of the human population and they proceeded to conquer all of the other tribes, cities or villages in the immediate vicinity. Hundreds of years later, the lessathi would form an empire so powerful that it would span across all of Varathia, although by that time, the humans were no longer their slaves. They had been freed by some of the more benevolent lessathi rulers that followed and were allowed to live peacefully inside the lessathi cities, as second-class citizens, which is what they would continue to be until the total collapse of the lessathi empire, during the still winter.\"<br/>\"Wow...\" Daren says. \"Nearly ten thousand years of treating humans as second-class citizens just because of the bad deeds of one tribe, from an age long past. Your people sure can carry a grudge, huh?\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" Uverg says. \"The lessathi do not forget easily. Even now, after all these years, this has still not changed.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, Uverg,\" Hadrik says. \"Would you mind if I asked you a personal question?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course not,\" Uverg says. \"Ask away.\"<br/><br/> \"Alright,\" Hadrik says. \"Well, from what I've seen so far, you look like a pretty smart guy, and you don't seem all that crazy to me, so I was wondering what is the reason why you dress like that?\"<br/>\"Oh, you mean why I'm not wearing dark blue robes like the rest of the lessathi in this place?\" Uverg says. \"Honestly, it's just a matter of personal preference. I've never really liked the 'uniform' that people wear around here, and Lady Meridith has been gracious enough to make an exception for me, and to allow me to wear a shirt and pants instead.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, I was more interested to know why you're wearing a boot on your head and socks on your hands,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"Oh, that!\" Uverg says. \"This is actually a social experiment that I'm doing. You see, most people who touch the Magium node like I did end up becoming quite insane, so I thought I'd try to dress up like a madman, while still acting rationally, in order to see how many people can see past the appearances and realize that I have not in fact gone completely bonkers. From what I've seen so far, there are very few people aside from Meridith who treat me as a sane person. It is always interesting to see just how many people are willing to completely ignore my arguments, no matter how well-constructed or logical, just because of the way I dress. Truly, this is a fascinating look into the depths of the human psyche, wouldn't you agree?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm, sure,\" Hadrik says. \"If that's what you enjoy doing, then who am I to judge?\"<br/><br/> \"It's not just the way you dress, Uverg,\" Meridith says. \"Your way of thinking has also changed. You were always a little eccentric, but you would have never thought of dressing like an insane person just to do a social experiment before touching the Magium node. You didn't have this kind of complete disregard for people's opinion of you before. It's hard to put into words exactly what has changed about you, but if I were to try to describe it, it's as if when you entered the Magium realm, a part of you remained there and never came back. \"<br/>\"I will have to take your word on that, Lady Meridith, since personally I do not feel all that different from how I used to be,\" Uverg says. \"From my point of view, I am the same person, only with vastly more knowledge, and with an unquenchable thirst to learn even more than I already know. If the ways in which I choose to pursue that knowledge make me seem crazy to other people, then that is a price I am willing to pay.\"<br/><br/>\"I know, Uverg,\" Meridith says, with a sigh. \"I've already come to terms with the fact that you will likely never return to your previous self, but that does not mean that I intend to reject the person that you are now. As I have said before, you are free to wear what you want and to do your research in any way you see fit, as long as the quality of your work remains as consistent as before. Now, if there isn't anything else for you to report, I would really like to discuss something in private with my guests, if you don't mind.\"<br/><br/>",

I will leave it on your desk as soon as I am able.\"<br/>\"Please do,\" Meridith says.<br/><br/>\"Farewell, guests of Meridith,\" Uverg says to us. \"It has been a pleasure!\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, nice to meet you too!\" Hadrik says, waving to Uverg as he leaves.<br/><br/>\"Strange fellow,\" Hadrik says to Meridith, once Uverg is no longer close enough to hear him. \"But I think I kind of like him.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Meridith says, as she watches Uverg walking away, in the distance. \"I feel the same way.\" <br/><br/>After a few seconds of pause, Meridith turns back towards the rest of us, so that she can finally begin the private conversation that she was trying to have all this time.<br/><br/>\"Now, then...\" Meridith says. \"It's time to tell you why I called you all here a second time. The truth is that after a discussion with Barry and Kate, I came to the conclusion that the original deal I offered you wasn't really very fair to you. As a result, I came up with a better deal for you, which I think even Hadrik might like. Allow me to give you the details.\"<br/><br/> For the next few minutes or so, Meridith tells Hadrik and the others about the deal that she offered me and Kate while we were still in the meeting room. During this whole time, Hadrik has done nothing other than to listen quietly, with a look of complete disbelief on his face. Once Meridith was done, Hadrik and the others didn't say anything for a while, as if they were still waiting for her to continue. Realizing that Meridith has nothing else to say, Hadrik finally breaks the silence, saying what everyone else was thinking.<br/>\"That's it?!\" he says, in a loud voice. \"All you want from us is to keep participating in the tournament and you'll let us use the node for free? And we don't even need to decide now if we want to fight Eiden or not? Yeah, I'm not buying it. Something smells fishy, here.\"<br/><br/>\"As I've already said, you only get access to the Magium if our plan to kill Eiden succeeds without your intervention,\" Meridith says. \"Otherwise, you will need to kill him yourselves, if you want to use the node.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, but that still means that in this case you'd be giving it to us for free!\" Hadrik says. \"You expect me to believe that the Magium is of so little importance to you that you just hand it out to everyone you meet? I pretty much already told you that I'm not planning to help kill Eiden while he's weakened, because it would be dishonorable. This means that you have nothing to gain from me. You're saying that you'd still have no problem giving me access to the Magium under these conditions?\"<br/><br/> \"Actually, I do have something to gain from you,\" Meridith says. \"As long as you keep travelling with your friends for the remainder of the tournament, then you will be protecting them from danger, and there are some good chances that at least some of them will agree to help us kill Eiden by the end of the tournament. In any case, I don't think you understand just how important this goal is to us. Killing Eiden has been the desire of our people for six hundred years. I would be a fool not to use every means at my disposal, when I've come so close to finally achieving the dreams of our ancestors.\"<br/>\"Hmm...\" Hadrik says. \"Well, deal or no deal, I am still planning to keep participating in the tournament, even if the prize is fake, since I came here for the adventure, not the Magium. If you want to give me access to your node just for doing what I was already going to do, then sure, why not? What have I got to lose?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm glad to hear you say that,\" Meridith says. \"Is it safe to assume that everyone else also agrees with Hadrik?\"<br/><br/>\"Sure, I suppose,\" Daren says, as Illuna also nods her head in the background. \"As long as you don't make us promise anything about Eiden, I have no problem with the rest of your deal. I'm pretty sure the rest of us also feel the same way.\"<br/><br/>",

I didn't think there were even any useful spells before getting your second level in your stats.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, there are a lot of useful spells here, trust me,\" I tell Meridith. \"Sure, they're not all that good individually, but there are some pretty lethal combinations if you know what you're doing. I've only just begun skimming the list of available spells, and I'm already amazed by their level of variety. This is going to keep me busy for days!\"<br/><br/>\"Then I suppose I made the right choice by unlocking these stats for you,\" Meridith says. \"I hope you will find a way to unleash their full potential.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sure I will,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Now, can you please come down from there?\" Meridith says. \"I would prefer it if we all entered the Magium node room at the same time.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah, of course,\" I say, and then I drop back to the floor in a very inelegant fashion.<br/><br/> \"Splendid,\" Meridith says, as she now taps the wall in front of her with her wand, so that it will open our way to the Magium node room.<br/>We all make our way back inside the room with the big blue sphere, and as we get closer to it, Meridith pulls out a small device with a lot of varicolored buttons on it, which looks somewhat similar in design to my stat booster.<br/><br/>\"This is what we call a 'Magium connector',\" Meridith says, as she shows the device to all of us. \"You will be using it to interact with the node. Since you are only beginners, I recommend simply pressing on the green button for now. The red button should only be used by people who have interacted with the Magium at least a few times before, as it can get disorienting for a beginner.

Why, did you want to speak with him again?\"<br/><br/>\"Quite the contrary, in fact,\" Illuna says. \"Did you hear that, Arraka? The Magium fragment isn't here. You can stop fidgeting now.\"<br/><br/>\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" Arraka says. \"How would I even be 'fidgeting' inside of an amulet without any body to speak of?\"<br/><br/>\"Your aura was getting more and more restless the closer we got to the Magium node room,\" Illuna says. \"To be honest, it was getting a little annoying.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, so you're an expert on auras, now?\" Arraka says. \"Maybe you'd like to give me some tips too, while we're at it?\"<br/><br/>\"Whatever you say, Arraka,\" Iluna tells her.<br/><br/>",

It's time for me to give you your pinecone detector, so you can be on your way.\"<br/>\"FINALLY!\" Arraka says, in a loud voice. \"I was starting to get really tired of this place.\"<br/><br/>\"Did Diane have the time to give you the good news?\" Meridith asks us, ignoring Arraka.<br/><br/>\"You mean that she'll be coming with us to the sacred woods and to Galamir?\" Kate says. \"Yes, she told us.\"<br/><br/>\"Splendid!\" Meridith says. \"Normally, I wouldn't have agreed, since her detour with you may delay her for a few days, but from what I've heard, the other diplomatic envoys will also be late, so there's not much point for Diane, of all people, to arrive there the earliest. Let's head towards the teleporter. I've hidden the pinecone detector inside a wall, somewhere on the way.\"<br/><br/>\"Sorry if I'm being indiscrete, but diplomatic envoy for what?\" Daren says, as we are heading back to the teleporter, together with Meridith. \"What is Diane going there to do?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch11_diane || 0) == 2) {%> \"Oh, you haven't heard?\" Meridith says, surprised. \"The dragon, Tyrath, has declared war on every living being on the continent that isn't a monster. At first, he was going to send his armies directly towards the cities of Varathia, but the orc captain of his elite troops has apparently managed to convince him to at least hold some negotiations before the war. Knowing Tyrath, his terms will probably be something along the lines of us dropping all our defenses so his forces can butcher us, but at least we'll have some more time to prepare before the inevitable conflict.\"<br/>\"So, Diane is the envoy on behalf of the lessathi, and I'm assuming the orc captain will be Tyrath's envoy,\" Daren says, while stroking his chin. \"Do you have any idea who will be the other delegates?\"<br/><br/>\"The golden fox will most likely be sending Leo the leopard,\" Meridith says, as she opens a secret tunnel with her wand. \"I heard that the dragons from the mountains will also be sending their own separate envoy, since they've never really accepted Tyrath's claim to be their rightful king. Oh, and I think Fyron, the goblin general, will be attending the meeting himself, if I'm not mistaken. Other than that, I believe that the king of Galamir will be the one mediating the conference, and that the other kings should normally be attending the meeting through holographic screens.\"<br/><br/>\"Looks like there will be a lot of familiar faces at this meeting,\" Daren says. \"We've all met Leo the leopard and the orc captain, and I'm pretty sure Barry said he and Illuna met Fyron, so the only ones we won't know there will be the kings of Varathia and the representative of the dragons. Maybe we'll have a chance to meet some of them in Galamir.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Somehow, I doubt that this is a coincidence. Is Galamir the capital of Varathia by any chance?\"<br/><br/> \"No, it's not the capital, but you are correct in assuming that it's not just some regular kingdom,\" Meridith says. \"Out of all the monarchs of Varathia, the king of Galamir is by far the one with the most influence over the other rulers from this continent. Whether it is by blackmail, by subtle manipulation or simply through diplomacy, this particular king has managed to bring many of the other kingdoms under his control, despite them being officially independent. On that note, you should be very careful how you behave while you are in Galamir. You were lucky that the last noble you killed happened to be from a kingdom that nobody cared about, but if you were to bring harm to any of the nobles in Galamir, you would almost certainly be kicked out of the tournament and teleported away from this continent in the very next minute, and I don't think any of us would want that.\"<br/>\"I see...\" Daren says. \"Thanks for the warning.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not sure if I should even bother asking at this point,\" Meridith says, \"but is it safe to assume that Eiden was the one who gave you the ability to harm the locals of Varathia?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" I answer her. \"He did it right after we met the Earl of Ollendor in Thilias.\"<br/><br/> \"Of course he did...\" Meridith says, in an exhausted tone, as she now opens another hidden tunnel with the aid of her wand.<br/>\"Speaking of Eiden,\" I say, while we are entering the corridor, \"you never did tell us what his message for you meant.

After all, there is only an entire continent's fate lying in the balance!\"<br/><br/>\"Continent?\" I ask him. \"Don't you mean island?\"<br/><br/>\"You know, Barry...\" Eiden says, as he now turns to look at me with his closed eyes. \"I'm beginning to think that the real reason why I keep coming back to visit your group is because I've grown fond of hearing your wildly inappropriate and impertinent remarks. I should probably thank you for bringing some color into the otherwise dull and uninteresting experience that I've had since I've returned to Varathia.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, you're welcome,\" I say. \"Always happy to help!\"<br/><br/> \"Indeed...\" Eiden says, and then he stays quiet for a few moments, to ponder on his next words.<br/>\"Very well, then,\" Eiden tells us, after a while. \"Like Meridith, I too shall await your answer to her offer with great interest. Until then, we will continue to interact in the same way as before. The next time we will be meeting each other will likely be in Galamir. I look forward to seeing how you will handle yourselves in the rather... unique scenario that you will be encountering inside that city. Goodbye, for now.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, see you,\" I say, as Eiden finally teleports away.<br/><br/>",

I will tell you if he's still hiding.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Is this how you guys interact with Eiden all the time?\" Diane asks us, looking genuinely puzzled. \"You all seemed so... casual about it.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, you get used to it after some time,\" Daren says. \"So, which way was it we were going again?\"<br/><br/>\"Uh... that way!\" Diane says. \"The nearest sacred woods should be within a few days' walking distance of here if we keep heading in that general direction.\"<br/><br/> \"Alright, let's go, then,\" Daren says.<br/>\"Of course,\" Diane tells him. \"Follow me.\"<br/><br/>As we followed Diane further into the woods, my thoughts very quickly began to drift away from Meridith, Eiden and his message, because to me at least, there were far more important things to think about.<br/><br/> My magical stats are working, and I also now know for a fact that there is a way to extract knowledge from the Magium without the risk of being erased from existence or becoming insane. All of a sudden, Kate's suggestion of me using knowledge from the Magium to modify my stat device into extracting its energy directly from the magical plane does not seem so far-fetched anymore.<br/>This is quite possibly the closest I've ever been to realizing my lifelong dream. Maybe this wasn't so impossible after all.<br/><br/>Maybe... I can become a mage.<br/><br/>",
