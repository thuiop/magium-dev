We're all ears.\"<br/><br/>\"Good!\" Melindra says. \"Although, to be honest, I don't really know a lot more than you do. I haven't spent that much time in Ollendor, and it's been quite a few years since I was exiled from this continent, so a lot of things may have changed since then.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, right, I almost forgot that this was the reason why you wanted the king of Ollendor dead,\" Hadrik says. \"What did you do to get yourself kicked out of Varathia, anyway? Didn't you say that you were born here?\"<br/><br/>\"That is... a personal matter,\" Melindra says. \"I'd rather not talk about it, unless it's absolutely necessary.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Daren says. \"I still can't help but think that there's something important you're not telling us about your reason for coming back here. You don't seem like the kind of person who would go through all this trouble just for petty revenge. There has to be another reason why you would want to kill the king of this city.\"<br/><br/>\"You're right,\" Melindra says. \"There is another reason. In short, the king of Ollendor has stolen something very important from me, and I want it back. However, this isn't something that you should concern yourselves with. All you need to do is help me kill him. I will handle the rest by myself.\"<br/><br/> \"I see...\" Daren says. \"Well, as long as you uphold your end of the bargain, we will try not to meddle in your affairs, then. Whatever they are...\"<br/>\"What about Ollendor's defenses?\" Kate says. \"Isn't there anything you remember that could be of use to us? Perhaps some obscure weaknesses that could help us fight those golems at least?\"<br/><br/>\"The only thing I know is that these technological advancements are all relatively recent,\" Melindra says. \"A few decades ago, the king has allied himself with a rogue lessathi, and it is thanks to him that they've managed to turn those old lessathi ruins into something functional. Those metal golems that you saw outside were also designed by him. The reason why I wanted you to see them with your own eyes before making our plans to infiltrate the city was because I wanted you to take their defenses seriously. We can't afford to just smash through their front gates and fight our way through. We need to keep a low profile for as long as possible. That being said, we're almost definitely going to have to fight our way out after we assassinate their king, so you should also prepare yourselves mentally for our inevitable fight against those golems when we escape the city.\"<br/><br/>",

We'll say that you came here to trade some of your enchanted goods, and that the rest of us are your bodyguards or something. That should be enough of a reason for the guards at the entrance to let us in. And my exile was kept a secret from anyone but the king's most trusted advisors, so we shouldn't be worried about the guards not letting us in because of me.\"<br/><br/>\"I think you may be forgetting the small matter of us killing the earl of Ollendor, back in Thilias,\" Hadrik says. \"I know that we've technically served our sentence with that arena and that we have the papers from Golmyck to prove it, but something tells me that this won't really stop the king of this city from executing us for murdering his brother.\"<br/><br/> \"He won't execute you if he doesn't even know that his brother is dead, yet!\" Melindra says. \"Believe me, if the king knew about the earl's death, the whole town would be in mourning. Those walls would be covered in black banners, and there would be paintings of the earl's face placed on posters all around the small village outside the city. Considering how normal everything seems to be, I think it's safe to assume that the ambassador has not sent any of his emissaries to let the king know of his brother's death, and he wanted to tell him of this personally, when he got back. Except we got here first, since we took a shortcut through the monster-infested forests! It will probably be at least another day until the ambassador reaches the city the regular way, so until then, you'll be just some random tournament participants that shouldn't be raising any suspicion.\"<br/><br/>",

And if we just ask someone in public for the password, someone will surely overhear our conversation and report us to the guards.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry about it,\" Hadrik says. \"I know exactly how we can get someone to drink with us in private. But we can't go as a group, because we'd look too intimidating, especially with Daren walking alongside us. I'd say me and Barry should be enough to get the job done. What do you say, Barry? Are you ready to go hit up the local tavern?\"<br/><br/>\"Sure, I'm game,\" I say. \"Lead the way.\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect!\" Hadrik says. \"Let's get going. The rest of you should stay here, until we're done. We'll contact you through the transceivers as soon as we'll know the password.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't forget to call us if anything unexpected happens!\" Daren says. \"We won't be able to tell if you're in trouble from all the way over here.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, yeah, we'll call you if anything comes up,\" Hadrik says. \"I'm sure we'll be fine, though.\"<br/><br/> As Hadrik and I head out of the forest, we both look around, trying to figure out where the tavern is. Since there are no clear signs leading to it, Hadrik decides to ask one of the locals for directions.<br/>\"Hey, excuse me!\" Hadrik asks a man who was sitting on a bench in his yard. \"Would you mind telling us where your village's tavern is? Me and my friend could really go for a drink right about now!\"<br/><br/>The villager stares at Hadrik with an absent-minded look on his face for a few seconds, and then he gets up from his bench and walks into his house, closing the door behind him without saying a word.<br/><br/>\"I guess he wasn't really the talkative sort, eh?\" Hadrik tells me.<br/><br/>He then turns around to address another man, who was busy digging up his front yard with a spade, in order to plant some seeds.<br/><br/>\"Sir, excuse me!\" Hadrik says. \"Would you happen to know where the local tavern is?\"<br/><br/>The man stops from his work to look at Hadrik, and he nods his head curtly in the direction of the tavern. He then goes back to his digging, without paying any more attention to us.<br/><br/>\"Well... I guess now we know which way to go, then,\" Hadrik says, looking a bit confused by the reactions of the villagers towards us. \"Let's get a drink.\"<br/><br/> It doesn't take us long to find the tavern, after following the directions from that villager. Even though it wasn't written anywhere on the building that it was a tavern, we could see people walk out of it who were barely able to stand on their feet and who smelled strongly of alcohol, so there was no mistaking it.<br/>We both enter the tavern and once we reach the counter, Hadrik immediately asks the bartender for the strongest alcoholic beverage they have on their menu. At first, the bartender didn't notice him, because the counter wasn't really built for dwarves so it was a little taller than Hadrik, but once he realized who was making the order, he poured him his drink in a wooden mug.<br/><br/>\"That's your strongest drink?\" Hadrik shouts, after drinking all of the alcohol in a single gulp. \"I swear, you people outside the dwarven lands have no idea how to enjoy yourselves! Here, let me show you what real alcohol tastes like!\"<br/><br/>He then takes a bottle of dwarven ale out of his backpack, and he stretches his arm up, so he can put it on the counter.<br/><br/>\"See this?\" Hadrik says, to the bartender. \"This is dwarven ale! I guarantee you that you've never tasted anything better. Come on, have a taste! I've got plenty more of these in my backpack.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to bring your own drinks to this tavern,\" the bartender says, in a cold tone. \"If you want to drink your dwarven ale, then you can go outside.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yeah?\" Hadrik says, as he takes his bottle back. \"Well, maybe I will, then.\"<br/><br/>",

We will most certainly be seeing at least one guy coming out to look for us in the next few seconds.\"<br/><br/>Just as soon as Hadrik stops talking, a middle-aged man that looks like a real heavy drinker walks out of the tavern, and he looks all around, to see if we've already left or not. Once the drunkard spots us, he immediately heads in our direction, and as he comes closer to us, the strong smell of alcohol from his breath is becoming increasingly harder to ignore.<br/><br/>\"There we go!\" Hadrik tells me, with a grin.<br/><br/>\"So, uh...\" the drunkard says, as he stops in front of us. \"I heard you were willing to share that dwarven ale? Can I have a taste, or...?\"<br/><br/> \"Tell you what...\" Hadrik says, after he drinks from his bottle again. \"For you, I'll make an exception and give you an entire bottle for free. What do you say?\"<br/>\"An entire bottle of dwarven ale?\" the drunkard says, unable to contain his excitement. \"That's... mighty generous of you!\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, well it's your reward for choosing us over that insufferable bartender of yours,\" Hadrik says, as he takes out another bottle of ale from his backpack and hands it to the middle-aged man. \"Here you go. But let's not drink here. I'm not in the mood for that moron to come and complain that we're drinking on his front porch. Let's find some place more quiet, where we can properly enjoy this fine beverage without being disturbed by anyone.\"<br/><br/>\"I know just the place!\" the drunkard says, after he takes a drink from the dwarven ale bottle. \"Follow me!\"<br/><br/>\"We're right behind you, buddy!\" Hadrik says, as he grins at me, and then we both go to follow the drunkard to a more secluded location.<br/><br/>About five minutes of walking later, the drunkard stops in front of an empty house with broken windows. As we follow him inside, we realize that this building has likely been abandoned a long time ago, since it is filled with dust and spider webs, and it doesn't even have any furniture left.<br/><br/>Given that there are no beds or chairs we can sit on, the drunkard sits himself on the floor with his back leaning against one of the walls, while Hadrik and I follow his example and also sit on the floor in front of him, in a cross-legged position.<br/><br/> \"This house used to be inhabited by a family of mages,\" the drunkard tells us. \"But it's empty now. Been this way for a while. I think it was one year ago... maybe two?... The mages just disappeared in the middle of the night and nobody has heard of them since. When we asked the guards what happened with the father and the three sons who used to live in this house, we were told to stop asking questions. So we stopped asking questions. Anyway, I figured that nobody would bother us here, since everyone's already stolen everything that could be stolen, and it's not like the house's owners are going to come back now, after all this time. Cheers!\"<br/>\"Uh... cheers!\" Hadrik says, as we all clink our bottles and then take a sip from them.<br/><br/>\"This drink is... really strong!\" the drunkard says. \"I've only just started drinking, and I'm already feeling a bit drowsy.\"<br/><br/>\"Heh!\" Hadrik says. \"I guess drinking dwarven ale right after another type of alcohol will have that effect on you, if you're not used to it. Don't worry about it. Even if you can't finish that bottle with us now, I'll still let you keep it.\"<br/><br/>\"I never said I couldn't finish it!\" the drunkard says, as he now takes a longer sip from his bottle. \"Don't underestimate me, dwarf. I've been going to taverns since I was a wee lad. I won't lose to some 'dwarven ale', no matter how strong it is!\"<br/><br/>\"That's the spirit!\" Hadrik says, as he takes a drink as well.<br/><br/>",

Do you think they got arrested or something? How often do people in this village disappear out of the blue, anyway?\"<br/>\"In the village, it doesn't happen all that often, but I'm not so sure about the city,\" the drunkard says. \"I've been hearing lots of stories about people in there disappearing out of the blue, especially in the most recent years, and nobody knows what's happening. These are dark times we're living in, I'll tell you that. I don't know what you came here to accomplish, but I recommend you finish your business quickly and get out while you can. There's nothing good waiting for you in this place.\"<br/><br/>\"Sadly, we might not even make it past the city gates, judging by how things have been going so far,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"How so?\" the drunkard asks, as he takes another drink from his bottle.<br/><br/>\"Well, there was this guy who invited us here so we could trade with him,\" Hadrik says, \"but he forgot to tell us that we needed a password to enter the city, and now we can't contact him anymore for some reason. We're just stuck waiting in front of the city, after we spent all that time to get here. That guard at the entrance said he'd commence some sort of procedure so we could receive permission to enter the city, but I don't trust a word of what he says. I bet he didn't even tell anyone that we're here, and he's just waiting for us to go away. What a waste of time this whole trip turned out to be...\"<br/><br/> \"You can't get into the city?...\" the drunkard says. \"That's a real shame. And after you spent so much time to get here too...\"<br/>He pauses for a little, as he stares in front of him with a thoughtful look on his face.<br/><br/>\"Yes... It would be a real shame if you couldn't get into the city just because of some dumb password,\" the drunkard says. \"I don't know why they made up such a stupid rule. It's not like we even have that many visitors. Why would we turn away the few people that come here, just for the sake of 'security'? I'll tell you why they're asking for a password. It's because the king's lost it, that's why! He sees enemies everywhere. Even in his own city.\"<br/><br/>The man pauses again, as he takes another long drink from his bottle, and then he gazes in front of him again, this time with a more determined look in his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Tell you what,\" the drunkard says, as he now turns to us. \"I'll give you that password. I'd feel bad for you if you had to go back to your homeland empty-handed at this point, and you did give me this bottle of ale for free, after all!\"<br/><br/>\"You sure about that?\" Hadrik asks him. \"Won't the guards be upset with you if they find out?\"<br/><br/> \"To hell with the guards and with the king!\" the drunkard says, as he drinks again, and his face becomes a lot more red than before. \"It's not like anybody's going to die just because of some harmless password. Just... make sure you don't tell anyone that you got it from me! I don't want to go to jail over something as trivial as this!\"<br/>\"Of course, of course...\" Hadrik says. \"We'll just say that we managed to contact our client, and he gave us the password through the transceiver.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, then!\" the drunkard says. \"In that case, the password for this week is 'gargoyle wings'. Oh, and last week's was 'broken oars', in case they ask. This should be enough to get you through the front gates.\"<br/><br/>\"Wow, that's great!\" Hadrik says. \"Thanks a bunch! I can't wait to see the looks on our friends' faces when we'll tell them that we managed to find out the password!\"<br/><br/>\"You can go tell them right now, I won't mind!\" the drunkard says. \"You don't need to worry about this old drunkard.

I wouldn't put it past that guy to let us in only to lure us into a trap.\" <br/>\"Yeah, exactly!\" Hadrik says. \"That's what I was thinking! See? Barry gets it!\"<br/><br/>\"Are you guys forgetting about those giant fire-breathing golems that are patrolling in front of the city walls?...\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Come on...\" Hadrik says. \"They're just metal golems. How tough can they be? No matter how durable their metal hide is, with my strength I could still send them flying with one punch, and those fire beams they were shooting out of their mouths were clearly made of magical fire, so Daren would be able to both defend us from them with his shield and absorb the flames with his sword. And while we'd be hiding inside Daren's magical barrier, the two of us could send their flames right back at them, while Kate, Flower and Illuna would shoot their own elemental magic towards them.\"<br/><br/> \"You do realize that those golems likely have anti-magic armor, don't you?\" Daren says.<br/>\"If I had enough time to reinforce my icicles properly, I could probably penetrate their armor, even if it has anti-magic protection,\" Kate says. \"Also, the impact from Flower's fireballs and Illuna's water jets can still do reasonable damage, even against anti-magic armor.  Besides, it's not like we need to hold them off for long. Once we make it into the city I'm sure the golems won't be able to follow us, because they'd be wreaking too much havoc and would put civilians' lives at risk.\"<br/><br/>\"It's settled, then!\" Hadrik says. \"The first thing I'll do is destroy the gates, and then we'll advance slowly towards it, while hiding under the protection of Daren's magical barrier. Daren, you can still move while holding the barrier up, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, but we'd need to move really slowly...\" Daren says. \"Otherwise the protection spell would break, and I'd need to cast it again.

After all, I won't be able to attack any of the locals, so it's the least I can do to make myself useful. The rest of you should concentrate on making it safely inside the city, while I have the golems' undivided attention.\"<br/><br/>\"Great!\" I say. \"In that case, the ones of us who can attack the locals will deal with the city guards.

Remember when I suggested yesterday that we should have Flower send fireballs over their walls, so we could burn their houses down and smoke them out like the rats they are, but nobody paid any attention to me? If you would have backed me up then, you might have had my vote of confidence now, but it's too late for that. You already blew your chance!\"<br/><br/> \"All jokes aside, we're kinda going to need a unanimous vote on this one,\" Hadrik says. \"We're all putting our lives at stake here, so everyone who is not completely on board with this plan should mull it over for a bit, because once we've gone through those gates there's no going back. Maybe we should take a small break to clear our heads, and then we'll continue our discussion from where we left off. I'm sure we'll find a plan that everyone agrees on, eventually.\"<br/>We all listened to Hadrik's advice and took a short break, in order to leave ourselves a bit of time to more calmly assess the situation. In the end, we managed to convince Daren to go through with our plan, even though he was still somewhat reluctant. We did, however, have to promise him that we'd do our best to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed and that we'd try to avoid killing the city guards as much as possible, since it wasn't their fault that they were being forced to follow their king's orders and they were only doing their jobs of defending their city from invaders.<br/><br/>Once we've all agreed on our course of action, we begin to walk out of the forest and to head back towards the main road.

I usually ignore voices that are in the background because it's too difficult to focus on what each individual person is saying, but if I concentrate really hard I should be able to tell if someone is planning to head for the city gates, and then I'll be able to get a little closer.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, don't strain yourself too much,\" Daren says. \"We wouldn't want you to tire yourself out before we even begin infiltrating the city.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I know,\" I say. \"I won't go overboard.

I spend the next few minutes trying to concentrate on hearing what each individual person is saying, although given how many people seem to be talking at the same time, this is by no means an easy task. Most of the conversations are about mundane stuff, which is not useful to me in any way, though I can't help but notice that most of the people are talking in a very tired tone and that almost all of them seem to have a very pessimistic attitude, no matter the subject of discussion.<br/>Sometimes, an isolated husband would vent his frustration towards the king or the city guards to his wife, but then he would stop suddenly, out of fear that someone might overhear him. Otherwise, the discussions of the villagers revolved mainly around their daily activities, and they wouldn't really talk about much else.<br/><br/>",

It doesn't take me that long to figure out who it was, because not far from me, I can already see a guy pulling a small wooden cart behind him who is heading in the direction of the city. I pretend to look around for a signpost while I give the man with the cart enough time to distance himself from me, and then I begin to slowly walk in the direction of the city as well, to make sure that I don't let the man walk out of my hearing range.<br/><br/> As soon as the man reaches the gates, the guard asks him for the password, and the villager responds to him with: 'gargoyle wings'. This was apparently the correct answer, since the gates in the distance are now opening and the golems are moving aside, to make way for the man to pass. Once the gates close back up, I pull out my transceiver and set it to Daren's frequency, so I can tell him what I found out.<br/>\"Hey, Daren, can you hear me?\" I tell him, as I begin to head back in the direction of the forest.<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" Daren says. \"What happened?

If you're interested, then come back inside the forest, and we can talk.\"<br/>As I try to figure out who is speaking to us, I realize that I can sense some very weak and heavily suppressed auras coming from behind the trees, although I would have had no chance to notice that they were there without knowing in advance where to look for them. Judging by their sizes and by the sound of that broken accent from earlier, my assumption is that we are dealing with a group of goblins.<br/><br/>\"Arraka...\" Illuna says. \"Why didn't you notify us that we were being followed by goblins?\"<br/><br/>\"What kind of question is that?\" Arraka says. \"Do you also want me to tell you about the squirrels in the trees and the birds in the sky? You asked me to tell you about enemies that might try to surround you, and that's what I've been doing. These goblins are obviously harmless. They're barely armed, and you can see for yourself how weak their auras are. If I stopped to tell you about every single animal or monster in your vicinity, we'd never get anywhere.\"<br/><br/> \"But were they already in the area when we arrived, or did they follow us here?\" Illuna asks.<br/>\"The goblins have been following us since earlier this morning,\" Melindra says. \"I thought everybody knew about them by now. It didn't seem like they wanted to fight, so I just let them be.\"<br/><br/>\"And how exactly do you know that they are not scouts of Tyrath?\" Daren says, in a low voice, in order to make sure that the goblins cannot hear him. \"They could have been leaking information about our location to the dragon for all this time!\"<br/><br/>\"So what?\" Melindra says, now lowering her voice as well. \"Tyrath's elite troops have already proven to you that they can find you no matter where you hide, scouts or no. How does letting a few goblins live make any significant difference?\"<br/><br/>\"Humans...\" the goblin's voice calls to us again, from inside the forest. \"Are you coming or not?\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " Four beams of fire hit Daren's barrier at once, generating an explosion of hot air that can be somewhat felt even by the ones of us who are inside. It doesn't look like the golems can move while they're firing their beams at us, so at least they won't be able to get any closer to us unless they cancel their attacks. Meanwhile, Hadrik has begun to assault the second golem by the gates, but he is having a little more trouble with it than with the first one. The golem seems strong enough to push Hadrik back, and since he can't risk getting hit by any of the beams, the dwarf is being forced to fight in a somewhat more evasive style than usually.<br/>\"Kate, could you take one or two of the golems out?\" Daren says, as the air inside the barrier is slowly getting hotter. \"I can't move the barrier while it's being assaulted by so many beams at once.\"<br/><br/>\"Unfortunately, I'm already too busy with defending us from the rain of arrows coming from above,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>As we look upwards, we see that Kate is controlling several flying platforms of ice that are constantly moving to intercept the crossbow bolts and arrows coming from the guards stationed on top of the walls.<br/><br/> \"Unless you've suddenly learned to make barriers against non-magic attacks, dismissing those ice platforms will mean our deaths,\" Kate says. \"Somebody else will need to focus on attacking the golems.\"<br/>\"Damn it, you're right!\" Daren says.<br/><br/>He then sticks his sword out of the barrier in order to start absorbing one of the fire beams, and once the sword becomes flaming hot, he swings it with full force back towards the golem that shot it. The beam from Daren's sword and the one coming from the golem collide with each other, and they create an explosion of air powerful enough that it knocks the golem off its feet and it also makes a small crack in Daren's semi-transparent barrier.<br/><br/>\"Flower and I will go deal with the guards on the walls,\" Illuna says, while the golem that fell earlier is in the process of getting back up.<br/><br/>\"Make sure not to kill them!\" Daren says. \"Remember, it's not their fault. They're only defending their city!\"<br/><br/>\"Right...\" Illuna says, as she steps out of the barrier, jumps into the air, and then Flower turns on her fire jets.<br/><br/>\"You have the flying spell, Barry,\" Melindra says, as I suddenly feel her air currents rotating around my body. \"Do with it as you see fit.\"<br/><br/>",

My plan seems to be working, as the golems have immediately stopped using their beam attacks, in order to avoid hurting their own troops by accident, and they are now simply looking at me without doing anything. I make sure to maintain the exact same level of height and I begin flying horizontally, shooting the crossbowmen in their legs one at a time, while also dodging the crossbow bolts that they're shooting at me. When they realize that I'm not planning to move away from their allies, the two golems that were shooting at me decide to switch their targets, and to go after Hadrik, who is already done with the golem at the gate and is now rushing towards one of the others.<br/>In the meantime Daren, who now has less fire attacks focusing him, can finally move with his barrier a little, so he is heading slowly for the gates, along with Kate, Leila and Melindra. As Illuna and I deal with a few more of the crossbowmen and archers, Kate decides that she can now dismiss some of her defensive ice platforms, and she is focusing on reinforcing a large icicle in the sky, making sure that the projectile is strong enough to go through the golems' anti-magical armor.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_perception || 0) == 4 && (locals.v_b3_ch1_unlock || 0) != 2) {%> <br/>\"I'll go help Illuna,\" I say. \"The sooner we deal with the crossbowmen, the better.\"<br/><br/>I take the crossbow out of my backpack, I raise my arms in the air in order to tell the air currents that I want to go up, and then I begin heading above the walls, so I can get a good view of my enemies.

With the tail of my eye, I somehow manage to see another golem readying his fire beam from behind me, which gives me just enough time to fly out of its way and to avoid death by a mere few inches.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_perception || 0) == 4 && (locals.v_b3_ch1_unlock || 0) != 2) {%> After we incapacitate a few more of the crossbowmen, Kate shoots her giant icicle with an incredible force, causing an explosion of air behind it and going straight through one of the golems' heads, immediately sending it falling to the ground with a loud thud. At the same time, Hadrik also finishes off another one of the golems and he is moving on to his fourth.<br/>Unfortunately, while we were busy dealing with the few golems that were near enough to engage us immediately, about a dozen more large golems that heard the commotion have been slowly getting closer to us, and they will soon be within firing range of their beam attacks. As Hadrik grabs the attention of one of the two golems that are close enough to attack us, and the last golem who was attacking Daren's barrier begins to target Illuna and Flower instead, Daren and the others quickly rush out of the barrier towards the gates, and they call out to us as soon as they reach them.<br/><br/>\"Over here!\" Daren shouts to us. \"Leave the golems and come here!

I waste no time and I pull out my dagger, jumping on the golem's face and stabbing one of its eyes with my weapon as hard as I can. The metal construct makes some very strange noises and it fails to lift itself back up, which makes me think that my attacks are working, so I pull my dagger out of the eye socket and stab my enemy in the other eye as well.  Seeing that the golem is still not dead, I twist my blade a little harder inside, until my opponent stops moving completely.<br/>As I turn around to see what the others are doing, I notice that Hadrik has already dealt with the golem at the gates and that he is now heading towards one of the others.

Seeing that they are no longer being targeted by any of the fire beams, Daren and the others quickly take advantage of this opportunity to make a rush for the city gates, while Hadrik manages to finish off yet another golem, now moving on to his fourth.<br/>Unfortunately, it seems that while we were busy dealing with the few golems that were near enough to engage us immediately, about a dozen more large golems that heard the commotion have been slowly getting closer to us, and they will soon be within firing range of their beam attacks.<br/><br/>\"Over here!\" Daren shouts to us, as soon as he and the others reach the gates. \"Leave the golems and come here!

        "text": " Illuna, Hadrik and I do exactly as Daren says, and we head towards the gates as quickly as we can. Almost immediately after we go past the large broken doors, the two remaining golems close to us shoot their beams at the same time, while Daren readies his shield and makes another barrier. The two beams of fire meet each other and create another big explosion, sending some rubble flying our way, which is quickly taken care of by Hadrik with a few punches.<br/>As we head further into the city, the golems seem to have abandoned pursuit, likely so that they don't risk causing too much collateral damage to the townspeople with their devastating attacks.<br/><br/>\"What now, then?\" Kate asks us, as we move past several groups of frightened citizens, who apparently came near the gates to see what the commotion was about. \"Do we look for a place to hide, or do we keep going forward?\"<br/><br/>\"Considering that we've already gotten this far, it's probably a better idea to head directly for the palace,\" Daren says. \"The longer we wait, the more time we give them to organize themselves. Melindra, do you know in which general direction the palace should be?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Melindra says. \"If the layout of the city is still the same as it was before they banished me, the shortest route would be to go through the Perrelion plaza. Follow me.\"<br/><br/> Melindra takes the lead and we all go after her, while more and more curious citizens are getting out of their houses and heading towards the city's entrance, to see what happened. In contrast, the people that are flying in the metal vehicles above the city seem to be minding their own business, and they're not paying any attention to what happens below them.<br/>\"Leila, do you have any means of communicating with your father?\" Daren says. \"Can you let him know we're here?\"<br/><br/>\"No...\" Leila writes. \"He did not have any items with him when we were escaping Thilias together, so I can't call him on a transceiver. Before we got separated, he promised me that when I would reach Ollendor, he would find a way to contact me no matter what, but I don't know how long it will take him to become aware of my arrival.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry,\" Daren says. \"With all the ruckus that we will be causing inside the city soon, I'm sure that he'll find his way to us eventually.\"<br/><br/>\"Let's hope you are right!\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>As we advance through the city, I notice that most of the houses have a very strange style of architecture, unlike most regular buildings that you would expect to see in a typical city. Some of the houses have more than four floors and are built in an oval shape. Some of them are built entirely out of glass. Others are made from metal, coated with seredium dust. It's pretty hard to find two houses that look exactly the same, and several of the buildings honestly look like whoever designed them was just messing around.<br/><br/>",
