Then one night...\"<br/>I start getting flashbacks of the night when my sister turned into a banshee. It feels as if her sinister laughter is still ringing in my ears.<br/><br/>\"One night, I came home to find the bodies of my parents lying in pools of blood, with my sister standing above them. Only it wasn't my sister anymore. Everything was different about her, even her magical aura. She was just about to kill my younger brother, when I picked a pitchfork from the ground, and impaled her with it. I was lucky. The banshee had just awakened, which made her vulnerable. If I had arrived even a few minutes later, I don't think anyone would have been able to stop her anymore.\"<br/><br/>I pause, and then look Kate straight in the eye.<br/><br/> \"Daren's transceiver is made so that I can let him know when I'm in danger by simply tapping it three times. I could have done that the moment you put your dagger to my throat, but I didn't, for the same reason I didn't refuse to go alone with you in these woods, despite the obvious risks. It's because I wanted to talk things through with you, and make sure that we clear things up between us. Now, tell me, Kate, do you still think I'm saying all of this just so I can gain your trust in order to capture or assassinate you?\"<br/>Kate's hand holding the dagger is starting to tremble, and the fierce determination she had in her eyes is slowly dying down. She lowers her dagger, and her gaze turns towards the ground on her left side.<br/><br/>\"No, I don't,\" she answers me. \"I'm... really sorry. For everything...\"<br/><br/>",

His defensive barrier seems to be holding up a lot better than it usually does against normal weapons. None of Kate's ice swords are getting through it, even though she's attacking him from all directions.<br/><br/>Daren is now raising his sword into the air,  and moving it in a steady circular motion. As his sword moves, I can see the air starting to spin around it at great speed. Once he stops rotating his sword, he slashes powerfully towards Kate, generating a strong gust of wind that blows her off her ice platform.<br/><br/>She manages to quickly conjure an improvised slide of ice below her and immediately after she lands on the ground, she turns towards Daren with her palms pointing at him. A beam of ice shoots from her hands and heads straight for Daren, who is now holding his sword in front of him. The beam hits his sword head on, but instead of getting frozen, the weapon absorbs the energy from the attack and starts radiating a cold magical aura.<br/><br/> Daren then slashes his sword at Kate, which sends the ice beam right back at her. She manages to get out of its way in the nick of time and attempts to retaliate, but Daren, who had already reached her, slashes his sword at her left ankle, making her drop to one knee. She tries to attack him with a beam again, but all she manages to do is point her palms at him, while the ice refuses to come out of her hands. The block of ice she trapped me in is also starting to slowly melt away.<br/>\"No...\" she says in disbelief.<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid that won't work anymore, Kate,\" Daren says. \"You won't be able to cast any kind of magic for the next thirty minutes. I already told you, I specialize in dealing with elementalists. My shield protects me against most magical attacks, my weapon can absorb the elements, and I have a sword technique that can temporarily sever your link with the magical plane. You never stood a chance to begin with.\"<br/><br/>Kate tries to get up, but she realizes she can't hope to outrun Daren with her wounded leg.

She does not say a word to me while we distance ourselves from Daren, but she is holding my arm very tightly, even though she hasn't tripped once since we started walking. <br/><br/>Once we've put enough distance between ourselves and Daren, I help Kate lay down with her back against an oak tree, and she simply stares at the ground, still not saying anything.<br/><br/>",

They are indeed the oldest race on this continent, which is why most people refer to them as simply 'the ancients'. However, even though their civilization fell hundreds of years ago, there are still small groups of lessathi here and there, staying hidden and trying to influence events from the shadows. As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore.

As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods.\"<br/>\"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore. They are very secretive, and also very isolated from all other races. They have their own villages, hidden from the rest of the world, and they are only allowed to marry other lessathi.

        "text": " \"What is this, an earthquake?\" Daren says.<br/>\"Please don't be a dragon, please don't be a dragon, please don't be a dragon,\" Rose says, starting to panic.<br/><br/>As the earthquake intensifies, we start seeing a human figure in the distance, getting bigger and bigger, until it reaches a height of fifty feet. The giant man is dressed in leather armor, he has a black beard that reaches down to his chest, and he has a big grin on his face. As he starts to speak, his voice is so loud that it completely drowns out any other sounds in a five mile radius. It doesn't really help that he's shouting either.<br/><br/>\"Now that I have everyone's attention,\" the giant man says. \"I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Hadrik, but my friends call me 'the dwarf'. I came to this tournament for only one reason: to test my strength against the strongest mages in the world! So, what do you all say?! Shall we have a fun little practice bout before we get our objectives? I'll be waiting right here for any challengers! I'll try to hold back as much as I can, but I can't make any promises. Ahahahahahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>His laugh is loud and jolly, kind of like the laughter you hear from friendly bartenders and innkeepers. What's wrong with this guy? Doesn't he realize what kind of place this is?<br/><br/>The giant starts to shrink slowly as he's laughing, and eventually he disappears behind the trees.<br/><br/> \"Damn!\" Daren says. \"That is some impressive shapeshifting. He must have a lot of magical power to be able to turn into something this big!\"<br/>\"Do you have no knowledge of even the basics of shapeshifting magic?\" Kate asks him. \"You can't just turn into something ten times bigger than your normal size, no matter how powerful you are. It violates the fundamental principles of shapeshifting. This was obviously an illusion.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah? Since you're so sure it was an illusion, could you perhaps care to explain how he managed to make such a realistic earth tremor while he was busy maintaining the illusion spell?\"<br/><br/>\"How am I supposed to know that? Maybe he has an ally that specializes in earth magic. How is that even relevant?\"<br/><br/>Something isn't right here. Although the fundamental principles Kate speaks of should indeed prohibit the use of shapeshifting in such a manner, an illusion isn't that much more probable either. There's no way any illusion could reach this far out, no matter how powerful the mage is. There must be something we're missing. Or perhaps the man who calls himself Hadrik managed to find a way to temporarily circumvent the laws of magic as we know them?<br/><br/>",

They call them the four sages, and each of them represents one of the four major continents in the world. The sage title is earned or maintained through yearly contests that are held by the leading nations of each continent.

They call them the four sages, and each of them represents one of the four major continents in the world. The sage title is earned or maintained through yearly contests that are held by the leading nations of each continent. Given that each of the four major continents is named after the cardinal point that represents its position on the world map, each sage title also carries the appropriate cardinal point in its name.<br/>The Sage of the West looks exactly as I've seen him in the pictures. An old man, almost eighty years of age, with a long beard as white as snow, holding a long wooden staff in his right hand, and wearing traditional wizard robes, as well as a pointed hat. He is like a living example of what most people would imagine when thinking of a mage. <br/><br/>\"Barry! Hey, Barry!!! Are you listening to me?\"<br/><br/>I realize I must have spaced out while looking at the old sage, because I have no idea what Daren's been talking about for the past ten seconds.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said? I don't think I caught all of that.\"<br/><br/>\"I was saying that this is the perfect opportunity to make our way out of here. They won't pay any attention to us because they're too focused on watching the fight.\"<br/><br/>",

Didn't you all see him fight that dragon in the sky singlehandedly a few hours ago?\"<br/>There's a loud murmur again, as many of the mages confirm having seen me duel the dragon.

She is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman. <br/><br/>The two combatants are now circling each other. Eiden is smiling as usual, and the dwarf has a big grin on his face. Neither of them are holding any weapons. Are they planning to fight barehanded?<br/><br/> The fight starts suddenly, without any warning. Both of the fighters lunge at each other at the same time, and Hadrik initiates by jumping into the air, raising his right leg as high as he can and bringing it down like an axe, in an attempt to smash the stillwater's skull. Eiden steps casually to the side and the dwarf's boot hits the ground, which makes a small crater and sends rubble flying all over the place. The stillwater wastes no time and hits Hadrik in the chest with his right palm, his strike sending a powerful blast of air all around him and pushing the dwarf back ten feet.<br/>\"What the hell is this?\" shouts one of the mages. \"They barely even started fighting and they're already using strength enhancing magic?\"<br/><br/>\"They're not using any magic,\" says another mage. \"I've been closely monitoring their magical auras since they started, and there have been no fluctuations so far.\"<br/><br/>\"What, you're going to tell me they just did a lot of squats and pushups? You can't get this powerful just through training.\"<br/><br/> Yes, you can, in theory. There's a kind of magic that helps with surpassing the limitations of the human body while doing physical training. The downside is that unless you have a lifespan of hundreds of years, you'd have to spend most of your life training in order to reach their levels of strength. Could they be using stat devices too?<br/>The two contenders are now moving so fast that I can barely follow them anymore. Eiden is landing most of his hits, but the dwarf doesn't seem to be having any trouble tanking them. Hadrik, however, hasn't managed to hit the stillwater once. Whenever it looks like he's got a decent chance, Eiden flows like water and effortlessly gets out of his way, subsequently using the dwarf's momentum against him in order to make him lose balance.<br/><br/>",

At least the two combatants seem to be enjoying themselves well enough.<br/><br/>\"You're all pathetic!\" shouts a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. \"There are dozens of you and you're still scared to take on a single stillwater? Don't tell me you're actually planning to watch the fight until the end?\"<br/><br/>Eiden and Hadrik have now stopped their battle and are both looking at the mage who just spoke.<br/><br/>\"Calm down, my friend,\" Azarius says. \"He already told us that he's not participating in the tournament. Why should we attack him for no good reason?\"<br/><br/>\"You're a fool to believe him, old man. A fool and a coward. If you're all too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself.\"<br/><br/>He turns towards Eiden and raises his hands in the air.<br/><br/>\"Behold, stillwater. Behold, the power of Felran, the strongest fire elementalist on the Eastern Continent!\"<br/><br/>As he speaks, there's an enormous spinning column of fire forming around him. <br/><br/> \"I see you've already accepted your fate. You're not even trying to raise a magical barrier around yourself. Don't worry, I'll make this quick. I can't really guarantee you it will be painless, though. YAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\"<br/>His laugh is just as crazy as the look in his eyes. Eiden looks at him calmly, with his eyes closed, and he raises an eyebrow.<br/><br/>\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the stillwater in the form of a beam. Before the flames reach him, Eiden stretches his right arm in front of him, with his palm facing the elementalist mage. All of the fire stops and gets condensed into a small bright sphere, floating in front of his hand. The sphere then gets sent back towards its original owner, with shocking speed, incinerating the elementalist in an instant. The flames disappear just as fast as they appeared, leaving only a pile of ashes where the proud mage once stood. <br/><br/>\"Damn! You sure don't pull your punches,\" Hadrik tells the stillwater.<br/><br/>\"Neither did he, for all the good it did him,\" Eiden says. <br/><br/>He then looks towards me, with his eyes still closed and smiles wickedly. Oh no. He must have just realized he also teleported me here along with all the others. What is he plotting this time?<br/><br/>\"Alright, let's continue, then!\" says the dwarf, grinning.<br/><br/> \"I am terribly sorry, but something came up and I no longer have the time to finish our duel. However, there is another stillwater in this clearing who I'm sure would be more than glad to be your next opponent!\"<br/>As he looks at me, smiling, all of the mages turn their heads and notice me for the first time. <br/><br/>",

Kate is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman, while moving very cautiously, to avoid attracting any attention to herself.  As we make our way out of the crowd, most people are simply ignoring us, while they try to make their way to the center, in order to get a better view of the fight. At this rate, we'll be out of here in no time!<br/><br/>\"Hey, watch where you're going you little runt!\"<br/><br/>I look behind me, to see what the commotion is about. A very large man that is at least a head taller than Daren is now furiously looking towards Kate, who seems to have bumped into him by accident. She tries to move silently past him, but the man grabs her by the cloak and lifts her into the air.<br/><br/>\"Don't you dare ignore me, you son of a--\"<br/><br/>As the hood drops from Kate's head and her face is revealed, the large mage paralyzes with fear for a few seconds. He then immediately drops her, backs away three feet and starts screaming at the top of his lungs.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch7_tap || 0) == 1) {%> \"Aaaaaaah! Stay away from me, monster! Stay away!\"<br/>Everyone's attention has now been directed towards us. Even Eiden and Hadrik have stopped their fight to look in our direction.<br/><br/>\"Not this again,\" says Daren, exasperated.<br/><br/>\"What are you screaming so loud about, you imbecile?\" asks a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. \"It's just a banshee. There are dozens of us here. She doesn't stand a chance.\"<br/><br/>\"It's not just a banshee,\" says another mage. \"She has allies. I saw her speak to those two over there a few seconds ago.\"<br/><br/>\"What kind of a banshee allies herself with mages, you fools?\" Kate shouts at them, with a very determined look on her face. \"Don't insult me. I've come here alone. And I'm going to end you all by myself as well.\"<br/><br/>For a moment, her words confused me, but then I realized she must be trying to protect us. When I try to step towards Kate, Daren stops me.<br/><br/>\"Hey, now, let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he whispers to me. \"Why should we risk our lives just because she refuses to get purified? We can't go on like this forever.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

I should be mad, but somehow this scenario seems a lot more fitting for our final moments together.\"<br/><br/>\"How pathetic,\" says the mage in red robes. \"You should have just stayed back and let the banshee fight us. Do you seriously think you can make a difference?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Do you think a stillwater could make a difference in this fight?\"<br/><br/>\"No. Not even a stillwater could turn the tide against so many people. But you're not even that, are you? You're just some ordinary guy who's trying to bite off more than he can chew.\"<br/><br/> \"I guess intimidation tactics don't really work on you, do they?\" I ask him as I take out my dagger. \"Fine, let's do this. Give it your best shot!\"<br/>While the two of us were talking, the other mages were busy moving to surround us.

Hadrik does not say anything, but I can see him clenching his right fist really hard, and I can feel the magical aura around it harden considerably.<br/><br/>\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the dwarf in the form of a beam. Hadrik waits for the fire to reach him, and just before it hits him, he punches it with all of his might. Instead of dispersing, however, all of the fire gets sent back to its owner, at double the speed. Before he can even understand what's going on, Felran gets completely incinerated, leaving behind only a pile of ashes, that are now scattering in the wind.<br/><br/> \"That filthy son of a walrus!\" Hadrik says. \"He was seriously trying to kill me!\"<br/>Seeing the threat that the dwarf poses, all of the other mages that were preparing to attack Kate are now trying to coordinate themselves in order to attack him at the same time. <br/><br/>\"Enough!\" shouts Azarius, the sage. \"There will be no more bloodshed this day. If any of you toddlers still feel like raising a ruckus, I am the one that you'll be fighting next.

When I stop right in front of the healer, looking at him with a smile on my face, I can see his sweat dropping from his forehead. Just as I thought. With the exception of Daren, healers are all bark and no bite.<br/>\"What's wrong?\" I ask him. \"Didn't you say that this was the best time to strike? Well, I'm right here. Give it your best shot!\"<br/><br/>The blond mage attempts to grab his dagger, but his hand is trembling too much to be able to unsheathe it. I can see the fear in his eyes as he desperately looks around him for some support from his allies, but they're all too scared to say anything.<br/><br/>\"Y-Y-You're in luck, stillwater!\" he says, finally. \"I've changed my mind. I would much rather fight you on equal terms, after you've fully recovered. I never really liked unfair fights. We'll see you again, soon. Come on, men, we're leaving.\"<br/><br/>The white mage heads for the forest, and about ten or so mages are slowly starting to follow in his footsteps. After the whole scene has ended, I can see Eiden smirk from afar, while he takes his leave as well, by teleporting out of the clearing.<br/><br/> Just as I was beginning to think that the danger was gone, I suddenly find myself surrounded by ten rock golems, each of them being at least twice my size.  So there was also a powerful summoner amongst these mages. I was careless to let my guard down just because I scared off a few weaklings.<br/>\"What's the matter, stillwater?\" I hear a voice coming from behind the wall of golems. \"Why don't you try and walk up to my golems like you did with that cowardly healer? Maybe you'll scare them off!\"<br/><br/>\"Barry!\" screams Daren as he slashes through one of the golems and joins my side.<br/><br/>There's still nine golems to go, and they have us surrounded.

I'll take the nine on the left. You can take the three on the right.\"<br/><br/>\"You really are looking down on me, aren't you?\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, I'm not the one trying to act all badass with a glorified slingshot in his hands.\"<br/><br/>He doesn't give me the time to reply, and rushes into the midst of the enemy forces, swinging his sword left and right. I guess I should be getting to work as well. The three on the right, huh? <br/><br/>I shoot the first one in the head while he's being distracted by Daren's bull rush. The second one barely had the time to understand what was going on before I also shot him down. The third one sees what happened to his comrades and attempts to rush at me with his dagger, but it was a futile attempt. Once I kill the last of the henchmen on the right side, I look towards the healer and notice that he is no longer protected by any of his bodyguards. What's more, he isn't even looking towards me, being more concerned with what's happening on Daren's side of the battlefield. It was the easiest thing in the world to take him out as well, with a well placed shot to the temple.<br/><br/> When they see their leader fall to the ground, the mages in his team who were still left alive completely freak out and start running away as far as their legs can carry them, without so much as a single glance back towards us.<br/>\"I guess that's that,\" Daren says, and he starts walking back towards me.<br/><br/>As he approaches my location, we suddenly find ourselves surrounded by about ten rock golems that spawned out of nowhere and are at least twice the size of me.<br/><br/>So there was also a powerful summoner amongst these mages. I was careless to let my guard down just because I scared off a few weaklings.<br/><br/>\"What's the matter, stillwater?\" I hear a voice coming from behind the wall of golems. \"Aren't you going to shoot the golems with your little crossbow as well?\"<br/><br/>This isn't good. Daren won't be able to fight all these golems by himself while also defending me. I need to do something.<br/><br/>",

If you are simply in search of fresh corpses, I assure you that there are plenty to be found lying around these parts after yesterday's events.\"<br/><br/>\"Do not question the great Ulruk's judgment, heathen. Your actions have angered my god, and now you will feel his wrath!\"<br/><br/>A mage who is wearing a silver circlet on his head and green robes grabs the necromancer by the arm.<br/><br/>\"Calm down, Zack,\" he says. \"There's plenty of time left till the end of the day. We can just kill some more people after we get out of here and the number of deaths will be the same.\"<br/><br/>\"Unhand me, fool! I'm only travelling with you because my god ordered me to. Do not presume to tell me what to do! This matter has nothing to do with you or your God of Fate.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Supposedly, it was a great war that was waged on this continent between stillwaters and ancients some six hundred years ago.\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" Zack says. \"But what would you do if I told you that the remains of the stillwaters who died in that war can still be found deep underground, scattered throughout the continent.\"<br/><br/>As the necromancer speaks, dozens of skeletons are starting to slowly surface from the ground below us. <br/><br/>\"What would you do if I told you that I could bring these stillwaters back to life as my puppets, with almost all of their former magical prowess still intact?\"<br/><br/> The skeletons are now starting to attack all of the mages around us while they're running away, screaming in terror. The sky itself has darkened as it started literally raining fire and brimstone. Kate is struggling to keep an icy roof above our heads to shield us from the flames, but it's melting almost as quick as she's reinforcing it.<br/>\"What would you do, sage? Tell me!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, since you asked me so politely,\" Azarius says, smiling. \"What I would do is this.\"<br/><br/>The Sage of the West smashes his staff into the ground, and I can feel a very intense vibration in the air all around us. The skeletons have suddenly stopped rampaging and are all just standing in place, vibrating loudly. After a few seconds, all of their bones shatter into pieces at the same time, as the rain of fire is brought to a halt, and the sky is starting to clear up once more.<br/><br/>Zack, the necromancer appears to be dumbstruck, as he desperately looks around himself to see if there isn't at least one of his undead minions that escaped the onslaught.<br/><br/>",

I'm tired of always having to save your sorry behind.

Weren't you the one who taught me that banshees are foul demons that are not to be trusted?\"<br/>\"Henry, I've told you many times before, there is no need to be so formal when you address me. You can call me simply Azarius. As for your question, before I answer you, I must ask you this: Do you remember the first lesson I taught you about banshees? Do you remember why banshees need to possess human or animal bodies in order to survive?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course! The banshees were originally born on the magical plane of existence, but they were banished long ago and cursed to live the rest of their lives on our earthen plane. On this plane, it is not possible to live for long without a physical body, so the banshees were forced to adapt, by stealing the bodies of other living organisms. Once it is seized by a banshee, the body stops aging, but due to the incompatibility between the banshee's soul and the physical body, the link between the two will decay over time, which forces the spirit to change hosts once every few decades.\"<br/><br/>\"Very good!\" Azarius says. \"Now, tell me, do you sense any kind of other-worldly vibe radiating from this woman's body? Does her magical aura appear in any way to be different from that of any other mage you've encountered in your life?\"<br/><br/>\"No, but, I do not understand... How can this be?...\"<br/><br/> The sage smiles.<br/>\"That is because she isn't a banshee. She is a woman with magical powers. A woman mage, if you will.\"<br/><br/>\"What?!\" Daren blurts out. \"How can you be so sure? You can't possibly tell me that you are basing your entire reasoning on something so vague!\"<br/><br/>\"You surprise me, healer in armor,\" Azarius says, thoughtfully, as he strokes his beard. \"The way you phrased your last sentence suggests that you do not believe this woman to be anything other than a banshee. And yet you seem to travel alongside her. Most peculiar.\"<br/><br/>Daren is looking a little flustered after hearing the sage's remark, but Azarius pays him no mind and instead steps towards me.<br/><br/>\"What about you, Barry?\" he asks me. \"From what I could gather, the four of you are all travelling together.

What is this Beacon of Hope, anyway?\"<br/><br/>\"To put it bluntly,\" Azarius says, \"the Beacon of Hope was a human experimentation facility disguised as an orphanage. The purpose of that institution was to create mages artificially. Kate's magical powers are a direct result of those experiments.\"<br/><br/> \"She's... what?...\" Daren asks, seemingly in too much of a shock to be able to form a coherent sentence.<br/>\"Kate, you were a mage?\" Rose asks, surprised.<br/><br/>\"Yes...\" Kate answers her. \"What did you think I was?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, those mages we met in the forest this morning kept shouting that you were a banshee, so I kind of figured that's what you were... Everyone seemed to know what it meant, so I didn't want to appear dumb by asking.\"<br/><br/>Kate laughs softly.<br/><br/>\"I guess labels aren't really very important to you, are they, Rose?\" she says, smiling.<br/><br/>\"Still, I have to admit,\" Hadrik says, grinning, \"I didn't expect to meet two survivors from the Beacon in the same day. This tournament is really something else!\"<br/><br/>\"Two survivors?\" I ask him. \"You mean to say that there is another artificial mage here on this continent besides Kate?\"<br/><br/>\"Aye!\" the dwarf says. \"And she's mighty strong too! She took me out with almost no effort. I'm pretty sure that she was using lightning in the same way elementalists would use water or fire. Being an artificial mage sure has its perks!\"<br/><br/>",

I only barely escaped with my life the last time.

You can't be serious!

You rarely get to meet a worthier opponent!\"<br/><br/>Kate looks at me hesitatingly, probably wanting to see what my reaction is to all of this.<br/><br/>\"I'm not looking for an all out fight,\" Hadrik says. \"We wouldn't want to wear ourselves out completely before the tournament even begins. A short sparring session will do! No magic, no weapons, just like my fight with the stillwater from before. And since we're in a hurry, whoever makes the other one fall to the ground first will be declared the victor!\"<br/><br/>The dwarf turns to me, grinning yet again.<br/><br/>\"So, what do you say, Barry?

Kate's dragon follows him, and in the meantime, she starts building a cage of ice around herself, which she then uses to raise herself into the air, in order to get a better view of the fight.<br/>The two dragons are diving at each other and attacking with both their claws and their fangs. Kate's reinforced ice seems to be holding up rather well against Hadrik's attacks. I'm quite sure that Tyrath would have sliced through her ice dragon as through butter. I guess his 'king of all dragons' title was not just for show after all.<br/><br/>Kate is now ramping up her attacks by also shooting Hadrik with hundreds of icicles while her ice dragon is still on his tail. Every time that Hadrik tries to go for Kate, she moves her cage out of his way, and sends her ice dragon to intercept him. Some of the icicles hit the black dragon in his left wing, and he starts falling from the sky, as the ice dragon takes full advantage of this opportunity and dives right onto its opponent.<br/><br/>The two dragons crash on the ground, with the ice one on top, pinning the black one into place with its claws. Kate is now slowly descending as well, still in her ice cage, and she looks at Hadrik, waiting for his next move.<br/><br/>\"Okay, okay, I give up, you win!\" Hadrik says, as he transforms back into his dwarf form.<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, Kate brings her cage back down, and once she's safely on the ground, she dismisses both the cage and the dragon.<br/><br/> \"Does this mean that you'll grant me my request?\" Kate says, with a hopeful look in her eyes.<br/>\"Well, I can't say that I'm really looking forward to it, but a deal's a deal. Pack your bags, Kate, I'm going to lead you to your friend!\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you so much...\" Kate says. \"I have a lot of money with me, I promise I will make it worth your while.\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Hadrik asks her. \"I already said that we have a deal, didn't I?

He also seems to be able to completely ignore the traditional laws of magic. When we first met him, he just bypassed all of Daren's magical protections and put him to sleep with a simple wave of his hand. Oh, and one more thing. He appears to be virtually undetectable when he turns invisible. I couldn't even sense a hint of his magical aura when he was hiding his presence.\"<br/>\"Interesting...\" Azarius says, as he smashes his staff into the ground and I feel a wave of air hit me in the face. \"Well, unless he also found a way to completely eliminate his physical presence from this plane, we can rest assured that he at least isn't listening to our conversation right now. I just used a sonar spell to detect all objects and persons in the area, and we are the only mages in this clearing. I also have another question for you. Do you know if he has any enemies here on this continent?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, he does! Tyrath, the dragon I've fought in the sky a few hours ago was looking specifically for Eiden and wanted him dead. I believe that he's made an enemy of the lessathi as well. He told us to deliver a message to any ancients we find, and tell them to 'remember the still winter'. Given what I've heard you say about the still winter earlier, I can only assume that it's meant as a threat.\"<br/><br/> \"I see,\" the old sage says as he strokes his beard. \"This could prove to be invaluable information, if we are ever to make an enemy of him ourselves. The stillwater said earlier that he wasn't participating in the tournament, but it never hurts to be too careful. Thank you for sharing this with me.\"<br/>\"You're welcome,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"Master Azarius!\" the mage's pupil says, as he approaches us, holding a map in his hands.<br/><br/>\"Azarius,\" the sage says. \"Just call me Azarius.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, master Azarius.\"<br/><br/>The sage sighs.<br/><br/>\"Tell me, Henry, what is it?\"<br/><br/>\"I noticed that there is an unusually large concentration of magic around this area,\" Henry says, while pointing at the lower side of his map. \"Perhaps it could be what we are looking for?\"<br/><br/>\"Perhaps...\" Azarius says. \"At any rate,  it's not very far from here, so I suppose we could make it there before it gets too dark to see anything. Mark the location on the map.\"<br/><br/>\"Understood.\"<br/><br/>As Kate comes back with her backpack, Azarius turns to us.<br/><br/> \"Goodbye, my friends,\" he says. \"I wish you all safe travels, and I hope we'll meet again.\"<br/>\"Goodbye, Azarius! Goodbye, Henry!\" Rose says, as we all wave to them. \"I'm sure that our paths will cross again someday!\"<br/><br/>Henry looks back towards us with a surprised expression on his face. He probably isn't used to people acknowledging his existence as he travels alongside the Sage of the West. He nods curtly to Rose, and then hurries to catch up with Azarius, as they both slowly distance themselves from us and disappear into the depths of the forest.<br/><br/>",

Of course we are. Naturally!\"<br/><br/>\"What?...\" Kate says, shocked. \"No, Rose, you can't! What about all of the sick people waiting for you in your hometown?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that!\" Rose says. \"With all of the shortcuts we've been taking so far, I am days ahead of my original schedule. I would've never had the courage to take such a direct route if you hadn't been there to escort me. Accompanying you on your way to meet your friend is the least I can do to pay you back.

I couldn't...\" Kate starts to say, but Hadrik interrupts her.<br/><br/>\"It's settled then!\" he says loudly, completely drowning out the sound of Kate's voice. \"We all go to see Kate's friend! Now come on, follow me, I'm going to try and take a shortcut.\"<br/><br/>With these final words, we all grab our backpacks, and hurry up to follow Hadrik. Kate just stands there for a few moments, unsure of what to do, but then she decides to follow him too, and before long, she starts walking side by side with us again, as if our previous discussion never even took place.<br/><br/>We walk in complete silence for a few minutes. Kate has always been the silent type, so I'm not really surprised about her, but I don't think I've ever seen Daren go for more than a minute without opening his mouth. He must still be in shock after what he's heard about the Beacon. He's probably still having a hard time internalizing that information, given how adamantly he's been holding on to the opinion that Kate was a banshee until now.<br/><br/>\"Boy, you guys sure are a quiet bunch!\" Hadrik says, after a few more minutes of awkward silence. \"Fine, I'll break the ice, then.

Although, part of that may be due to the harsh weather conditions. Most, if not all of the dwarves live in the Northern Continent, and nothing warms you better in the middle of the cold freezing night than a bottle of strong ale!\"<br/><br/>\"Could you tell me how you and Diane met?\" Kate asks Hadrik.<br/><br/>\"Diane?...\" the dwarf says, confused. \"Oh, right, that's what your friend was called!\"<br/><br/>\"We met by chance this afternoon, while I was searching for a powerful opponent to fight. I mistook her for a banshee, and was excited at the prospect of having a one on one battle with such a strong challenger. Unfortunately for me, she proved to be a bit too powerful, and she neutralized me with a single spell. Her friends in the blue robes ordered her to finish me off, but she refused to do it. They eventually stopped trying to reason with her and told her to just make sure I don't stand in their way anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"She... defied the ancients?\" Kate asks, surprised.<br/><br/> \"Aye!\" Hadrik says. \"When I realized that she was actually serious about sparing my life, I asked her if she was really a banshee, and that's when she told me all about the Beacon of Hope, and about artificial mages.\"<br/>\"Could you tell us why you like fighting so much?\" Rose asks him.<br/><br/>\"Why does a bird flap its wings?\" Hadrik says. \"Why does a snake slither on the ground? I enjoy fighting because it's in my blood! My father was a warrior, and his father before him, and it goes the same for all the members of my clan.\" <br/><br/>\"Mahad selak...\" I tell Hadrik.<br/><br/>\"Mahad maktar!\" he answers me, without thinking.<br/><br/>Hadrik then realizes the trap I've laid for him and starts laughing loudly.<br/><br/>\"You got me, Barry!\" he says. \"Well played.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, I do not understand...\" Rose says.<br/><br/>\"Glory in life, glory in death,\" I translate to her. \"Many of the giants on the Northern Continent live and die by this credo, and some of the clans even use this as a salute between members. I read about it once in a book that described the races and culture of the Northern Continent.\"<br/><br/>\"But why would a dwarf like Hadrik know this credo?\" Rose asks, still confused.<br/><br/>\"It's because he isn't actually a dwarf. He's a giant shapeshifting as one.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"What?!\" Daren asks, utterly shocked.<br/>\"That's some really impressive deductive skills there, Barry,\" Hadrik tells me. \"How did you figure it out?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, ever since I saw you in the clearing, I could tell by your magical aura that you were already shapeshifting. But shapeshifting magic can only be used to modify your size or to transform yourself into another creature. You cannot use it to disguise yourself as someone else. So I figured that you needed to have some sort of reason to make yourself seem smaller than you actually were. It was then that I remembered your giant form from when you first called out to us. Normally it should be impossible for someone to transform himself into a giant, because it would break the laws of shapeshifting. That made me realize that it must have been the other way around, and that the giant form was actually your original form.\"<br/><br/>Hadrik laughs again.<br/><br/>\"Well, you found out my secret,\" he says. \"What are you going to do now? Will you report me to the organizers so that they can kick me out of the tournament? Are you going to use this information to blackmail me into helping you with the objectives?\"  <br/><br/> \"What?\" I ask him. \"No, don't be ridiculous. If I did any of that, then what were to stop you from also reporting me for having joined this mage tournament as an ordinary human? The reality is that the organizers likely just don't care. They didn't even bother to do some minimal screening of the contestants, and let hundreds of ordinary people like me join this tournament without even considering the implications. Why would they care if they also let in a giant or two?\"<br/>\"I think you may be right,\" Hadrik says. \"Well, I guess that's enough questions for now. If we go on like this, I may well end up giving away my home address. Hahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>As we advance through the forest, we start seeing some bright yellow lights circling around the trees.  <br/><br/>\"What are these, I wonder?\" I ask, as I point towards one of the yellow lights. \"Overgrown fireflies?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Rose says. \"Oh, no... This isn't good. We need to get out of this place as fast as possible.\"<br/><br/>\"Why?\" I ask her. \"What's wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"These aren't fireflies, they're spirits of the forest. We must have entered their sacred woods by accident. We're not allowed to be here!\"<br/><br/>",
