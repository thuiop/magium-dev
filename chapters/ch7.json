When my sister started gaining magical powers, we were all overjoyed, because we thought we had a mage in the family. Then one night...\"<br/>I start getting flashbacks of the night when my sister turned into a banshee. It feels as if her sinister laughter is still ringing in my ears.<br/><br/>\"One night, I came home to find the bodies of my parents lying in pools of blood, with my sister standing above them. Only it wasn't my sister anymore. Everything was different about her, even her magical aura. She was just about to kill my younger brother, when I picked a pitchfork from the ground, and impaled her with it. I was lucky. The banshee had just awakened, which made her vulnerable. If I had arrived even a few minutes later, I don't think anyone would have been able to stop her anymore.\"<br/><br/>I pause, and then look Kate straight in the eye.<br/><br/> \"Daren's transceiver is made so that I can let him know when I'm in danger by simply tapping it three times. I could have done that the moment you put your dagger to my throat, but I didn't, for the same reason I didn't refuse to go alone with you in these woods, despite the obvious risks. It's because I wanted to talk things through with you, and make sure that we clear things up between us. Now, tell me, Kate, do you still think I'm saying all of this just so I can gain your trust in order to capture or assassinate you?\"<br/>Kate's hand holding the dagger is starting to tremble, and the fierce determination she had in her eyes is slowly dying down. She lowers her dagger, and her gaze turns towards the ground on her left side.<br/><br/>\"No, I don't,\" she answers me. \"I'm... really sorry. For everything...\"<br/><br/>",

His defensive barrier seems to be holding up a lot better than it usually does against normal weapons. None of Kate's ice swords are getting through it, even though she's attacking him from all directions.<br/><br/>Daren is now raising his sword into the air,  and moving it in a steady circular motion. As his sword moves, I can see the air starting to spin around it at great speed. Once he stops rotating his sword, he slashes powerfully towards Kate, generating a strong gust of wind that blows her off her ice platform.<br/><br/>She manages to quickly conjure an improvised slide of ice below her and immediately after she lands on the ground, she turns towards Daren with her palms pointing at him. A beam of ice shoots from her hands and heads straight for Daren, who is now holding his sword in front of him. The beam hits his sword head on, but instead of getting frozen, the weapon absorbs the energy from the attack and starts radiating a cold magical aura.<br/><br/> Daren then slashes his sword at Kate, which sends the ice beam right back at her. She manages to get out of its way in the nick of time and attempts to retaliate, but Daren, who had already reached her, slashes his sword at her left ankle, making her drop to one knee. She tries to attack him with a beam again, but all she manages to do is point her palms at him, while the ice refuses to come out of her hands. The block of ice she trapped me in is also starting to slowly melt away.<br/>\"No...\" she says in disbelief.<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid that won't work anymore, Kate,\" Daren says. \"You won't be able to cast any kind of magic for the next thirty minutes. I already told you, I specialize in dealing with elementalists. My shield protects me against most magical attacks, my weapon can absorb the elements, and I have a sword technique that can temporarily sever your link with the magical plane. You never stood a chance to begin with.\"<br/><br/>Kate tries to get up, but she realizes she can't hope to outrun Daren with her wounded leg.

I rush over to her in order to grab her before falling, and then we both start to head deeper into the forest. As we walk, Kate is holding my left arm with both her hands, in order to keep herself from falling again. She does not say a word to me while we distance ourselves from Daren, but she is holding my arm very tightly, even though she hasn't tripped once since we started walking. <br/><br/>Once we've put enough distance between ourselves and Daren, I help Kate lay down with her back against an oak tree, and she simply stares at the ground, still not saying anything.<br/><br/>",

They are indeed the oldest race on this continent, which is why most people refer to them as simply 'the ancients'. However, even though their civilization fell hundreds of years ago, there are still small groups of lessathi here and there, staying hidden and trying to influence events from the shadows. As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore.

As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods.\"<br/>\"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore. They are very secretive, and also very isolated from all other races. They have their own villages, hidden from the rest of the world, and they are only allowed to marry other lessathi.

Since you're so sure it was an illusion, could you perhaps care to explain how he managed to make such a realistic earth tremor while he was busy maintaining the illusion spell?\"<br/><br/>\"How am I supposed to know that? Maybe he has an ally that specializes in earth magic. How is that even relevant?\"<br/><br/>Something isn't right here. Although the fundamental principles Kate speaks of should indeed prohibit the use of shapeshifting in such a manner, an illusion isn't that much more probable either. There's no way any illusion could reach this far out, no matter how powerful the mage is. There must be something we're missing. Or perhaps the man who calls himself Hadrik managed to find a way to temporarily circumvent the laws of magic as we know them?<br/><br/>",

Remember how Eiden easily dodged all of your attacks the first time we met him? Since he isn't going to use any magic, this should give us some very valuable information regarding his martial arts training.\"<br/><br/>\"Valuable enough to risk our lives for it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, actually. You do realize we'll likely have to fight him by the end of this tournament, don't you? Shouldn't we take advantage of every chance we get to try and find his weaknesses, even at the risk of our own safety?\"<br/><br/>Daren grumbles, the way he always does when he can't find a good enough counter-argument to throw in my face. Eventually, he calms down and steps forward, to get a better look at the battle that is about to begin. <br/><br/>Kate, who has heard our discussion, is also stepping forward in order to see the fight better. She is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman. <br/><br/>The two combatants are now circling each other. Eiden is smiling as usual, and the dwarf has a big grin on his face. Neither of them are holding any weapons. Are they planning to fight barehanded?<br/><br/> The fight starts suddenly, without any warning. Both of the fighters lunge at each other at the same time, and Hadrik initiates by jumping into the air, raising his right leg as high as he can and bringing it down like an axe, in an attempt to smash the stillwater's skull. Eiden steps casually to the side and the dwarf's boot hits the ground, which makes a small crater and sends rubble flying all over the place. The stillwater wastes no time and hits Hadrik in the chest with his right palm, his strike sending a powerful blast of air all around him and pushing the dwarf back ten feet.<br/>\"What the hell is this?\" shouts one of the mages. \"They barely even started fighting and they're already using strength enhancing magic?\"<br/><br/>\"They're not using any magic,\" says another mage. \"I've been closely monitoring their magical auras since they started, and there have been no fluctuations so far.\"<br/><br/>\"What, you're going to tell me they just did a lot of squats and pushups? You can't get this powerful just through training.\"<br/><br/> Yes, you can, in theory. There's a kind of magic that helps with surpassing the limitations of the human body while doing physical training. The downside is that unless you have a lifespan of hundreds of years, you'd have to spend most of your life training in order to reach their levels of strength. Could they be using stat devices too?<br/>The two contenders are now moving so fast that I can barely follow them anymore. Eiden is landing most of his hits, but the dwarf doesn't seem to be having any trouble tanking them. Hadrik, however, hasn't managed to hit the stillwater once. Whenever it looks like he's got a decent chance, Eiden flows like water and effortlessly gets out of his way, subsequently using the dwarf's momentum against him in order to make him lose balance.<br/><br/>",

Hell, I'm not even sure if he's being serious right now.\"<br/>A few more minutes pass, and the fight still doesn't seem to be going anywhere. At least the two combatants seem to be enjoying themselves well enough.<br/><br/>\"You're all pathetic!\" shouts a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. \"There are dozens of you and you're still scared to take on a single stillwater? Don't tell me you're actually planning to watch the fight until the end?\"<br/><br/>Eiden and Hadrik have now stopped their battle and are both looking at the mage who just spoke.<br/><br/>\"Calm down, my friend,\" Azarius says. \"He already told us that he's not participating in the tournament. Why should we attack him for no good reason?\"<br/><br/>\"You're a fool to believe him, old man. A fool and a coward. If you're all too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself.\"<br/><br/>He turns towards Eiden and raises his hands in the air.<br/><br/>\"Behold, stillwater. Behold, the power of Felran, the strongest fire elementalist on the Eastern Continent!\"<br/><br/>As he speaks, there's an enormous spinning column of fire forming around him. <br/><br/> \"I see you've already accepted your fate. You're not even trying to raise a magical barrier around yourself. Don't worry, I'll make this quick. I can't really guarantee you it will be painless, though. YAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\"<br/>His laugh is just as crazy as the look in his eyes. Eiden looks at him calmly, with his eyes closed, and he raises an eyebrow.<br/><br/>\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the stillwater in the form of a beam. Before the flames reach him, Eiden stretches his right arm in front of him, with his palm facing the elementalist mage. All of the fire stops and gets condensed into a small bright sphere, floating in front of his hand. The sphere then gets sent back towards its original owner, with shocking speed, incinerating the elementalist in an instant. The flames disappear just as fast as they appeared, leaving only a pile of ashes where the proud mage once stood. <br/><br/>\"Damn! You sure don't pull your punches,\" Hadrik tells the stillwater.<br/><br/>\"Neither did he, for all the good it did him,\" Eiden says. <br/><br/>He then looks towards me, with his eyes still closed and smiles wickedly. Oh no. He must have just realized he also teleported me here along with all the others. What is he plotting this time?<br/><br/>\"Alright, let's continue, then!\" says the dwarf, grinning.<br/><br/> \"I am terribly sorry, but something came up and I no longer have the time to finish our duel. However, there is another stillwater in this clearing who I'm sure would be more than glad to be your next opponent!\"<br/>As he looks at me, smiling, all of the mages turn their heads and notice me for the first time. <br/><br/>",

Hadrik does not say anything, but I can see him clenching his right fist really hard, and I can feel the magical aura around it harden considerably.<br/><br/>\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the dwarf in the form of a beam. Hadrik waits for the fire to reach him, and just before it hits him, he punches it with all of his might. Instead of dispersing, however, all of the fire gets sent back to its owner, at double the speed. Before he can even understand what's going on, Felran gets completely incinerated, leaving behind only a pile of ashes, that are now scattering in the wind.<br/><br/> \"That filthy son of a walrus!\" Hadrik says. \"He was seriously trying to kill me!\"<br/>Seeing the threat that the dwarf poses, all of the other mages that were preparing to attack Kate are now trying to coordinate themselves in order to attack him at the same time. <br/><br/>\"Enough!\" shouts Azarius, the sage. \"There will be no more bloodshed this day. If any of you toddlers still feel like raising a ruckus, I am the one that you'll be fighting next. Do I make myself clear?\"<br/><br/>Some of the mages looked like they were actually considering the old mage's proposition for a few seconds, but in the end they all decided against it, and started sheathing their weapons. The sage starts heading towards us, and as he walks, all of the other mages rush out of his way to give him clear passage.<br/><br/>\"Greetings, friends!\" he says, smiling, while he looks at the four of us, in turn. \"I apologize for not stopping this ridiculous fight sooner. I'm afraid that curiosity got the better of me, and I was hoping that letting things run their course would provide me with the rare opportunity of seeing the great hero Daren in action.

As I approach him, the mages that appeared to be part of his group are starting to panic, and they're stepping aside in order to clear my path. When I stop right in front of the healer, looking at him with a smile on my face, I can see his sweat dropping from his forehead. Just as I thought. With the exception of Daren, healers are all bark and no bite.<br/>\"What's wrong?\" I ask him. \"Didn't you say that this was the best time to strike? Well, I'm right here. Give it your best shot!\"<br/><br/>The blond mage attempts to grab his dagger, but his hand is trembling too much to be able to unsheathe it. I can see the fear in his eyes as he desperately looks around him for some support from his allies, but they're all too scared to say anything.<br/><br/>\"Y-Y-You're in luck, stillwater!\" he says, finally. \"I've changed my mind. I would much rather fight you on equal terms, after you've fully recovered. I never really liked unfair fights. We'll see you again, soon. Come on, men, we're leaving.\"<br/><br/>The white mage heads for the forest, and about ten or so mages are slowly starting to follow in his footsteps. After the whole scene has ended, I can see Eiden smirk from afar, while he takes his leave as well, by teleporting out of the clearing.<br/><br/> Just as I was beginning to think that the danger was gone, I suddenly find myself surrounded by ten rock golems, each of them being at least twice my size.  So there was also a powerful summoner amongst these mages. I was careless to let my guard down just because I scared off a few weaklings.<br/>\"What's the matter, stillwater?\" I hear a voice coming from behind the wall of golems. \"Why don't you try and walk up to my golems like you did with that cowardly healer? Maybe you'll scare them off!\"<br/><br/>\"Barry!\" screams Daren as he slashes through one of the golems and joins my side.<br/><br/>There's still nine golems to go, and they have us surrounded. Daren won't be able to destroy them all by himself while also defending me. I need to do something.<br/><br/>",

The skeletons have suddenly stopped rampaging and are all just standing in place, vibrating loudly. After a few seconds, all of their bones shatter into pieces at the same time, as the rain of fire is brought to a halt, and the sky is starting to clear up once more.<br/><br/>Zack, the necromancer appears to be dumbstruck, as he desperately looks around himself to see if there isn't at least one of his undead minions that escaped the onslaught.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Master Azarius,\" says the young boy standing beside him. \"I do not mean to be rude, but may I ask why you chose to intervene in this fight? Weren't you the one who taught me that banshees are foul demons that are not to be trusted?\"<br/>\"Henry, I've told you many times before, there is no need to be so formal when you address me. You can call me simply Azarius. As for your question, before I answer you, I must ask you this: Do you remember the first lesson I taught you about banshees? Do you remember why banshees need to possess human or animal bodies in order to survive?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course! The banshees were originally born on the magical plane of existence, but they were banished long ago and cursed to live the rest of their lives on our earthen plane. On this plane, it is not possible to live for long without a physical body, so the banshees were forced to adapt, by stealing the bodies of other living organisms. Once it is seized by a banshee, the body stops aging, but due to the incompatibility between the banshee's soul and the physical body, the link between the two will decay over time, which forces the spirit to change hosts once every few decades.\"<br/><br/>\"Very good!\" Azarius says. \"Now, tell me, do you sense any kind of other-worldly vibe radiating from this woman's body? Does her magical aura appear in any way to be different from that of any other mage you've encountered in your life?\"<br/><br/>\"No, but, I do not understand... How can this be?...\"<br/><br/> The sage smiles.<br/>\"That is because she isn't a banshee. She is a woman with magical powers. A woman mage, if you will.\"<br/><br/>\"What?!\" Daren blurts out. \"How can you be so sure? You can't possibly tell me that you are basing your entire reasoning on something so vague!\"<br/><br/>\"You surprise me, healer in armor,\" Azarius says, thoughtfully, as he strokes his beard. \"The way you phrased your last sentence suggests that you do not believe this woman to be anything other than a banshee. And yet you seem to travel alongside her. Most peculiar.\"<br/><br/>Daren is looking a little flustered after hearing the sage's remark, but Azarius pays him no mind and instead steps towards me.<br/><br/>\"What about you, Barry?\" he asks me. \"From what I could gather, the four of you are all travelling together. How would you define your relationship with the young woman named Kate?\"<br/><br/>",

The ground began to shake violently as he grew more and more, while his skin started getting covered in black scales and wings started sprouting out of his back.

His voice is much deeper and louder than when he's in his dwarf form. \"You aren't going to back out on me now, are you?\"<br/><br/>Kate frowns.<br/><br/>\"No,\" Kate says. \"I was just a little surprised, that's all. But if it's a dragon fight you want, then I have no objections.\"<br/><br/>Kate is now assembling her very own dragon out of sculpted ice, with a size to match that of Hadrik's. But this seems different from all of her other spells. The ice dragon that is now standing before us seems almost as if it were an actual living, breathing creature. This is on a whole other level compared to what she's cast before. She must really be going all out.<br/><br/>\"You may have the appearance of a dragon,\" Kate says. \"But you and I both know that shapeshifting does not grant you the ability to breathe fire, and you can't cast any fire spells while you are in that form either.

When he reached the end of his transformation, Hadrik had turned into a full blown black dragon, almost the same size as Tyrath.<br/><br/> \"There,\" Hadrik says, baring his fangs to show his usual wide grin. \"Now I'm ready!\"<br/>\"Gods have mercy...\" Kate says, looking up at the huge monster that had spawned before her.<br/><br/>\"Aaaaaaaah!\" Rose starts screaming all of a sudden as she sees the dragon. \"Stay away! Stay away!\"<br/><br/>\"Rose, calm down,\" Daren tells her. \"It's just Hadrik in his shapeshifted form. It's not a real dragon.\"<br/><br/>\"What's wrong, Kate?\" Hadrik says.

But if it's a dragon fight you want, then I have no objections.\"<br/><br/>Kate is now assembling her very own dragon out of sculpted ice, with a size to match that of Hadrik's. But this seems different from all of her other spells. The ice dragon that is now standing before us seems almost as if it were an actual living, breathing creature. This is on a whole other level compared to what she's cast before. She must really be going all out.<br/><br/>\"You may have the appearance of a dragon,\" Kate says. \"But you and I both know that shapeshifting does not grant you the ability to breathe fire, and you can't cast any fire spells while you are in that form either.

Kate's dragon follows him, and in the meantime, she starts building a cage of ice around herself, which she then uses to raise herself into the air, in order to get a better view of the fight.<br/>The two dragons are diving at each other and attacking with both their claws and their fangs. Kate's reinforced ice seems to be holding up rather well against Hadrik's attacks. I'm quite sure that Tyrath would have sliced through her ice dragon as through butter. I guess his 'king of all dragons' title was not just for show after all.<br/><br/>Kate is now ramping up her attacks by also shooting Hadrik with hundreds of icicles while her ice dragon is still on his tail. Every time that Hadrik tries to go for Kate, she moves her cage out of his way, and sends her ice dragon to intercept him. Some of the icicles hit the black dragon in his left wing, and he starts falling from the sky, as the ice dragon takes full advantage of this opportunity and dives right onto its opponent.<br/><br/>The two dragons crash on the ground, with the ice one on top, pinning the black one into place with its claws. Kate is now slowly descending as well, still in her ice cage, and she looks at Hadrik, waiting for his next move.<br/><br/>\"Okay, okay, I give up, you win!\" Hadrik says, as he transforms back into his dwarf form.<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, Kate brings her cage back down, and once she's safely on the ground, she dismisses both the cage and the dragon.<br/><br/> \"Does this mean that you'll grant me my request?\" Kate says, with a hopeful look in her eyes.<br/>\"Well, I can't say that I'm really looking forward to it, but a deal's a deal. Pack your bags, Kate, I'm going to lead you to your friend!\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you so much...\" Kate says. \"I have a lot of money with me, I promise I will make it worth your while.\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Hadrik asks her. \"I already said that we have a deal, didn't I?

He also seems to be able to completely ignore the traditional laws of magic. When we first met him, he just bypassed all of Daren's magical protections and put him to sleep with a simple wave of his hand. Oh, and one more thing. He appears to be virtually undetectable when he turns invisible. I couldn't even sense a hint of his magical aura when he was hiding his presence.\"<br/>\"Interesting...\" Azarius says, as he smashes his staff into the ground and I feel a wave of air hit me in the face. \"Well, unless he also found a way to completely eliminate his physical presence from this plane, we can rest assured that he at least isn't listening to our conversation right now. I just used a sonar spell to detect all objects and persons in the area, and we are the only mages in this clearing. I also have another question for you. Do you know if he has any enemies here on this continent?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, he does! Tyrath, the dragon I've fought in the sky a few hours ago was looking specifically for Eiden and wanted him dead. I believe that he's made an enemy of the lessathi as well. He told us to deliver a message to any ancients we find, and tell them to 'remember the still winter'. Given what I've heard you say about the still winter earlier, I can only assume that it's meant as a threat.\"<br/><br/> \"I see,\" the old sage says as he strokes his beard. \"This could prove to be invaluable information, if we are ever to make an enemy of him ourselves. The stillwater said earlier that he wasn't participating in the tournament, but it never hurts to be too careful. Thank you for sharing this with me.\"<br/>\"You're welcome,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"Master Azarius!\" the mage's pupil says, as he approaches us, holding a map in his hands.<br/><br/>\"Azarius,\" the sage says. \"Just call me Azarius.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, master Azarius.\"<br/><br/>The sage sighs.<br/><br/>\"Tell me, Henry, what is it?\"<br/><br/>\"I noticed that there is an unusually large concentration of magic around this area,\" Henry says, while pointing at the lower side of his map. \"Perhaps it could be what we are looking for?\"<br/><br/>\"Perhaps...\" Azarius says. \"At any rate,  it's not very far from here, so I suppose we could make it there before it gets too dark to see anything.

Goodbye, Henry!\" Rose says, as we all wave to them. \"I'm sure that our paths will cross again someday!\"<br/><br/>Henry looks back towards us with a surprised expression on his face. He probably isn't used to people acknowledging his existence as he travels alongside the Sage of the West.

Of course we are. Naturally!\"<br/><br/>\"What?...\" Kate says, shocked. \"No, Rose, you can't! What about all of the sick people waiting for you in your hometown?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that!\" Rose says. \"With all of the shortcuts we've been taking so far, I am days ahead of my original schedule. I would've never had the courage to take such a direct route if you hadn't been there to escort me. Accompanying you on your way to meet your friend is the least I can do to pay you back.

I couldn't...\" Kate starts to say, but Hadrik interrupts her.<br/><br/>\"It's settled then!\" he says loudly, completely drowning out the sound of Kate's voice. \"We all go to see Kate's friend! Now come on, follow me, I'm going to try and take a shortcut.\"<br/><br/>With these final words, we all grab our backpacks, and hurry up to follow Hadrik. Kate just stands there for a few moments, unsure of what to do, but then she decides to follow him too, and before long, she starts walking side by side with us again, as if our previous discussion never even took place.<br/><br/>We walk in complete silence for a few minutes. Kate has always been the silent type, so I'm not really surprised about her, but I don't think I've ever seen Daren go for more than a minute without opening his mouth. He must still be in shock after what he's heard about the Beacon. He's probably still having a hard time internalizing that information, given how adamantly he's been holding on to the opinion that Kate was a banshee until now.<br/><br/>\"Boy, you guys sure are a quiet bunch!\" Hadrik says, after a few more minutes of awkward silence. \"Fine, I'll break the ice, then.

But shapeshifting magic can only be used to modify your size or to transform yourself into another creature. You cannot use it to disguise yourself as someone else. So I figured that you needed to have some sort of reason to make yourself seem smaller than you actually were. It was then that I remembered your giant form from when you first called out to us. Normally it should be impossible for someone to transform himself into a giant, because it would break the laws of shapeshifting. That made me realize that it must have been the other way around, and that the giant form was actually your original form.\"<br/><br/>Hadrik laughs again.<br/><br/>\"Well, you found out my secret,\" he says. \"What are you going to do now? Will you report me to the organizers so that they can kick me out of the tournament? Are you going to use this information to blackmail me into helping you with the objectives?\"  <br/><br/> \"What?\" I ask him. \"No, don't be ridiculous. If I did any of that, then what were to stop you from also reporting me for having joined this mage tournament as an ordinary human? The reality is that the organizers likely just don't care. They didn't even bother to do some minimal screening of the contestants, and let hundreds of ordinary people like me join this tournament without even considering the implications. Why would they care if they also let in a giant or two?\"<br/>\"I think you may be right,\" Hadrik says. \"Well, I guess that's enough questions for now. If we go on like this, I may well end up giving away my home address. Hahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>As we advance through the forest, we start seeing some bright yellow lights circling around the trees.  <br/><br/>\"What are these, I wonder?\" I ask, as I point towards one of the yellow lights. \"Overgrown fireflies?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Rose says. \"Oh, no... This isn't good. We need to get out of this place as fast as possible.\"<br/><br/>\"Why?\" I ask her. \"What's wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"These aren't fireflies, they're spirits of the forest.

I'll finish them myself.\"<br/><br/>\"If you dare to lay even a finger on them, I will murder you here and now,\" Diane says.<br/><br/>\"You dare threaten me, wench? Don't you realize what position you are in?\"<br/><br/>\"Stop it, Zenir,\" says the man on the left as he puts his hand on the other's shoulder. \"You know full well that we are no match for her in battle. Come on, let's make preparations for our departure. We shouldn't linger here for much longer, now that our location has been compromised.\"<br/><br/> \"You're right,\" says Zenir as he calms down. \"We should get ready to leave here as soon as possible.\"<br/>He then points menacingly towards Diane and says:<br/><br/>\"Lady Meridith will hear of this, I assure you!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm counting on it,\" Diane says, smiling defiantly.<br/><br/>Zenir frowns, and then he goes to follow his ally back to their main camp.

That high a voltage should have normally made you all lose your consciousness. So why are you the only one that was able to maintain his awareness?\"<br/><br/>When she gets closer to me, she looks shocked for a brief moment, and then she smiles.<br/><br/>\"I see,\" she says. \"You are a lessathi.
