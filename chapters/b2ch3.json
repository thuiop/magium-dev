He was leaning on a wooden staff, with several dead trolls lying on the ground around him, and he was studying us closely, as we approached him. <br/><br/>His appearance shocked me at first, but when I saw Illuna nod to him, I immediately realized that he was the one that she brought us to meet. Illuna's friend was no taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, a crooked nose, pointy ears, and green skin. <br/><br/>I must admit that I wasn't expecting this friend of hers to be a goblin, but given the fact that Illuna is a banshee, I suppose that I shouldn't find it too strange that she'd have a few monster allies in Varathia. I've heard before that goblins are supposed to be really smart, compared to other monsters, but this goblin in particular has a very shrewd look about him, and his cunning grin reminds me of those slimy merchants that are constantly looking for new ways to rip you off. And he's not trying to hide it, either. <br/><br/> His high intelligence is likely a result of his old age, which I've heard is not an easy feat to achieve if you live your life as a goblin. Most goblins die young, either because of starvation, or because they get killed, while trying to steal food, in order to survive. Since they are considered monsters by other civilized races, they are forced to live from scraps, and often need to resort to illegal activities such as smuggling and stealing in order to get the goods they require. But this goblin's skin is all wrinkly, which means that he must have lived well over two hundred years, given how slowly goblins are known to age, compared to humans. Living this long as a goblin, especially in a place like Varathia, is definitely not something that you can achieve through sheer luck.<br/>\"Is this the lessathi you were talking about, Illuna?\" the goblin says, in the Common language, as he looks towards me.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"And the lessathi girl?\" the goblin asks. \"Is she from your group too?\"<br/><br/>\"The lessathi girl is apparently a teammate from his arena division,\" Illuna says. \"I only just met her, myself.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" the goblin says. \"If she's a gladiator, then I suppose I can safely assume that she has nothing to do with Meridith's group. I'll admit that I was a little worried, at first.\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on!\" I say. \"You're telling me that you can both tell she's a lessathi from just one glance?\"<br/><br/>",

She is a gladiator, after all.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, wait a minute!\" I tell Illuna. \"If we're talking about trust, then the same question goes for him as well. Just how much are you willing to trust this guy? To me, he looks just about as trustworthy as a swindler who would try to trick you into playing a rigged game of cards, on the main streets of Bagelberry.\"<br/><br/>The goblin laughs out loud, after hearing what I had to say about him.<br/><br/>\"I like this one,\" the goblin says. \"He speaks exactly what's on his mind without making any effort to sugar-coat his words.\"<br/><br/> \"To answer your question, Barry,\" Illuna says, \"I do not trust him at all. And he does not trust me, either. However, we are both smart enough to know that neither of us would benefit from betraying each other. The information he provides me with regarding the other monster races' activities is invaluable, and in return, I've been helping him from time to time, by ridding him of some of his enemies, or by joining him in covert missions such as this one.\"<br/>\"And what exactly is this covert mission that you are talking about?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"There is a minotaur being held here, in these tunnels,\" the goblin says. \"They call him the undefeated champion of the arena. You are supposed to be fighting him in the second round, provided you survive the first one. I want to make him an offer.\"<br/><br/>\"What offer?\" I ask.<br/><br/>\"I will offer him his freedom, if he agrees to join my goblin camp, and to be part of my army,\" the goblin says.<br/><br/>\"You have an army?\" I ask him, confused. \"I thought you were just some random goblin that was acting as Illuna's informant.\"<br/><br/>The goblin laughs again.<br/><br/>\"There really isn't any limit to your bluntness and disrespect, is there?\" the goblin says.<br/><br/>\"The goblin you are talking to is Fyron, the general of all free goblins,\" Illuna says, in a bored tone. \"He is at the top of the hierarchy of all the goblins from Varathia that are not under Tyrath's rule.\"<br/><br/> \"Tyrath?\" I ask. \"You mean the dragon that I fought on my second day here?\"<br/>\"The one and only,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"I am intrigued,\" Fyron says, as he strokes his chin, and he looks at me. \"I can't say that I've heard of many beings that fought Tyrath and lived to tell the tale. How exactly did you manage to escape his wrath?\"<br/><br/>",

It must have taken a very thorough understanding of the ins and outs of mind reading magic and years of hard work to make something this sophisticated. Whoever worked on your device must have been very talented.\"<br/><br/>\"He is,\" Leila writes, with a solemn look on her face.<br/><br/>\"So, uh,\" I say, \"why are you looking to invite the minotaur into your army? Are you planning to go to war against the dragon?\"<br/><br/> \"How intriguing,\" the goblin general says. \"You have absolutely nothing to gain from this information, yet you are casually asking me to divulge to you some of my most important military secrets without offering me anything in return. I know that you're not a spy, because no spy would be stupid enough to ask me something like this directly. So what is the reason behind this question, I wonder?\"<br/>\"I believe this is what humans like to call 'small talk',\" Illuna says, in her usual indifferent tone. \"Empty words, with the sole purpose of engaging in a conversation, for no reason in particular. Barry is just particularly bad at being discreet, so he never stopped to think whether his question was appropriate or not, for this situation.\"<br/><br/>\"Give me a break!\" I say. \"If you were so worried about me knowing your plans, then you would have never allowed me to find out about the minotaur in the first place. If you have any reason to think that I might somehow leak the information, then you can just tell me that you're looking to hire the minotaur as the army's accountant, and leave it at that. It's not like I can verify the information that you give me, anyway.\"<br/><br/> \"Ah, so you are not completely stupid after all,\" Fyron says, with a smirk. \"That is a relief. Well, in that case, as you've said, the minotaur will be joining our accounting team as soon as he completes his training program. I am expecting great things from him in the months to come.\"<br/>Arraka laughs.<br/><br/>\"If I were you,\" she says, \"I'd make the minotaur do the accounting anyway, just to mess with him. I hear that jobs that do not involve physical labor are considered to be the most dishonorable, by minotaur standards.\"<br/><br/>",

Please!\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" the goblin says, as he creates an orb of light with his staff, and then he makes it float all the way to the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Now that we get a clear look, we see that at the end of the corridor there is a locked cell, which holds only one prisoner: a tiger.<br/><br/>\"Were you the one calling out to us earlier?\" Fyron asks the tiger.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the tiger answers him. \"Please, let me out of here! I'll do whatever you ask!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" the goblin says, with a mocking smile. \"Are you certain that it's a good idea to be addressing us in Common like this?

One question that is always asked is if you'd spoken to any humans in Common, while you were away. There is no way to hide the truth from the great fox. As long as she is studying your aura, she can easily tell if you are lying or not. Even if I weren't an exile, like I said, going back to my homeland now would be nothing short of suicide. She would execute me on the spot.\"<br/><br/>\"I admit that I have heard of the fox's interrogations,\" Fyron says. \"But I assumed that she would make an exception for mages, and for other valuable members of her community.\"<br/><br/>\"The fox does not make exceptions,\" the tiger says, with a look in his eyes that seems to show both anger and terror at the same time. \"I used to think the same as you, before she murdered the leopard's son in cold blood.\"<br/><br/>\"The leopard?\" I say. \"You mean Leo, the leopard?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that is who I was referring to,\" the tiger says. \"He was her most loyal retainer. He still is. But that did not stop her from executing his cub, for the heinous crime of begging for his life in Common, to a couple of human hunters. The leopard may have accepted her judgment, but I never will.\"<br/><br/> The tiger pauses, for a few seconds, and then he repeats himself, in a lower voice.<br/>\"I never will,\" he says.<br/><br/>\"Ah,\" Fyron says, \"Now things are starting to make more sense. If the fox later also executed your family, in a similar manner to how she executed the leopard cub, I can see why you would choose to leave her domain forever. That would also explain why you left your homeland by yourself.\"<br/><br/>The tiger is looking pretty angry, after hearing the goblin's words, but he chooses to remain silent.<br/><br/>\"You've said enough,\" Fyron tells the tiger. \"At the very least, I would find it very unlikely that you would return to the golden fox after all you've just said. Regarding your debt to me, I ask only that you accompany me to my goblin camp on my way back. If the life there is not to your liking, then you may leave at any point, and consider your debt to me paid. I am, however, quite confident that you will choose to remain.\"<br/><br/>\"And why is that?\" the tiger asks.<br/><br/>\"You will understand, once you get there,\" Fyron says. \"Now, follow us. There is still another prisoner that we need to rescue before we can leave this place.\"<br/><br/>\"Another prisoner?\" the tiger asks, as he joins us, and we all resume our walk through the caves. \"You don't mean the minotaur, do you?\"<br/><br/>",

He swipes the wall briefly with his index finger, and then he brings the finger closer to his face, studying the black powder that has accumulated on the tip of it attentively.<br/><br/>\"Tell me, Arraka,\" the goblin says, \"are you sensing any trolls nearby?\"<br/><br/>\"What?\" Arraka says. \"No, I already told you that the coast is clear.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure?\" Fyron asks.<br/><br/>\"What kind of question is that?\" Arraka says. \"Of course I'm sure!\"<br/><br/> \"Oh?\" Fyron says. \"Then could you perhaps describe to me what lies beyond this black wall?\"<br/>\"Yeah, hold on a sec,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>For about ten seconds, we all wait silently for Arraka's answer.<br/><br/>\"Well?\" Fyron says. \"Weren't you going to describe to us what's on the other side?\"<br/><br/>\"There's... a bit of interference,\" Arraka says. \"I'm still working on it.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, then by all means,\" Fyron says, \"do not let this old goblin's ramblings interrupt you from your work. Please, take all the time you need.\"<br/><br/>It takes thirty more seconds of silence until Illuna finally snaps.<br/><br/>\"Good gods!\" she shouts. \"How long is it going to take you to admit the obvious? This wall is clearly made from a material that blocks magical sense. We can wait here all day, and you're still not going to get through it. Are you really that stubborn?\"<br/><br/>\"Fine!\" Arraka says. \"I admit it! I can't get through it. I have no idea what's on the other side. Are you happy now?\"<br/><br/>",

This type of black rock is not uncommon in underground caves such as this, and it is called 'seredium'. The owner of the arena must have chosen to build his labyrinth here specifically because of the existence of these rocks. There wouldn't be much point in making a labyrinth if people could just use their magical sense to see through walls, now would there?\"<br/><br/>As the goblin was talking, Leila was busy inspecting the floor of the cave, with a very focused look on her face. Fyron notices her, and he goes closer, in an attempt to figure out what she is studying so attentively.<br/><br/>\"Is there something special about this corridor's floor?\" Fyron asks her. <br/><br/>Leila nods. She then points towards a black spot on the ground, which is almost indistinguishable from the color of the rest of the floor.<br/><br/> \"This is no ordinary black stain,\" Leila writes. \"It is troll blood. Look, there's more over there. And there as well. The trail is fresh. If we follow the drops of blood, they might just lead us to the minotaur.\"<br/>\"Or the trolls could very well be baiting us, so that we walk directly into their ambush!\" the tiger says. \"Since when do trolls leave blood trails, anyway? Don't they have regeneration powers that heal all of their wounds in a matter of seconds?\"<br/><br/>\"Not all of them,\" Illuna says. \"The effectiveness of their regeneration varies from individual to individual. There are also certain types of wounds that heal slower than others. We have no way of knowing whether this trail was left deliberately or accidentally. Not that it matters, really. As long as we aim to reach the minotaur, we're going to run into the trolls sooner or later, whether we follow this trail or not.\"<br/><br/>",

Not that it would make much of a difference at this point.\"<br/><br/>",

You can find us there when you're done.\"<br/><br/>As the others head towards the minotaur, I prepare to lift one of the troll bodies, when I notice Leila walking to the other end of the corpse and then grabbing it by the legs.<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" I say to her, when I understand what she is doing. \"Thanks!\"<br/><br/>She smiles at me, and then we both grab the troll's body and carry it over to a nearby secret passage. There's not much we can do about all the blood on the floor, but given the darkness of the corridor, at least it will be harder to notice from a distance than a bunch of corpses lying in plain sight. Once we're done moving all the bodies and the heads into the passage, we close the secret door, and we hurry to catch up with the others. Just as we approach them, Fyron uses his staff to cast a spell on a magical panel from a wall. The panel fizzles, and it unlocks the gate of a cell near it.<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" the goblin says, as he sees me and Leila approach. \"You've arrived just in time!\"<br/><br/>With the gate now open, the prisoner inside the cell steps outside. He has the head of a bull and the body of a man, but he is taller than Daren and has twice the muscles. The minotaur takes a quick glance towards us as he gets out, and then he turns towards the goblin.<br/><br/>\"How are you planning to get me out of these caverns?\" the minotaur says.<br/><br/>",

Let's keep going.\"<br/>We make our way towards the end of the corridor, where we find a single cell, with a magical panel on the wall beside it. Inside the cell, there is only one prisoner, with the head of a bull, and the body of a man, laying on the floor, with his back against the wall. The minotaur is taller than Daren, and he has twice the muscles. When he hears us arrive, he does not move an inch, and he doesn't even turn his head to look at us.<br/><br/>\"Who are you?\" the minotaur asks.<br/><br/>\"I guess I was right when I figured that they'd place you in the old paralysis cell,\" Fyron says. \"The maze's only purpose was to keep the intruders out, not to keep you in.\"<br/><br/>\"Who are you?\" the minotaur asks again.<br/><br/>\"I am Fyron, the general of all free goblins in Varathia,\" Fyron says. \"I've come here to recruit you to join my army. What do you say?\"<br/><br/>\"A goblin army?\" the minotaur says.<br/><br/> He laughs bitterly.<br/>\"I never thought I'd live to see the day,\" the minotaur says, \"when I would actually seriously consider an offer like this.\" <br/><br/>\"It's not as bad as you might think,\" Fyron says. \"At the very least, in our goblin camp you should have access to more food than here, and you wouldn't have to spend your days locked up in a paralysis cell. Or would you rather spend the rest of your life entertaining these humans?\"<br/><br/>\"This goblin army of yours...\" the minotaur says. \"Is it made only of goblins? Or have you also recruited other warriors such as myself to join it before?\"<br/><br/>",

The way he looks and dresses would normally make me peg him as a noble, if it weren't for the look in his eyes, which is similar to that of the goblin general's. That look makes him seem more like a war veteran that has seen many battles in his lifetime, than a pampered rich person who's lived his life in luxury.<br/><br/>\"But, owner,\" Velgos, the troll says, \"these are the intruders who came here to free the minotaur! We need to eliminate them quick, before they let him escape to the surface!\"<br/><br/>\"The minotaur is already gone,\" the man says. \"I saw him teleport out of here with my own eyes. There is nothing else for you to do here. Return to your post.\"<br/><br/>\"I refuse!\" Velgos says, baring his teeth at his master. \"They are responsible for the deaths of many of my comrades. I am not going to let them go.\"<br/><br/> \"I'm not telling you to let them go,\" the owner says. \"I am only asking you to postpone your fight with them until the second round of the arena event. The minotaur is gone, and you are the only warrior we have who is on par with him, combat-wise. I will pay you handsomely if you join the fights in the arena, and you will also have your chance to avenge your fallen comrades, since these two will be participating in the fights. Wouldn't that be a better alternative for you than to lose your job needlessly because you lacked patience?\"<br/>The troll grumbles, but he does not seem like he wants to continue the argument.<br/><br/>\"They'd better not get killed by the creatures in the first round,\" Velgos says, as he points towards us. \"I want to kill them myself!\"<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't worry too much about that,\" the owner says. \"I'd say that they have very good chances of making it to the second round alive, based on what I've seen so far. Now, get going. I need to lead our guests back to their cells.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine,\" Velgos says. \"We'll discuss my payment later.\"<br/><br/>With these final words, the troll walks away from us, and he disappears into the darkness of the caverns.<br/><br/>\"You're going to lead us back to our cells?\" I ask the owner. \"Not that I'm complaining, but aren't you the arena's owner? Why would you let us go so easily?\"<br/><br/>",

Besides, it is well within your rights to come and sabotage the arena before the main event. In fact, I hear that this used to be something of a tradition before the still winter, when the lessathi were still in charge of this arena. It was even encouraged by the organizers. The secret trapdoor that led you from your cells to here is a proof of that fact. Now, don't just stand there, follow me. This tunnel will lead us to where we need to go.\"<br/>Leila and I exchange a look, and then we decide to follow the arena's owner into the newly revealed secret tunnel.<br/><br/>\"You know,\" the owner says, as the door closes itself behind us, \"I feel that I should thank you for the entertainment that you've provided me today.\"<br/><br/>\"You do?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the owner says. \"It is not every day that you get to see Illuna of the sacred woods massacre, Arraka of the still winter and general Fyron of the free goblins wreak havoc through a monster filled dungeon. I realize that you weren't the ones who brought them here, but I would never have found out about them, if I hadn't followed the two of you since you fell into that lake.\"<br/><br/>\"You've been following us from the very beginning?\" I ask him, shocked.<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" the owner says. \"There is an ancient alarm system that has been set up since the age of the lessathi, meant to warn me if anyone triggers the trap from the arena cells. I found you while you were drying up by the fire, and I have been following you from afar ever since.\"<br/>\"But how did you manage to remain undetected?\" I ask him. \"We even had Arraka with us, who could detect invisible enemies.\"<br/><br/>\"Your goblin friend is not the only one who knows about secret tunnels,\" the owner says. \"Over the years, I have built many such hidden corridors throughout these caverns, and I've had them covered with seredium dust, in order to make sure that I cannot be detected while I walk through them. I've also had an illusionist cast a spell on all the walls, which makes it so that you can see through them from inside the hidden tunnels, but not from the outside. This allowed me to watch the events unfold, without giving myself away.\"<br/><br/>\"So,\" I say, \"you've just been watching all this time, instead of stopping us? Why?\"<br/><br/>",
