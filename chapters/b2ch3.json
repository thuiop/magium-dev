He was leaning on a wooden staff, with several dead trolls lying on the ground around him, and he was studying us closely, as we approached him. <br/><br/>His appearance shocked me at first, but when I saw Illuna nod to him, I immediately realized that he was the one that she brought us to meet. Illuna's friend was no taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, a crooked nose, pointy ears, and green skin. <br/><br/>I must admit that I wasn't expecting this friend of hers to be a goblin, but given the fact that Illuna is a banshee, I suppose that I shouldn't find it too strange that she'd have a few monster allies in Varathia. I've heard before that goblins are supposed to be really smart, compared to other monsters, but this goblin in particular has a very shrewd look about him, and his cunning grin reminds me of those slimy merchants that are constantly looking for new ways to rip you off. And he's not trying to hide it, either. <br/><br/> His high intelligence is likely a result of his old age, which I've heard is not an easy feat to achieve if you live your life as a goblin. Most goblins die young, either because of starvation, or because they get killed, while trying to steal food, in order to survive. Since they are considered monsters by other civilized races, they are forced to live from scraps, and often need to resort to illegal activities such as smuggling and stealing in order to get the goods they require. But this goblin's skin is all wrinkly, which means that he must have lived well over two hundred years, given how slowly goblins are known to age, compared to humans. Living this long as a goblin, especially in a place like Varathia, is definitely not something that you can achieve through sheer luck.<br/>\"Is this the lessathi you were talking about, Illuna?\" the goblin says, in the Common language, as he looks towards me.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"And the lessathi girl?\" the goblin asks. \"Is she from your group too?\"<br/><br/>\"The lessathi girl is apparently a teammate from his arena division,\" Illuna says. \"I only just met her, myself.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" the goblin says. \"If she's a gladiator, then I suppose I can safely assume that she has nothing to do with Meridith's group. I'll admit that I was a little worried, at first.\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on!\" I say. \"You're telling me that you can both tell she's a lessathi from just one glance?\"<br/><br/>",

She is a gladiator, after all.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, wait a minute!\" I tell Illuna. \"If we're talking about trust, then the same question goes for him as well. Just how much are you willing to trust this guy? To me, he looks just about as trustworthy as a swindler who would try to trick you into playing a rigged game of cards, on the main streets of Bagelberry.\"<br/><br/>The goblin laughs out loud, after hearing what I had to say about him.<br/><br/>\"I like this one,\" the goblin says. \"He speaks exactly what's on his mind without making any effort to sugar-coat his words.\"<br/><br/> \"To answer your question, Barry,\" Illuna says, \"I do not trust him at all. And he does not trust me, either. However, we are both smart enough to know that neither of us would benefit from betraying each other. The information he provides me with regarding the other monster races' activities is invaluable, and in return, I've been helping him from time to time, by ridding him of some of his enemies, or by joining him in covert missions such as this one.\"<br/>\"And what exactly is this covert mission that you are talking about?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"There is a minotaur being held here, in these tunnels,\" the goblin says. \"They call him the undefeated champion of the arena. You are supposed to be fighting him in the second round, provided you survive the first one. I want to make him an offer.\"<br/><br/>\"What offer?\" I ask.<br/><br/>\"I will offer him his freedom, if he agrees to join my goblin camp, and to be part of my army,\" the goblin says.<br/><br/>\"You have an army?\" I ask him, confused. \"I thought you were just some random goblin that was acting as Illuna's informant.\"<br/><br/>The goblin laughs again.<br/><br/>\"There really isn't any limit to your bluntness and disrespect, is there?\" the goblin says.<br/><br/>\"The goblin you are talking to is Fyron, the general of all free goblins,\" Illuna says, in a bored tone. \"He is at the top of the hierarchy of all the goblins from Varathia that are not under Tyrath's rule.\"<br/><br/> \"Tyrath?\" I ask. \"You mean the dragon that I fought on my second day here?\"<br/>\"The one and only,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"I am intrigued,\" Fyron says, as he strokes his chin, and he looks at me. \"I can't say that I've heard of many beings that fought Tyrath and lived to tell the tale. How exactly did you manage to escape his wrath?\"<br/><br/>",

It must have taken a very thorough understanding of the ins and outs of mind reading magic and years of hard work to make something this sophisticated. Whoever worked on your device must have been very talented.\"<br/><br/>\"He is,\" Leila writes, with a solemn look on her face.<br/><br/>\"So, uh,\" I say, \"why are you looking to invite the minotaur into your army? Are you planning to go to war against the dragon?\"<br/><br/> \"How intriguing,\" the goblin general says. \"You have absolutely nothing to gain from this information, yet you are casually asking me to divulge to you some of my most important military secrets without offering me anything in return. I know that you're not a spy, because no spy would be stupid enough to ask me something like this directly. So what is the reason behind this question, I wonder?\"<br/>\"I believe this is what humans like to call 'small talk',\" Illuna says, in her usual indifferent tone. \"Empty words, with the sole purpose of engaging in a conversation, for no reason in particular. Barry is just particularly bad at being discreet, so he never stopped to think whether his question was appropriate or not, for this situation.\"<br/><br/>\"Give me a break!\" I say. \"If you were so worried about me knowing your plans, then you would have never allowed me to find out about the minotaur in the first place. If you have any reason to think that I might somehow leak the information, then you can just tell me that you're looking to hire the minotaur as the army's accountant, and leave it at that. It's not like I can verify the information that you give me, anyway.\"<br/><br/> \"Ah, so you are not completely stupid after all,\" Fyron says, with a smirk. \"That is a relief. Well, in that case, as you've said, the minotaur will be joining our accounting team as soon as he completes his training program. I am expecting great things from him in the months to come.\"<br/>Arraka laughs.<br/><br/>\"If I were you,\" she says, \"I'd make the minotaur do the accounting anyway, just to mess with him.

Please!\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" the goblin says, as he creates an orb of light with his staff, and then he makes it float all the way to the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Now that we get a clear look, we see that at the end of the corridor there is a locked cell, which holds only one prisoner: a tiger.<br/><br/>\"Were you the one calling out to us earlier?\" Fyron asks the tiger.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the tiger answers him. \"Please, let me out of here! I'll do whatever you ask!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" the goblin says, with a mocking smile. \"Are you certain that it's a good idea to be addressing us in Common like this?

One question that is always asked is if you'd spoken to any humans in Common, while you were away. There is no way to hide the truth from the great fox. As long as she is studying your aura, she can easily tell if you are lying or not. Even if I weren't an exile, like I said, going back to my homeland now would be nothing short of suicide. She would execute me on the spot.\"<br/><br/>\"I admit that I have heard of the fox's interrogations,\" Fyron says. \"But I assumed that she would make an exception for mages, and for other valuable members of her community.\"<br/><br/>\"The fox does not make exceptions,\" the tiger says, with a look in his eyes that seems to show both anger and terror at the same time. \"I used to think the same as you, before she murdered the leopard's son in cold blood.\"<br/><br/>\"The leopard?\" I say. \"You mean Leo, the leopard?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that is who I was referring to,\" the tiger says. \"He was her most loyal retainer. He still is. But that did not stop her from executing his cub, for the heinous crime of begging for his life in Common, to a couple of human hunters. The leopard may have accepted her judgment, but I never will.\"<br/><br/> The tiger pauses, for a few seconds, and then he repeats himself, in a lower voice.<br/>\"I never will,\" he says.<br/><br/>\"Ah,\" Fyron says, \"Now things are starting to make more sense. If the fox later also executed your family, in a similar manner to how she executed the leopard cub, I can see why you would choose to leave her domain forever. That would also explain why you left your homeland by yourself.\"<br/><br/>The tiger is looking pretty angry, after hearing the goblin's words, but he chooses to remain silent.<br/><br/>\"You've said enough,\" Fyron tells the tiger. \"At the very least, I would find it very unlikely that you would return to the golden fox after all you've just said. Regarding your debt to me, I ask only that you accompany me to my goblin camp on my way back. If the life there is not to your liking, then you may leave at any point, and consider your debt to me paid. I am, however, quite confident that you will choose to remain.\"<br/><br/>\"And why is that?\" the tiger asks.<br/><br/>\"You will understand, once you get there,\" Fyron says. \"Now, follow us.

As the tunnel's exit draws closer, Illuna reopens Arraka's amulet, and she asks her if she can spot any enemies nearby.<br/><br/>\"Oh, so now you want me to talk?\" Arraka says. \"You're not going to close the amulet in my face anymore? Well, what if I don't want to talk? What do you say to that?\"<br/><br/>\"If you're not planning to talk, then I have no further need of you,\" Illuna says, as she starts to close back the amulet. \"Have a good nap.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, wait, wait!\" Arraka says, just as Illuna was about to close the amulet completely. \"Okay, fine! You win! There are some trolls much further down the next tunnel, but they're not in viewing range of the maze's entrance. The coast is clear.\"<br/><br/>",

I'm much more inclined to believe that they've become aware of our presence, and that they deliberately emptied the next tunnel, in order to lure us into the maze.\"<br/>\"That changes little,\" Fyron says. \"The only way to reach the minotaur is through the maze. If the trolls choose to stand in our way, then we'll just have to make our way through them.\"<br/><br/>Once we reach the next corridor, we make sure that the coast is indeed clear, and then we proceed to enter the maze. The walls inside the labyrinth look a bit different from all the rocky walls that we've seen in the caverns so far. They are black as coal, and they appear to be made from a different material.<br/><br/>Fyron, who seems to have spotted the difference as well, gets closer to one of the walls, and he looks at it curiously. He swipes the wall briefly with his index finger, and then he brings the finger closer to his face, studying the black powder that has accumulated on the tip of it attentively.<br/><br/>\"Tell me, Arraka,\" the goblin says, \"are you sensing any trolls nearby?\"<br/><br/>\"What?\" Arraka says. \"No, I already told you that the coast is clear.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure?\" Fyron asks.<br/><br/>\"What kind of question is that?\" Arraka says. \"Of course I'm sure!\"<br/><br/> \"Oh?\" Fyron says. \"Then could you perhaps describe to me what lies beyond this black wall?\"<br/>\"Yeah, hold on a sec,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>For about ten seconds, we all wait silently for Arraka's answer.<br/><br/>\"Well?\" Fyron says. \"Weren't you going to describe to us what's on the other side?\"<br/><br/>\"There's... a bit of interference,\" Arraka says. \"I'm still working on it.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, then by all means,\" Fyron says, \"do not let this old goblin's ramblings interrupt you from your work. Please, take all the time you need.\"<br/><br/>It takes thirty more seconds of silence until Illuna finally snaps.<br/><br/>\"Good gods!\" she shouts. \"How long is it going to take you to admit the obvious? This wall is clearly made from a material that blocks magical sense. We can wait here all day, and you're still not going to get through it. Are you really that stubborn?\"<br/><br/>\"Fine!\" Arraka says. \"I admit it! I can't get through it. I have no idea what's on the other side. Are you happy now?\"<br/><br/>",

This type of black rock is not uncommon in underground caves such as this, and it is called 'seredium'. The owner of the arena must have chosen to build his labyrinth here specifically because of the existence of these rocks. There wouldn't be much point in making a labyrinth if people could just use their magical sense to see through walls, now would there?\"<br/><br/>As the goblin was talking, Leila was busy inspecting the floor of the cave, with a very focused look on her face. Fyron notices her, and he goes closer, in an attempt to figure out what she is studying so attentively.<br/><br/>\"Is there something special about this corridor's floor?\" Fyron asks her. <br/><br/>Leila nods. She then points towards a black spot on the ground, which is almost indistinguishable from the color of the rest of the floor.<br/><br/> \"This is no ordinary black stain,\" Leila writes. \"It is troll blood. Look, there's more over there. And there as well. The trail is fresh. If we follow the drops of blood, they might just lead us to the minotaur.\"<br/>\"Or the trolls could very well be baiting us, so that we walk directly into their ambush!\" the tiger says. \"Since when do trolls leave blood trails, anyway? Don't they have regeneration powers that heal all of their wounds in a matter of seconds?\"<br/><br/>\"Not all of them,\" Illuna says. \"The effectiveness of their regeneration varies from individual to individual. There are also certain types of wounds that heal slower than others. We have no way of knowing whether this trail was left deliberately or accidentally. Not that it matters, really. As long as we aim to reach the minotaur, we're going to run into the trolls sooner or later, whether we follow this trail or not.\"<br/><br/>",

Did they not teach you proper gladiator etiquette when they brought you to the arena?\"<br/><br/>His body then picks up his head from the ground, and it places it back on top of its neck. Within seconds, the head attaches itself back to its body, making it look as if there had never been a wound in the first place.<br/><br/> \"A troll that doesn't die even when you cut his head off?\" Fyron says. \"This is not what I signed up for. Illuna, use the cage spell.\"<br/>\"I can only use that spell once per day,\" Illuna says. \"If I use it now--\"<br/><br/>\"It doesn't matter,\" Fyron says. \"You won't need to use it later. I have a plan. Cage him, now!\"<br/><br/>Illuna frowns at him, but she does as he asked. She stretches her arm towards the troll, and out of nowhere, a golden cage appears around him, trapping him inside. It is the same spell that she used to trap us when we were at the ogre fort. The golden fox's spell.<br/><br/>",

Once we are all through, Fyron smacks his staff into the cave's wall from the inside, and the hole in the wall closes itself back up. He then makes his way past us, to retake the lead, and he smacks his staff on the other end of the passage, opening another secret door, which leads us into an unexplored corridor, without any markings on the walls.<br/><br/> \"That cage isn't going to hold him for long,\" Illuna says, as we all make our way out of the passage, and the secret door closes itself behind us. \"Would you mind telling me what this plan of yours is?\"<br/>\"He doesn't need to be held for long,\" Fyron says, \"I very much doubt that he knows about the existence of that secret passage, so he's not going to find us anytime soon. More importantly, I recognized that corridor from earlier, and I recognize this one as well. It seems that they've kept some of the old corridors, and included them in the labyrinth, when they built this place. If that's the case, then I think I have a pretty good idea of where we are, and the minotaur's cell should not be far from here. Follow me.\"<br/><br/>",

I learned it from Arraka.\"<br/><br/>\"I see...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Hah, I was wondering why I didn't remember there being a wall on this side!\" Fyron says.<br/><br/>As we turn to him, we see him walk straight through one of the walls, disappearing from our sights. <br/><br/>\"Come over here!\" Fyron shouts, from the other side. \"The wall is an illusion. This is how they must have been fooling us for so long. If they've got illusions like this set up, then I wouldn't put it past them to also have a spell cast on this place that messes with our sense of direction. That would explain why Arraka's map didn't help. It doesn't matter, though. If my intuition is correct, we should be almost there.\"<br/><br/> We all walk through the illusory wall, and we continue our journey towards the minotaur. A few minutes later, when we were almost at our destination, we encountered a few more trolls, who were likely the ones chosen to guard the minotaur's cell. They barely got the time to react to our presence, before Illuna sliced their heads off, with her signature water whip.<br/>\"Aren't you going to burn the bodies?\" I ask the goblin.<br/><br/>\"I'm not wasting any more energy from my staff for something this trivial,\" Fyron says. \"If you want, you can hide the bodies yourself.

There's not much we can do about all the blood on the floor, but given the darkness of the corridor, at least it will be harder to notice from a distance than a bunch of corpses lying in plain sight. Once we're done moving all the bodies and the heads into the passage, we close the secret door, and we hurry to catch up with the others. Just as we approach them, Fyron uses his staff to cast a spell on a magical panel from a wall. The panel fizzles, and it unlocks the gate of a cell near it.<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" the goblin says, as he sees me and Leila approach. \"You've arrived just in time!\"<br/><br/>With the gate now open, the prisoner inside the cell steps outside.

Since the warrior they were talking about is clearly the healer in armor, I can only assume that the scrawny human was you?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch5_goblins || 0) == 1 && (locals.v_b2_ch3_troll || 0) == 1) {%> \"Yeah, that was me,\" I say.<br/>\"Hmm...\" Fyron says, giving me a curious look for a few seconds. \"Well, the four goblins said that they were very eager to meet you again, so if you ever find your way into our goblin camp, be sure to drop by their house. I'm certain that they will be of help to you in one way or another.\"<br/><br/>\"Sure thing,\" I say. \"If I ever have business there, I will pay them a visit.\"<br/><br/>Fyron nods, and he prepares to cast his teleportation spell.<br/><br/>\"I wish you both luck,\" the goblin says. \"Next time we meet, I hope it will be under better circumstances.\"<br/><br/>He then casts his spell, and he vanishes into thin air, alongside the tiger and the troll. Leila and I waste no time, and we enter the secret tunnel, as the door shuts itself behind us. <br/><br/>\"You have some very... unique friends,\" Leila writes, smiling, as we walk through the dark corridor.<br/><br/><% } %>",

But I guess that seeing a goblin is far less shocking than seeing two banshees on the same day.\"<br/><br/>I pause for a few seconds, and then I change the subject.<br/><br/>\"So, uh... why didn't you accept the goblin's offer, earlier?\" I ask her. \"Is it because you didn't trust him?\"  <br/><br/>\"Oh, no, it's not that,\" Leila writes. \"It's just that I never intended to break out of here.\"<br/><br/>\"Why not?\" I say. \"Couldn't you just run past all the guards in the city, now that your wounds are healed?\"<br/><br/>Leila shakes her head.<br/><br/>\"The lessathi that framed my father are watching me carefully,\" she writes. \"As long as I survive the arena, the charges against me will be dropped, and they won't be able to touch me, but if I escape illegally, they will use all of the means at their disposal to hunt me down. I would never make it to the city gates alive.\"<br/><br/> \"You are saying that you'd rather fight the creatures from the arena,\" I say, \"than have a direct confrontation with the lessathi from this city?\"<br/>\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"The lessathi have powerful artifacts that allow them to use magic, similar to the staff that the goblin general was using. At least in the arena nobody is allowed to use magic, so as long as I have my stat device, I can stand a chance.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I guess I see your point,\" I say. \"Speaking of stat devices, I think we should pull them out to light this place up a bit. The goblin did say that there might be traps around here, so we should watch our step.\"<br/><br/>We walk down the dark tunnel for a few minutes, carefully checking every step of the way for traps, or enemy ambushes. As we step into a larger area, lit by the glowing blue crystals that we've seen before, we realize that all of our efforts to spot hidden ambushes have been wasted, because the enemy was waiting for us here, in this very room, without making any effort at hiding themselves.<br/><br/>",

The way he looks and dresses would normally make me peg him as a noble, if it weren't for the look in his eyes, which is similar to that of the goblin general's. That look makes him seem more like a war veteran that has seen many battles in his lifetime, than a pampered rich person who's lived his life in luxury.<br/><br/>\"But, owner,\" Velgos, the troll says, \"these are the intruders who came here to free the minotaur! We need to eliminate them quick, before they let him escape to the surface!\"<br/><br/>\"The minotaur is already gone,\" the man says. \"I saw him teleport out of here with my own eyes.

Now, get going.

I've also had an illusionist cast a spell on all the walls, which makes it so that you can see through them from inside the hidden tunnels, but not from the outside.
