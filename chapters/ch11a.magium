"You're the stillwater who obliterated the entire city of Olmnar with one flick of his fingers?" I ask Eiden.

"I am indeed," Eiden answers.

"But didn't that happen like... twenty years ago?" I say. "Just how old are you, exactly?"

Eiden pauses a bit to think.

"To be honest, I sort of lost track a few hundred years ago," he says. "The calendars have changed at least five times since I was born, so I have absolutely no idea what year we'd be in according to the old calendar. The closest approximation I can give you is that I'm somewhere in my early six hundreds."

"You're... more than six hundred years old?" I ask him.

"Yes, that's what I just said," Eiden says. "Try to pay attention."

"How could you?..." Flower asks Eiden, while a tear flows from her eye. "How could you kill all those people? What did the people of Olmnar ever do to you?!"

"To me?" Eiden says. "Nothing. But the people of Olmnar were the first ones who started hunting animals as a sport. They are the sole reason for the whole war that has started between the animals and the humans. They needed to be punished."

 "Punished?" Flower asks, as her eyes turn red with rage once more. "They all needed to be punished?! Even the elderly? Even the kids? Who gave you the right?! If anyone's, it should have been Eleya's decision to make, not yours!"
"Oh, right, the old fox!" Eiden says. "I'd almost forgotten why I came here in the first place."

He turns to me.

"Barry," Eiden says, "did you know that the golden fox cast a tracking spell on all of you before you left the lessathi ruins?"

"A tracking spell?" I ask. "Why would she do that?"

"I do not know!" Eiden says. "But I'm suspecting that she must have taken an interest in you as well!" 

He then starts moving his index finger through the air, as if he were pushing some invisible buttons in front of him. After a while, a golden light starts shining brightly all around us, and a hologram of the fox's head appears in front of us, soon afterwards.

"Eiden?" Eleya says. "Eiden, is that you?"

"Hello, old friend," Eiden says. "Did you miss me?"

"Eiden, what are you doing?" the fox says. "Stop this at once!"

The stillwater pays her no mind, and he continues to fiddle around with her spell, until he grabs onto what seems to be a golden string, made of solid light.

 "Eiden!" Eleya shouts. "Eiden, don't you DARE!"
Eiden smiles and waves at the fox, as he pulls on the golden string, and both the light surrounding us and the fox's head quickly disappear, with a loud clinking noise.

 "Was that it?" I ask Eiden. "Did you deactivate the spell?"
"Yes, but the spell is set to reactivate itself if its targets remain in the same area for too long," Eiden says. "I believe I overheard you saying that you were headed towards the city of Thilias, were you not? Allow me to give you a ride to your destination. Free of charge!"

He snaps his fingers, and I suddenly feel my whole body compressing itself into a single point, as all of my senses fade for one brief moment, and when I wake up, I find myself standing in front of a huge stone wall that seems to spread for as far as the eye can see.

I turn to Rose, who seems to have recovered from her violent coughing, and who is now measuring up the walls with her eyes.

"Rose, is this..." I start to ask, but Rose answers me before I finish my question.

"Yes," she says. "The city of Thilias. He wasn't lying. He really teleported us to our destination..."

"Rose!" Daren shouts, as he rushes towards us.

Apparently, the paralysis effect has worn off, because Kate and Hadrik have also gotten up, and are now slowly approaching us as well.

"Rose, are you alright?" Daren says. "Do you need healing?"

"No, I'm fine..." Rose says. "I only got a big scare out of it, nothing serious!"

 "Arraka," I say, as I now look towards Flower's amulet. "Do you sense Eiden anywhere around us? Is he hiding invisibly again?"
"No, he didn't teleport here with the rest of us," Arraka says.

"Could you let us know if you ever sense Eiden hiding invisibly around us again?" I say.

"Yeah, sure, no problem," Arraka says.

"Really?" I ask, surprised. "Just like that?"

"Just like that," Arraka says. "As long as I get to piss Eiden off, it's time well spent for me." 

"So, I'm guessing you and Eiden have a history, then?" I ask.

"Oh, yeah, him and I go way back," Arraka says.

"Is that so?..." I say.

"Flower..." Kate says, as she comes closer. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," Flower says, curtly, as she wipes the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand.

"Do you need to talk, or--" Kate starts to say but Flower interrupts her.

"I'm FINE!" Flower shouts.

 "Oh, yes, you definitely look fine to me!"
Flower frowns at me.

"I'm not stupid," she says. "I know you're making fun of me. I also know that all of us combined wouldn't stand a chance against Eiden if he were to go all out. I KNOW that! But even so, I couldn't just stand there and do nothing!"

"If it makes you feel any better," Daren says. "I acted much the same as you the first time I met Eiden, and I didn't even have a personal grudge against him like you do."

"You did?" Flower asks.

"Yeah," Daren says. "I already knew that I couldn't stand a chance against him, but I charged at him like a bull, regardless, and the bastard just put me to sleep with a single motion of his hand."

 "You, there!" we hear a city guard shout, as he rushes towards us. "What is your business here? Identify yourselves!"
"It's okay, Ralph!" Rose says, smiling. "They're with me!"

As the guard approaches, I see a warning message in front of my eyes, telling me not to hurt him because he's a local. I then get the same message for one of the guard's colleagues, who remained near the gates.

"Rose, thank the gods you're back!" Ralph says. "The whole oildrip situation has only gotten worse while you were gone. The entire Sparrow's district has now been quarantined."

The guard then looks at each of us in turn.

"I'm guessing you folks are the ones I should thank for bringing Rose back home safely," he says. "You all have my deepest gratitude! Our town would not be the same without her."

"Is there anything I should know about before heading over to the Sparrow's district, Ralph?" Rose says.

"Yeah," Ralph says. "Nurse Martha said she needed to talk to you as soon as you came back. You should drop by her tent before doing anything else."

"Alright," Rose says. "I'll be sure to go there as soon as I lead my new friends to my house, then. Thanks for letting me know!"

 "Maybe we should take a small break before we enter the city."
"We could do that," Rose says. "I'm already days ahead of my schedule. A few more hours won't make much of a difference."

"You hear that, Flower?" I say. "We can just--"

I suddenly notice that the girl moved away while I wasn't looking, and that she's currently heading towards the city gates.

"Hey, Flower, wait up!" I say, as I catch up to her.

"Leave me alone," Flower says.

"Hey, now, is that any way to talk to--"

 After finishing his conversation with us, Ralph waved to his colleague, and the latter then opened the city gates to let us through. 
As we entered the city, I was surprised to see that instead of luxurious manors and villas, we were greeted by broken down, wooden houses, and a stench that could even drive off a skunk. Most people on the streets were dressed in rags, and they were all looking at us with an uneasy look in their eyes, as we passed them by. Naturally, every single one of them had a warning message floating above their head, telling me that I couldn't harm them.

"Forgive me for maybe coming off as ignorant, Rose," Daren says, after we walk down the city's streets for a while. "but aren't the towns of Varathia supposed to represent the peak of human civilization?"

"They do," Rose says. "But this is the Beggar's district. We entered through the eastern gate, but the nobles and the royalty mostly only use the western gate when they come into the city, and they rarely, if ever, set foot in this area."

"Your towns are divided according to the amount of wealth each individual possesses?" Daren asks, shocked.

"Yes," Rose says. "Isn't it the same on the other continents?"

"No, of course not!" Daren says. "That would only further increase the disparity between the rich and the poor, and cause unnecessary conflict between them!"

"Oh, in Varathia, most of the poor people are too afraid to seek conflict with the nobles, because in doing that, they'd only be endangering their entire families."

 "Their families? Aren't there laws against this sort of thing?"
"There are!" Rose says. "But the nobles aren't subjected to them."

"That sounds terrible!" Daren says. "I cannot even begin to imagine the amount of discrimination that these people are faced with every day of their lives because of these unfair laws. How can this be allowed to happen?"

"Uh, well..." Rose says. "Technically, it's the nobles and the royalty who are allowing it to happen, so obviously they don't really have a problem with the way things are right now. You guys really live in a completely different world from us, don't you?"

All of a sudden, Flower, who hasn't really spoken a word since we entered the city, gasps loudly and puts both her hands over her mouth.

"Oh, gods!" she says. "I completely forgot! I needed to buy a new chain for Arraka's amulet. Can you guys wait for me here? I'm pretty sure that there was a shop that had what I wanted somewhere near the city gates."

"Well, hurry up, then!" Hadrik says. "I wouldn't want to spend more time here than is absolutely necessary. This place gives me the creeps."

As Flower hurries off to the shop, Hadrik starts to look around for something to do while he waits.

 "Hey, Daren," Hadrik says. "There's an armor shop right over there, by the corner. Wanna come see what they've got? This might be the perfect opportunity for you to finally get rid of that ugly breastplate of yours!"
"I'll pass," Daren says, with an acid tone in his voice.

"Suit yourself," Hadrik says with a grin, and he goes to enter the armor shop.

"You two really don't get along, do you?" Kate asks Daren.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Daren says. "Hadrik and I get along just fine."

"Right..." Kate says.

As we all stand there and wait, we suddenly hear a girl's scream coming from our right.  When we turn around, we see that a large man in his fifties is currently brutally beating a fifteen year old girl, in the middle of the street. Judging by his extravagant clothing and the jewelry around his neck, he would seem to be one of the local nobles, or maybe even royalty. 

 The girl is dressed in rags, but not the sort of rags that would be worn by the people we've seen so far in the Beggar's district. These clothes of hers look much more worn-down, and it doesn't appear like there's been any effort put into making them look aesthetically pleasing even when they were new. Leaving her clothes aside, what is really strange here is that the girl doesn't seem to offer any sort of resistance while she is getting beaten. She does not raise her hands to defend herself, she does not try to run, and she's not calling for help. What's more, the people on the streets are simply passing them by and ignoring them, as if nothing was happening.

 "Your nobles are starting to sound less like nobles, and more like a gang of thugs."  
"I, uh..." Rose says, as she starts to look around, anxiously. "I wouldn't say those kinds of things out loud if I were you..."

"What are they going to do?" I ask. "Put me in jail for stating my opinion?"

"Yes, actually," Rose says. "You guys really live in a completely different world from us, don't you?"

All of a sudden, Flower, who hasn't really spoken a word since we entered the city, gasps loudly and puts both her hands over her mouth.

 "What the hell is wrong with everyone?" Daren says. "They're all acting like this is perfectly normal. I can't just stand around here and watch things go on like this. I'm going to teach that fat bastard a lesson he'll never forget."
"Daren, wait!" Rose says, as she grabs him by the arm. "You can't! That man is related to one of the kings of Varathia, and that girl is his slave. She is his rightful property!"

"She's his... what?" Daren says, as his look darkens.

Rose hesitates for a second, when she sees the look in his eyes.

"That girl is a slave..." Rose continues. "She doesn't have any rights, or freedoms. That man is legally  entitled to use her in any way he wishes, and to dispose of her whenever he sees fit."

Daren just stands there and looks at Rose for a few seconds, as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing.

"You're saying this is normal?!" Daren asks her, furious. "Treating another person like this? Like they were nothing more than an object? Do you find this normal, Rose?!"

Rose opens her mouth to speak, but no words come out for a few seconds.

 "Regardless of whether I'm finding any of this normal or not," Rose says, with a shaky voice, "the fact remains that the tournament rules still prohibit you from attacking any of the locals. You saw what happened to that mage who tried to attack me in the forest. You'll just get teleported out of here before you even get the chance to do anything."
Daren clenches his fist, as his hand starts shaking with rage, but he is unable to come up with a proper retort. Instead, he decides to turn his head away from her, and to continue watching the gruesome scene that was unraveling before our eyes. 

"I'm sorry," the girl says, as the man beats her mercilessly. "Please, I'm sorry!"

"I didn't ask for your apologies, you little wench," the man says, as he looks at her now swollen face with disgust. "I asked for you to be useful. How am I supposed to expect anything from you if you can't even carry a few bags?"

Now that he mentions it, I realize that there are at least ten bags full of clothes and groceries lying on the ground next to the girl. They must weigh a ton.

 "Sir, please!" the girl begs, on her knees. "I barely got to sleep at all while I was at the slave market, and I haven't even rested for one minute since you bought me this morning. If only you'd give me a few hours to regain my strength--"
The noble grabs the girl by her hair and lifts her head, in order to look her straight in the eye.

"So you're saying it's my fault that you're so useless?" he says. "Is that it?"

"N-n-no, sir!" the girl says, terrified. "I would never..."

"Maybe I should just gut you right here and now, and find me a proper slave," the man says. "One that can carry a few bags. One that doesn't talk back. After all, I only paid ten silvers for you. That's practically pocket change for me."

"No, please!" the girl says, now starting to cry. "I promise I won't talk back anymore! I promise I'll be good! Just give me another chance!"

"Do you see now, Daren?" we hear Eiden's voice coming from behind us.

"You!" Daren says, unable to contain his fury as he sees Eiden's face.

 "Do you see the true face of the humanity you are so desperately trying to protect?" Eiden says. "Take a look around you. Any of these people passing by could easily overpower that clown and save the girl. But they won't do it. Some of them would tell you that they're just obeying the law. Others would have you believe that they're only doing it to protect their families. But we all know what the real reason is. They're ignoring her because it's convenient. Because it's easier to lie to themselves and carry on with their lives than to face reality and try to give some meaning to their miserable existence."
Upon hearing Eiden's words, Rose lowers her head, and she starts staring at the ground in silence.

"But you're not like them, are you, Daren?" Eiden continues. "I'm sure you would have jumped to save that poor girl in an instant, were it not for the tournament's spell protecting the noble."

"Shut up," Daren says.

"It's quite a pity, isn't it?" Eiden says. "The fact that you're forced to stand here and do nothing, because of one meager spell."

Eiden smiles.

"What if I were to tell you, Daren, that I had a way to circumvent that spell?" he says.

"I'd say that you were out of your mind," Daren says.

Eiden laughs.

 "You don't have to take my word for it," he says. "Once I give you the power, you'll know that it's true. All you need to do is ask. Ask me for the power, Daren, and I will give it to you without asking for anything in return."
"You must have gone completely insane if you're actually thinking that I'd ever consider asking you for a favor!" Daren says.

"Oh?" Eiden says. "Then I suppose that you're content in leaving that girl to her fate, while you walk away like all the others?"

Daren clenches his fist and bites his lip, but he doesn't say anything.

"I'm going to show you that you're wrong," Daren says. "There is some good to be found in any person. Even in someone as rotten as this noble."

He then storms towards the noble and the slave without saying another word. The slave was now desperately trying to lift all of the bags from the ground, but she kept dropping them no matter how many times she shifted the weight between her hands. The noble had gotten tired of her repeated failures, and was just about to hit her again, but he got interrupted by Daren shouting at him.

"Wait!" Daren says, as he reaches him. "You're hurting her!"

The noble stands there and looks at Daren for a few seconds, as if frozen.

"What are you, some kind of clown?" the noble says. "Or perhaps you get paid to state the obvious to people? What are you going to tell me next? That the sky is blue? That the sun rises from the east?"

 "Don't you understand?!" Daren says. "She's human, just like you! She bleeds like you, she feels pain like you, she can get scared, she can be happy or sad. How can you do this to a fellow human being?"
"She's not a fellow human being, you imbecile," the noble says. "She's a slave. She's a form of existence lower than a worm or even an insect. Do you pause to think about the pain of every bug that you squish between your hands?"

"You can't be serious!" Daren says. "Do you not have eyes? Can you not see that she is the same as us?"

"No, outsider, it is you who cannot see," the noble says. "I know that this is a difficult concept to grasp for a barbarian such as yourself, but I feel that it is my duty as a superior being to educate you."

The noble grabs the slave girl by the hair, and he faces her in Daren's direction.

 "This right here is a slave," the noble says. "That means she is at the very bottom of the hierarchy. In a civilized world, humans are all ranked according to their status. The ones at the bottom serve the purpose of making life easier for the ones at the top. This way, the enlightened minds can focus on ruling, while the lower life forms can focus on the menial tasks that are more suited for them. The existence of slaves is one of the main reasons why our civilization is so much more advanced than that of all the other continents. Who do you think built that giant wall you passed through when you entered the city? Who do you think built the castles, or our complex sewage system? Slaves are the foundation of a healthy and advanced society and your inability to comprehend such a simple concept only proves that you are a product of a far more inferior civilization than that of Varathia."
"You're wrong!" Daren says. "This isn't civilization! This is inhuman! You're treating human lives as if they were nothing! It's not too late. You can still change. If you would just listen to what I'm saying..."

"I see that words are wasted on the likes of you," the noble says, disappointed. "I don't know why I was expecting anything different. If words are too complicated for your understanding, perhaps a visual demonstration is in order."

He puts his hand in his pocket, and he takes out a knife.

"No, wait, what are you doing?" Daren says, as he starts to panic.

 "I am going to show you, outsider, what happens to a slave that can no longer serve her purpose," the noble says. "After I end her miserable life, you will see that nothing is going to change. No one will mourn her passing, no one will stop to look, no one will ever be affected by her death, and life will simply continue to move on without her, as if she'd never existed."
"Wait!" Daren shouts. "I didn't mean to offend you with what I said! Just please, put the knife down, and we can continue our conversation where we left off. Please!"

The slave girl looks as if she has completely given up on any hope that she might have had left. The look in her eyes is completely empty, as she stares at the ground and waits patiently for the inevitable.

"Look at that!" Eiden says, to me. "That oaf is going to get the poor girl killed. Are you okay with this, Barry?"

 I keep quiet, and act as if Eiden hadn't asked me anything.
Eiden smiles, and he addresses Kate next.

"What about you, Kate?" he asks. "The offer I made earlier to Daren still stands. I am willing to give you the power for free, if you just ask for it. Are you sure you want to leave things like this?"

"It's... none of our business," Kate says, with a little hesitation in her voice. "We can't save everyone."

"How pragmatic!" Eiden says, with a smile.

"I'm sure we can reach some sort of an understanding!" Daren says to the noble, starting to get desperate. "I have a lot of money with me. I could buy the girl off you for ten times her price!"

"I already have all the money I need, outsider," the noble says. "It is far more important for me right now to help you see the light. You will thank me for this later."

"Please, if you could just listen--" Daren starts to say, but he doesn't get to finish his sentence.

With one swift movement of his hand, the noble slits the girl's throat wide open, and when he lets go of her hair, her body simply falls on the ground like a lifeless doll, as a pool of blood starts to slowly form beneath her.

"No!" Daren shouts, as he rushes towards the girl's body, and he tries to cast all of the healing spells he knows on her. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no..."

 As he keeps repeating the same word, over and over, Daren's voice starts to tremble, and it doesn't take long for him to break down in tears, while he takes the girl's body in his arms, and he hugs her with all his strength. Rose is looking mortified, as she watches the whole scene unravel before her eyes, while Kate is looking away from them, with a sad expression on her face.
"Leave it to an uneducated oaf from another continent to start crying over some dead slave girl," the noble says. "I thought that in doing this, I might finally make you see reason, but it seems I was mistaken. You truly are a lost cause. I feel sorry for you."

When he hears the noble's words, Daren slowly stops crying, he lets go of the slave, and he looks towards the ground, with a very dark look on his face.

"Eiden," he says. "Give me the power."

"Are you sure this is what you want?" Eiden asks.

"You said you'd give it to me for free as long as I asked," Daren says. "I'm asking for it now. Give me the power."

Eiden smiles widely, as he raises his hands, and a powerful wind starts spinning around him for a few seconds. As the wind stops, Eiden lowers his hands, and he looks towards Daren.

"It is done," he says.

 As soon as he hears Eiden's words, Daren takes his sword out of its sheath, and in less than a second, he swings it with all his might, decapitating the noble on the spot. All of the people who were walking down the street until now have suddenly stopped, and they are now all looking at the noble's corpse falling on the ground, with a terrified look in their eyes.
All of a sudden, the silence is broken by Eiden's laughter. 

"Wonderful!" he says. "Wonderful! Let this image sink into your mind and your heart, healer. Let this mark the beginning of your road to despair. Let it never be forgotten. The day when you chose your worthless pride over the life of an innocent girl."

Daren screams, and he rushes towards Eiden, slashing his sword at him fiercely. Eiden floats into the air, out of his reach, and then he turns to me and Kate.

"One last thing before I go," Eiden says. "I think I should let you know that the spell I cast just now on Daren was an area of effect spell and not a targeted one. This means that it affected the whole area around me, and not just him. The two of you have been given the same gift as your healer friend. If you don't believe me, you can easily verify that I'm telling the truth by looking at any one of the people around you, and trying to imagine hitting them. You will see that the tournament spell no longer poses any resistance. The effect of my spell lasts indefinitely, so this power is yours to use as you please from this day forward. With this said and done, I bid you farewell!"

 Eiden then snaps his fingers, and he immediately disappears without a trace. As I do what he said and try to imagine hitting one of the townsfolk, I realize that he wasn't lying. When I imagined myself hitting the noble before, I definitely felt some sort of force that was trying to stop my very train of thoughts from forming, but none of that happened anymore.
Taking a look towards Daren, I see that he is now calmly sheathing his sword and turning to face us. He has the same dark look in his eyes that he had before.

"We're done here," Daren says, as he walks towards us. "Let's go get Hadrik and Flower so we can all be on our way and leave this place behind us."

"Daren, I..." Rose starts to say, but Daren simply walks past her, without giving her a chance to speak her mind, and he heads towards the armor shop that Hadrik entered earlier.

When Hadrik saw us enter the shop to call for him, he seemed a bit disappointed. It appears that he would have liked to browse the shop's wares a bit more before leaving.

"Why did you all come to get me so early?" Hadrik asks. "Weren't we gonna wait for Flower to come back?"

"Some... stuff happened which made us decide to pick another route towards my home," Rose says. "We'll tell you all the details when we get there. Come on, let's go get Flower."

 "If Daren won't accept the power, then I will," I say.
"I was expecting you to say something like that," Eiden says, with a smile. "Very well, then."

The stillwater then raises his hands, and a powerful wind starts spinning around him for a few seconds. As the wind stops, Eiden lowers his hands, and he looks towards me.

"It is done," he says. 

"Weird," I say. "I don't feel any different."

"Look at the nobleman, and try to imagine yourself hitting him," Eiden says. "You will see that the tournament's spell no longer poses any resistance."

As I do what he says, I realize that he is right. When I imagined myself hitting the noble before, I definitely felt some sort of force that was trying to stop my very train of thoughts from forming, but none of that happened anymore.
 
I waste no time and I run towards the noble, while I ready up my right fist. As soon as I reach him, I punch him hard in the face, which makes him fall on his back. 

 "What is the meaning of this?!" the noble shouts, furious, from the ground. "How DARE you? Do you know who I am?!"
"Sure," I tell him. "You're just another rich jackass who let all his wealth and social status go to his head. Welcome to the real world, buddy!"

"Do you think you can afford to act cocky just because you somehow managed to break through the tournament's protection spell?" the noble says. "You have no idea who you're dealing with here, boy. Being eliminated from the mage tournament will be the least of your worries when I'm done with you."

 Instead of replying to the noble, I calmly take the crossbow out of my backpack, I polish it up a bit, and then I start loading it.
"What's this supposed to be?" the noble says, as he gets up from the ground. "Some sort of threat? You're not going to kill me, boy. You don't have the guts for it. You're just a little troublemaker, that's all you are. Do you want me to tell you what we do to troublemakers in Varathia?"

"Not really," I answer the noble, as I shoot him in the head with a crossbow bolt.

The man dies before he even hits the ground, and as he falls, all of the townsfolk who were walking down the street until now are stopping to look at him, with a terrified look in their eyes. As I put the crossbow in my backpack, I hear a sound of hands slowly clapping behind me.

"Marvelous!" says Eiden. "You have my sincerest congratulations, Barry, on a job well done!"

 He smiles.
"Now then," Eiden says, "if you don't mind me asking, what is your plan for saving the other thousands of slaves in this city?"

"I beg your pardon?" I say.

"Surely, you must have realized that this isn't the only slave in Varathia," Eiden says. "There are thousands more just like this girl, who are living through hell as we speak, and who can't even be sure that they'll make it through the day alive. Are you going to save them too, Barry?"

Eiden smiles widely.

"The slave girl?!" the noble says. "You've just forfeited your life and that of your friends for the sake of a worthless slave? I'm going to give her to you if that's what you want, outsider. But I hope you're not stupid enough to think that I'm going to hand her over in one piece."

The noble takes a knife out of his pocket, and he tries to stab the girl with it, but before he gets to reach her, I grab his arm with both hands, and I twist it until he drops his weapon on the ground, while screaming in pain.

"You're going to pay for this, outsider!" the noble says, as he jumps back from me. "You all will! Including you, herbalist girl!"

Rose is looking a bit scared, as the noble points his finger towards her.

"That's right!" he says. "I remember who you are! I know where you live! Say goodbye to the peaceful life you've been leading until now. It's only going to be hell for you after I-- AAAARRRGH!"

Before he gets to finish his threat, the noble gets engulfed in flames, and within a matter of seconds, he turns into ashes, while the fire dies out almost as quickly as it appeared. The townsfolk who were walking down the street until now are all stopping to look at the pile of ashes gathering on the ground, with a terrified look in their eyes.

 ”See, Barry, this is how you get the job done right," Eiden says. "You wouldn't want to cause your lovely host more trouble than you already have, would you?"
"I suppose not..." I say.

Eiden smiles.

I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I will find a way, and when I'm done, I'm going to come back to you and shove it in your face. Is this a good enough answer to your question?"
As I was talking, I noticed that Eiden opened his eyes for the first time since I've met him. At first, it appeared to be because of the shock, but then his look slowly turned into one of sorrow and regret, while I continued to speak. When I finished my monologue, Eiden closed back his eyes, and he smiled.

"It is indeed," he answers me. "I will be looking forward to seeing you put your words into action. But for now, I believe my job here is done, so I will take my leave."

Eiden raises himself in the air and he prepares to teleport out of the city.

"Oh, there's one last thing I should tell you before I go," the stillwater says, as he turns to Daren and Kate. "The spell I cast just now on Barry was an area of effect spell and not a targeted one.

 Eiden then snaps his fingers, and he immediately disappears without a trace.

As I turn around, the girl takes a bow, and then she introduces herself.

"My name is Ella," she says, "but most of my masters simply called me 'slave girl'. I know I may not look like much, but if you will have me, I vow to serve you to the best of my ability, until the day I die. Just give me my first order, and our contract will be complete."

After I finish my sentence, I feel a sudden pain coming from my head, as Kate pulls me by the hair from behind.

"You and your stupid jokes!" Kate says. "Couldn't you have reigned yourself in for at least one more minute?"

"Master?" the girl asks me, confused.

"Ella, you don't need to do anything for me," I say, as Kate releases me. "You can just go wherever you want and do whatever you like from now on!"

"I'm sorry, I don't understand..." Ella says.

"Barry just wanted to say that you're free to come with us!" Rose says, with a smile, as she puts her hand on the girl's shoulder. "We're currently heading towards my house, which is not far from here."

 "Y-y-yes sir," Ella says. "Of course."
"But for now, I think you should start by getting rid of those bruises," Rose says. "That tall man over there dressed in armor just so happens to be our group's healer.  He'll fix you up in a jiffy! Isn't that right, Daren?"

Daren seemed to be deeply buried in his own thoughts when Rose called out to him. It took him a while before he came to his senses and realized what she wanted from him.

"Yeah..." he says. "Sure. Come over here, and we'll have a look."

As Ella goes to get healed, Rose pulls me and Kate aside to have a little private conversation with us.

"Barry, you can't just save the girl like that and then tell her that she can do whatever she wants," Rose whispers to me. "That's almost as cruel as it would have been to do nothing and leave her to her fate."

"What do you mean?" I ask her.

Rose sighs.

"Even if the girl understands your true intentions, what would you expect her to do once she's free?" Rose asks. "She has no home to go to, no family, no friends, no possessions, and to make matters worse, everyone knows that she's been a slave until recently. Even if she would somehow manage to find a place to work somewhere, no one would bat an eye if someone were to kidnap her and make her into a slave again. At most, you'd be giving her a small taste of freedom, which would be ripped away from her a few days afterwards."

 "If you're telling us all of this, then I suppose you have an idea of what we can do with her?" I say.
"I do!" Rose says, smiling. "I'm going to hire her as a maid at my house! I've always been a bit worried about leaving my two siblings alone whenever I went away for a long while, so I usually asked my ex-husband to check up on them every now and then, but if I had a maid to take care of things, I would be much more relieved!"

"Yeah, but won't she understand once I've explained it to her more clearly?" I say.

Rose sighs.

"Even if the girl understands your true intentions, what would you expect her to do once she's free?" Rose asks.

At most, you'd be giving her a small taste of freedom, which would be ripped away from her a few days afterwards."

 "If you're telling us all of this, then I suppose you have an idea of what we can do with her?" I say.
"I do!" Rose says, smiling. "I'm going to hire her as a maid at my house! I've always been a bit worried about leaving my two siblings alone whenever I went away for a long while, so I usually asked my ex-husband to check up on them every now and then, but if I had a maid to take care of things, I would be much more relieved!"

"Aren't you worried about leaving your little brother and sister home alone with a person you barely know?" Kate asks.

 "Taking into account the harsh training that slaves get these days, I very much doubt that Ella would ever do anything to harm the children," Rose says. "It will also be a while until I leave again on such a long journey away from home, so I'll have plenty of time to get to know her and to learn what kind of a person she is."
Rose pauses.

"Besides," she says, "Daren and Eiden both made me realize that I haven't been completely honest with myself until now regarding the way slaves get treated in our society. What Eiden said was completely true. I really have been turning a blind eye to this whole situation because it was more convenient that way. I have no excuse. Even if I can't change the way our society works, I can still try to help where I can. Seeing Barry tackle the problem so directly in front of my eyes gave me the courage to finally start doing something about it myself! And for now, the way I can help is to provide a home and a sense of purpose to this poor unfortunate girl."

"Okay, you're all patched up now!" Daren tells Ella.

"Thank you, sir," the girl says.

 Now that her bruises are gone, and I get a good look at her face, I suddenly realize that Ella could very well give Rose a run for her money in a beauty contest. Even though her messy black hair and the tattered rags she's wearing aren't doing her any favors, her face has all the features that make a girl look beautiful without any makeup. She has a small nose, high cheekbones, full lips and large brown eyes, while her body's proportions seem almost perfectly balanced. If she'd lived a normal life, and she had attended a school like all other girls her age, she would have likely been very popular. Girls would have killed to have her in their groups, and boys would have courted her every single day. She would have had a life that most girls her age could only dream of. If she'd lived a normal life...
"Alright, then!" Rose says, as she takes a sideways glance towards all the people who were standing on the side of the street, staring at us. "We shouldn't linger here any longer. Let's go get Hadrik and Flower, and we'll take another route towards my house."

When Hadrik saw us enter the shop to call for him, he seemed a bit disappointed. It appears that he would have liked to browse the shop's wares a bit more before leaving.

"Why did you all come to get me so early?" Hadrik asks. "Weren't we gonna wait for Flower to come back?"

"Some... stuff happened which made us decide to pick another route towards my home," Rose says. "We'll tell you all the details when we get there." 

 "Uh-huh," Hadrik says. "And I'm guessing those details will also cover how you all recruited a new team member in my absence?"
"You catch on fast!" Rose says, with a playful smile.

"Name's Hadrik," Hadrik says, as he approaches Ella, "but most friends call me 'the dwarf'. Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

The dwarf extends his hand towards the girl, but she gets scared, and she instinctively jumps back when he gets near her. Ella then looks at both me and Rose, seemingly asking for our approval, and when I nod to her, she hesitantly grabs Hadrik's hand and she shakes it weakly. 

"You've never really met a dwarf before, have you lass?" Hadrik asks Ella, with a grin.

"It's a bit more complicated than that," Rose says. "Like I said, we'll go over the details when we arrive at my house. Come on, let's go get Flower."

 We found Flower a few minutes later, on one of the streets we'd taken when we first came into the city. She'd already finished replacing the chain on Arraka's amulet, and she was also surprised that we didn't wait for her at our designated meeting spot, but she agreed to postpone her questions until after we'd reached Rose's house. 
We took a somewhat roundabout way this time around, in order to make sure that nobody who saw the earlier scene was following us. As we advanced into the city, the scenery began to slowly change, and instead of broken down shacks, we started seeing more elegant houses, and even a few mansions. The putrid smell on the streets was also long gone by the time we'd finally reached Rose's house. To our surprise, despite her previous claims of living in relative poverty, Rose's house was in fact a very large mansion, with two floors and a yard the size of a small park. 

"Kate, you can stop suppressing your magical aura now," Rose says, as we walk across her yard. "My siblings don't know what a banshee is, so there's no need to hide from them!"

 "Rose, I don't mean to sound rude," Hadrik says, "but didn't you tell me that you and your two siblings were living a modest life here in the city?" 
Rose blushes.

"I am not the one who bought this house," Rose says. "This is where I used to live with my old husband, before we got divorced. He told me that he didn't mind me keeping this house for myself, since he owned many other mansions in better areas of the city. I meant to refuse him at first, but I had both my siblings and my sickly father to care for at the time and it would have been very hard for me to continue living with them in our old cramped house."

"Ah, he was trying to win you back with a little parting gift, was he?" Hadrik asks, with a grin.

 "Actually, no," Rose says. "The main reason why we broke up is that Enrique was never really the kind of man who would be happy being tied down to only one woman. After we got divorced, he told me that during our marriage, he felt like a caged bird that was denied the freedom to soar the skies, in search of stars that shined brightly in the night. He also told me that no matter how many stars he'd end up visiting, I would always remain the sun that outshines them all, and that he'd never love another woman with as much passion as he'd loved me."
Rose giggles.

"It was always hard to take him seriously when he said things like that," she says, smiling.

"Look, it's Rose!" I hear a young girl shout from a distance, as she comes running towards us. "Rose is back! Come quick!"

The girl, who appears to be Rose's eight year old sister, is now waving towards her nine year old brother, and they both race across the yard, until they finally reach us.

 "Rose, look!" the girl says, with a proud tone in her voice, as she takes something out of her pocket and shows it to her. "Billy's already fourteen years old! And he's just as lively as ever! See?"
"That's really good news, Suzie!" Rose says, smiling, as she pats her sister on her head. "I'll admit that I was a bit worried about him while I was gone, but I see now that I had no reason to doubt you!"

I notice that the virtual pet toy that Suzie is holding in her hand looks incredibly similar to my stat device. Even more so than I remembered. Could it also be some ancient device made by the lessathi which holds hidden powers like the 'fortune teller's trinket' that I have in my pocket?

 "Uh, Suzie," I say, "can I borrow that toy of yours for a second? I just want to look at something."
"No!" the girl says. "It's mine! You can't have it!"

Honestly, I don't know what else I was expecting when I asked that question.

"Alright, then how about a trade?" I say, as I take out my stat booster out of my pocket. "I'll let you play around with this while I take a look at your toy. Deal?"

The girl tries to feign indifference when she sees my stat device, but it's easy enough to see that I've piqued her interest. Eventually, she gives in and agrees to temporarily trade her device for my own. As I study her toy closely, I notice that there is a small marking on the side which looks much like a bended fork, but aside from that, there is nothing else that stands out. I didn't even feel that faint tingling sensation that I usually get when my stat device tries to attach itself to my aura. Maybe it is only a toy after all.

"You sure it's a good idea to just hand your device over to her like that, Barry?" Hadrik asks me, grinning. "Aren't you worried that she'll completely mess all of your stats while she plays with it?"

"Nah," I say. "I made sure to lock all the stats before I gave it to her. The only thing she can do with it right now is look at the screen."

Once I'm done looking at the toy, I give it back to Rose's sister, in exchange for my stat device.

 "You tricked me!" Suzie says, with a pouty face. "Your toy is broken. It doesn't do anything. That's not fair!"
"Life is never fair, kid," I tell her, as I put my device back in my pocket. "It's better to learn that while you're young!"

"Don't you listen to him, Suzie!" Rose says. "Barry is just grumpy because his parents would only give him broken toys when he was a kid."

Suzie giggles.

"Poor Barry!" she says.

"Poor Barry!" her brother mimics her. 

"Rose," Daren says. "Could you show me to my room? All I want right now is to lie down in a bed for a while."

"Certainly!" Rose says. "Follow me, I'll show you the way!"

"We'll come too, we'll come too!" Rose's siblings say, in unison.

"Okay, okay, you'll come too!" Rose says, smiling.

She then turns to us.

"Please, make yourselves comfortable!" Rose says. "You can come inside the house and wait in the main hall if you like."

"Nah, we're good for now, thanks!" Hadrik says. "We'll just sit at one of these picnic tables."

"I'll be right back!" Rose says, and then she goes with Daren and her siblings inside the mansion.

 I decide to leave the girl alone. The stat device's resemblance to the toy is probably only a coincidence. 
"That shield looks so cool!" Rose's little brother says, when he sees Daren. "I have a toy soldier with a shield just like that! Can I touch it? Can I touch it?"

"Some other time, kid," Daren says. 

He then turns to Rose.

"Rose," Daren says. "Could you show me to my room? All I want right now is to lie down in a bed for a while."

 "Okay, now that we're finally here," Hadrik says, as we all seat ourselves at one of the many garden tables in Rose's yard, "will someone please tell me what happened to Daren that made him turn into even more of a stick-in-the-mud than usual?"
Kate and I exchange a look, and then we start giving Hadrik and Flower a full recounting of the events they missed while they were shopping.

"Damn it!" Hadrik says, after hearing our whole story. "If only I hadn't gone into that stupid shop. If I'd been there with you, I would have asked Eiden for the power in Daren's place and I would have saved that poor girl's life."

He pauses.

"Hadrik," Kate says. "We can't save everyone..."

"That doesn't mean that we have to ignore what happens right in front of our faces!" Hadrik says, as he slams both his fists on the table in front of him. "I can't believe you two! I barely feel like I know you anymore! It's like you've both turned into Arraka!"

"And what's so bad about that?" Arraka asks, as Hadrik grabs his backpack, gets up from the table and storms through the yard, all the way to the mansion's entrance.

"Can you believe this guy?" Arraka asks us. "One moment he's all about fighting and drinking, and then all of a sudden he starts acting like the healer! What's the big deal about some slave girl dying anyway?"

"Shut up, Arraka," Flower says.

"What?" Arraka says. "That girl was totally asking for it. She was trying to slack off on the job, and on top of that she even gave her owner lip when he told her to get back to work. I would have killed her too if she were my slave and she acted with me like that. Hell, I would have probably killed her anyway just for laughs!"

"Arraka, do you want to spend the next twenty years with your amulet closed again?" Flower says. 

 This time, the girl managed to shut her up. It doesn't seem like Arraka is very keen on returning to her old way of life anytime soon.
"Did... something happen to Hadrik?" Rose says, as she approaches us. "He asked me to give him the directions to his room when we met in the hallway, and after I gave them to him, he just stormed right past me, without saying another word. He looked pretty upset about something."
 
"He got really angry when we told him what happened to the slave girl earlier," Kate says.

"Oh..." Rose says. "I see..."

"Could you lead us to our rooms too?" I say, trying to change the subject. "I could really go for a nap in an actual bed right now."

"Of course," Rose says. "Follow me."

After showing us all to our rooms, Rose told us that she now needed to go visit the Sparrow's district, in order to bring all of her collected herbs to the sick. She said she'd most likely come back by sundown, and that she'd leave the house in our care until then. Since none of us were really in the mood for hanging out after all that's happened, we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon in our rooms, until Rose came back.

Once she returned, we all got together at one of the picnic tables in the yard, and Hadrik joined us too, after he cooled down a bit. Daren, however, hasn't gotten out of his room at all since we arrived at the mansion.

 "Sorry about earlier," Hadrik tells me and Kate, as we sit at the garden table. "I overreacted. I wasn't there when everything happened, so I had no right to complain. I'm sure that you both did what you thought was best, given the situation at hand."
"There's no need to apologize," Kate says. "We were all affected by the slave's death in some way. I don't blame you for getting so upset."

As we all sat at the table and talked, Rose's siblings also occasionally joined us, when they were taking a break from running around the yard.

"Hey, you," Rose's little brother says, as he looks towards Flower. "Why are you dressed like a clown?"

"I'm not dressed like a clown!" Flower says, visibly upset. "Are you stupid? These clothes are the same as what I used to wear when I worked as a trapeze artist and as an acrobat back at the circus!"

"Trapeze artists, acrobats, clowns - same thing," the boy says.

Flower looks as if she's about to explode.

 "Don't mind him," Suzie tells Flower. "Kevin just likes to act like a jerk sometimes. Your clothes are fine. And your hair is very pretty."
"Uh, thanks, I guess?" Flower says, confused.

"I wish I had beautiful long red hair like yours," Suzie says. "Could you let me braid your hair for you? Pretty please?"

"No!" Flower says, shocked, and she grabs her hair in her hands, as if she were protecting it from a dangerous predator.

"Okay," Suzie says, with a sad look on her face.

As it got close to bedtime, we each started heading towards our own rooms and said we'd meet up again in the morning, to plan what we wanted to do next. Before going to bed, I took a nice long bath in one of the many bathrooms available in the mansion.

"Wait, you're still sleeping?" Daren says. "Wake up and get dressed, will you? We're all waiting for you downstairs. Hurry up or we'll leave you behind. I'm serious." 

As Daren leaves, I take a look outside my window, and I see that the sun had only just risen about an hour ago. Everyone was already waiting outside, while Rose's siblings were running around the yard, as lively as ever. 

I jump out of bed and get dressed, but I don't take my backpack with me. Daren probably only meant that we were going downtown to get some supplies. I take some money with me, and my dagger, just in case, and then I head downstairs. 

"Where are we going?" I ask Rose, as I approach everyone who was waiting in the yard.

 "We're going to a hospital from the Beggar's district," Rose says. "I went there yesterday, after visiting the Sparrow's district, and I saw a lot of wounded who weren't being treated properly due to a severe lack of qualified personnel. None of them seemed to be in critical condition, but Daren's healing spells would be a godsend to those people. At first, I only wanted to bring Daren, but Hadrik insisted that we all go."
"It's safer if we all stick together," Hadrik says. "Just because we're in a city, it doesn't mean that we can let our guards down. We're still in the middle of a deadly tournament, after all."

"Okay, if everyone's ready, we should get going," Rose says. "We'll be taking the shorter route this time, so be sure to stay close to me so you don't get lost."

"Great!" Hadrik says. "Just great! Why did I have to enter that armor shop? They didn't even have anything worth buying!"

"Excuse me, master," says Ella, who is seated right next to me. "I don't... mean to interrupt, but you haven't given me any task to perform since we arrived here."

"Oh, it's fine," I tell her. "Don't worry about it. You can just sit there and rest for now."

"Y-y-yes sir..." the girl says.

Instead of calming her down, my words seem to have only made her even more restless. She is now fidgeting nervously and sweating all over as she stares intently at the table in front of her.

 "There you are!" Rose says, as she approaches us and then seats herself next to Flower. "Daren's already unpacked his bags. Would you like me to show you to your rooms?"

 Ella suddenly jumps to her feet, with a very scared look on her face.
"There's no need to give me the test!" the girl says. "I promise I will work my hardest! I won't disappoint you! I promise!"

Her sudden outburst had temporarily rendered us speechless, as we all paused to look at each other for a few seconds.

"Ella, nobody is testing anyone," Rose says. "Please, sit down, you must be really tired..."

"Yes, sir..." Ella says, with a high pitched tone, almost as if she were about to cry, and she sits herself down again.

"Rose, what is she talking about?" I say. "What kind of test is she referring to?"

"I... don't know..." Rose says. "I've never heard of anything like this before."

"She's talking about the test of loyalty," Kate says, all of a sudden. "It's a test used to make sure that prisoners don't try to run away from their captors. They used it quite a bit at the Beacon."

"I don't get it," Hadrik says. "Why does the girl think that we're testing her? We never implied that we were doing anything of the sort."

 "Because you're all being too nice," Kate says. "And that's always how a test of loyalty begins. At the Beacon, every now and then, a member of the staff or a complete stranger would start acting very nice and considerate with one of the orphans, out of the blue. After some time, when they were sure that they'd gained their trust, they'd suddenly say that they wanted to help them escape. If the orphan believed them, and followed their instructions, they would be recaptured by the very person that tried to help them, and told that it was all a test of loyalty that they had failed. Then they would either be beaten senseless for breaking the rules, or they'd be killed to serve as an example for all the other orphans. This way, if anyone ever actually tried to help one of us, we'd never believe them, and we'd choose to remain prisoners, out of fear."
Rose gasps.

"My gods, that's horrible," she says. "But if what you say is true, then how are we going to convince Ella that we're telling the truth?"

"We're not going to convince her," Kate says. "Even after hearing us discuss things openly in front of her like this, she still probably thinks it's all just part of an elaborate act, in order to make her lower her guard. She must think that once she agrees to rest, she'll have failed the test, and we'll deem her worthless, just like that noble."

 "Is there anything we can do to make Ella less suspicious of us?" I ask Kate.
"Yes," Kate says. "First of all, you're going to have to stop trying to pamper her. It's only making things worse."

"Alright," Rose says, with a determined look on her face, as she turns to the girl. "Ella, you're going to march into that house, and bring me a glass of water. The kitchen is visible from the main hall. It's equipped with a sink with running water, and there are some glasses on one of the upper shelves. Did you get all that?"

"Yes, sir," the girl says, as she gets up in a hurry. "I'll bring it to you at once!"

As the girl runs towards the house, Rose lets out a big sigh, as if what she'd just done had cost her a great deal of energy.

"I hope I wasn't too harsh on the poor girl," Rose says, with a concerned look on her face.

"We're going to have to think of a way to make Ella get more accustomed to her current situation," Kate says. "Ordering her around like this can only serve as a temporary solution."

As we all sit there and think, Ella comes out of the house, with a glass of water in her hand, and with both of Rose's siblings running around her in circles as she walks.

 "I think I might just have an idea!" Rose says, with a smile, as she looks at the three of them.
"You're very pretty!" Suzie tells Ella, as she approaches us.

"Uh... Thank you, miss-- sir," Ella says, looking a little confused.

Suzie giggles.

"I like you," she says. "You're funny!" 

"I think I have the perfect job for you, Ella!" Rose says, after Ella brings her the glass of water.

"W-w-what would you have me do, sir?" Ella asks.

"I want you to follow my little sister Suzie around wherever she goes, and I want you to listen to her every order for the remainder of the day!" Rose says, with an evil smile.

"Of course..." Ella says. "I will not let you down."

 "Fine," I say. "Ella, go and trim those bushes over there. That's an order!"
"Yes, sir," the girl says, as she gets up in a hurry and goes to search for some trimming shears.

"Damn it, Barry!" Hadrik says. "We're trying to help her, not stress her out even more!"

"No, this is good," Kate says. "Having something to do will at least ease her mind for the time being. In the meantime, we're going to have to think of a way to make her get more accustomed to her current situation."

As Ella starts to trim one of the bushes, Rose's siblings both come running out of the mansion, and they stop right next to her, apparently trying to start a conversation.

 "I think I might just have an idea!" Rose says, with a smile, as she looks at the three of them.
"You're very pretty!" Suzie tells Ella.

"Uh... Thank you, miss-- sir," Ella says, looking a little confused.

 Suzie gasps.
"She'll do anything I say?" she asks.

"Anything you say!" Rose says, with a smile.

Suzie squeals happily when she hears Rose's answer.

"Ella, follow me," she says. "I know exactly what we're going to do next!"

"Yes, miss-- sir..." Ella says, as she follows the little girl into the mansion.

"You sure that was a good idea?" Hadrik asks.

"I'm positive!" Rose says. "Now come on, I'll show you each to your rooms, so you can unpack."

After we each settled down in our own rooms, we went to meet outside with Rose, who needed to go visit the Sparrow's district, in order to bring all of her collected herbs to the sick. She said she'd most likely come back by sundown, and that she'd leave the house in our care until then. As we all wave goodbye to Rose, Suzie suddenly comes out the front door, pulling Ella by the hand, while rushing towards us.

 If I did not know that Ella left with Suzie a little while ago, it would have taken me a minute to figure out whose hand the little girl was holding. The former slave girl was nearly unrecognizable, as she was now wearing an elegant green dress, while her hair had been cleaned up, and meticulously braided. She looked stunning. I guess this explains what the two of them have been doing for the past two hours.
"Ta-daaaa!" Suzie says, with a very proud look on her face.

"Wow," Hadrik says. "That's uh... quite the change. Are you the one who braided her hair, Suzie?"

"Yep!" the little girl says, beaming. "Isn't she beautiful? Come on, Ella, don't be shy, and turn around so everyone can see!"

Ella seems to be very flustered about all of this, and her cheeks could not be any more red. She probably isn't used to getting this much attention. She turns around, just as ordered, so we could all have a look at her braided hair. Looking at it closely, you could clearly see that there's been a lot of work put into it. The girl must have been at it for at least the better part of an hour.

"Come on, Ella!" Suzie says, as she grabs her hand, and she pulls her back towards the mansion. "Let's play!"

 Hadrik, Kate, Flower and I spent the rest of the day at one of the picnic tables, chatting and eating some more of Flower's magically conceived delicacies. Daren did not come out of the mansion at all during the day, so he must have spent most of the time in his room. As we all sat down at the table, every once in a while, we'd catch a glimpse of Suzie and Ella, running around the yard, or playing hide and seek. As the sun was starting to set, it was becoming clear that Ella was making a great effort to keep up with the little girl's demands, as she got more and more tired.
"Faster!" Suzie says, as Ella runs around the yard, giving her a piggyback ride. "You can do it, Ella! Faster!"

"Hey, Suzie," Rose's little brother says, as he watches Ella run circles around the yard. "Ella will do anything you say, right?"

"Yep!" the girl says.

"Tell her to stand on her hands!" the boy says.

"What?" Suzie ask, shocked. "No! Why would I tell her to do that?"

"Because it'd be fun to watch!" the boy says.

"I won't tell her to stand on her hands, Kevin!"

"Why not? She'll do everything you tell her to do, so where's the problem?"

"That doesn't mean we have to make fun of her!" Suzie says, visibly upset.

 "Pffft!" Kevin says. "You're no fun."
"No, you're no fun!" Suzie says. "You're just a mean meanie head, and that's why you don't have any friends!"

Suzie gets down from Ella's back and she hugs her tightly, while giving her brother a menacing look.

"Don't worry, Ella," the little girl says. "I would never do anything to hurt you!"

Ella now looks like she's barely able to stand on her feet.

"Thank you... miss..." she says, with the last of her strength, and then she faints, due to exhaustion.

"Ella!" Suzie screams.

When we see what happened, Hadrik and I both rush simultaneously towards Ella, and the first thing we do is to make sure that she is still alive. The girl is still breathing, but she has a very high fever. 

"I did this!" Suzie says, as tears start streaming down her face. "I killed her! I shouldn't have asked her for that piggyback ride! I should have seen that she was too tired! Now she's going to die and it's all my fault!"

After she finishes her last sentence, the girl breaks down into uncontrollable crying, and she buries her head in her arms.

 "Suzie, listen to me," I tell the girl, as I put my hands on her shoulders. "Ella was going to work herself to exhaustion whether you ordered her to or not. It's not your fault."
"I'll go get Daren," Kate says, as she heads towards the mansion.

"You don't know that!" Suzie tells me. "You can't know that!"

"Yes, I can," I tell the girl. "We tried to get Ella to rest but she wouldn't listen to us. Rose only entrusted her to you because she knew that you wouldn't overwork her any more than she'd already overwork herself. She's not going to die. She's only exhausted, that's all. She'll recover after a good night's sleep."

"Barry, come on," Hadrik says. "We need to get her to a bed somewhere. Do you know if there are any empty rooms still left in the mansion?"

"Yeah, there's one at the end of the long hallway on the right," I say. "I'll show you the way. Come on, Suzie, you're coming too!"

We manage to get Ella lying on a bed, and soon afterwards, Kate and Daren also come rushing into the room.

"Why didn't anyone tell her to get some rest?" Daren says, as he casts a healing spell on the girl. "She was already exhausted enough when we first met her."

"We tried to," Kate says, "but she wouldn't listen. She was too afraid that if she showed any weakness, we'd discard her without thinking, like that noble."

 "That lowlife bastard," Daren says, as he clenches his fist. "I'd kill him if he weren't already dead."
After Daren finished his spell, we could see that the girl's breathing was starting to become more relaxed.

"I took care of the fever," Daren says, "but the fatigue is still there. She'll need to rest for a while in order to fully recover."

"Oh gods, what happened here?" Rose says, as she enters the house, and she sees us all standing around Ella's bed.

"The girl overworked herself, and she fainted from exhaustion," Hadrik says.

"I figured that might happen..." Rose says. "Is she going to be okay?"

"She's fine," Daren says. "She's just tired. But she won't be able to work anymore for the rest of the day."

"I can still... work..." Ella says, as she wakes up from hearing Daren's words, and she tries to get out of bed, only to fall on her back soon afterwards.

"Ella, you're alive!" Suzie says, and she hugs her with all her might. "You're alive!"

"Master, I can still work," Ella says, with a desperate look in her eyes, as she tries to get out of bed again but fails. "Please, just give me another order."

 "I'll go get Daren," I say. "You guys find her an empty room and get her lying on a bed."
Hadrik nods to me, and I go rushing through the mansion's door and up the stairs, all the way to Daren's room.

"Daren!" I shout as I knock as hard as I can on his room's door. "Daren, are you in there?"

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks as he opens the door. "Are we being attacked?"

"No, but Ella just fainted from exhaustion and she has a really high fever," I tell him. "We need your help!"

"Lead the way," Daren says, as he gets a serious look on his face.

I take the stairs down, and I head towards the empty room that's closest to the mansion's entrance, since that was probably where everyone else was headed. Sure enough, when we get there, we see that everyone was already waiting for us, and that Ella was lying on a bed, still unconscious. 

"Why didn't anyone tell her to get some rest?" Daren says, as he casts a healing spell on the girl. "She was already exhausted enough when we first met her."

"We tried to," Kate says, "but she wouldn't listen. She was too afraid that if she showed any weakness, we'd discard her without thinking, like that noble."

 "No," Rose says, as she frowns at her. "You can't work anymore today. You can't even get out of bed. That means that as a slave, you are completely worthless to me now. And the only fate that awaits a worthless slave is death."
Ella looks at Rose with fear in her eyes, but she no longer has the strength to fight back. Rose grabs the girl's hand between her palms, she looks her in the eyes, and she gives her a warm smile.

"But you are not a slave anymore," Rose says. "You have no longer been a slave ever since Barry saved you from that noble, today. I did not bring you here to work for me as a slave. I brought you here to work as a maid. If I truly considered you to be my slave, then nothing should have stopped me from ending your life when you became a burden to me. You of all people should know this better than anyone."

The fear in Ella's eyes is slowly starting to leave her, and it looks as if she's finally beginning to understand what Rose really means.

"You are free, Ella," Rose continues. "You are no longer bound by anyone, or anything. You can go wherever you want, and do whatever you want for as long as you want. You don't have to listen to anyone's orders ever again, and you can make your own choices without living in fear."

Rose pauses.

 "But if you'll allow me to make a selfish request..." Rose says. "I would be very grateful if you chose to remain here. I don't have a lot of money to give you, and the kids will probably drive you mad half of the time, but Suzie has already gotten very attached to you, and I think she'd really miss you if you were gone. I can't promise you that you'll have a good life here, but I can promise that we'll try our hardest to make you feel at home. Ella, would it be too much to ask of you to keep working for us for a while longer?"
"No!" Ella says, as she looks like she's about to cry. "Of course not! I would love to keep working here! My time spent here has been the happiest of my life! I don't want to leave! I promise that I'll work hard, and that I'll never betray your trust!"

"Then our contract is complete!" Rose says, as she smiles, and she shakes the girl's hand. "You can start working chores as soon as you're fully recovered, but if you're really keen on not slacking off today, you can still play with Suzie. I'm pretty sure that she's not planning to leave your bedside anytime soon!"

Now that Rose had finally managed to put Ella's worries to rest, we decided to leave her alone with Suzie, so that she could take her mind off her work for a few hours. Since it was getting close to bedtime, we each started heading towards our own rooms and said we'd meet up again in the morning, to plan what we wanted to do next. 

 Before going to bed, I took a nice long bath in one of the many bathrooms available in the mansion. It was nice to bathe in hot water, for a change, after all of those days of washing in cold lakes and rivers. As I entered my room, my stat device started beeping loudly. It's been a while since I've gotten any new points to spend on my stats. I need to be extra careful with what I choose to upgrade this time, because at this rate, who knows when I'll be getting my next batch of points.
I take the device out of my pocket and start thinking how to make the best use of these points.

"It's a good thing that you didn't go to sleep yet," she says, as she walks into my room, carrying a tray full of muffins. "I know that these muffins will not compare to anything that Flower can cook up, but I really wanted to show you my appreciation for what you did today somehow!"

She places the tray on a small table near my bed, and she seats herself on the bed beside me.

"These are really good," I tell her, after I take a bite, "but there was no need to go out of your way to make them just for me! I don't remember doing anything special.

She then gets up from the bed and takes a bite out of one of the muffins.

"Wow, these really are good!" she says. "I should make them more often. You won't mind if I take two of these with me, will you? Suzie has always outdone me when it comes to muffins, and I'd like to brag about this a little!"

"Of course not," I say. "They were yours to begin with!"

Rose smiles again, and she takes two muffins off the tray, before she starts leaving the room. She stops by the door, and she turns to face me one more time.

"Thank you again, Barry," Rose says. "For everything you've done. You have no idea how much this all means to me. I hope I'll be able to fully repay you some day."

She pauses.

"Good night, Barry!" she says, after a few seconds.

"Good night, Rose!" I say, as she turns around and leaves the room.

After she left, I ate a few more muffins, and then I went to sleep. I woke up several hours later, to the sound of Daren's voice.

 "Barry, wake up!" he says. "You're not planning on sleeping in again, are you? Come on, get up, or we'll leave you behind!"
As Daren leaves, I take a look outside my window, and I see that the sun had only just risen about an hour ago. Everyone was already waiting outside, while Rose's siblings were running around the yard, as lively as ever. 

I jump out of bed and get dressed, but I don't take my backpack with me. Daren probably only meant that we were going downtown to get some supplies. I take some money with me, and my dagger, just in case, and then I head downstairs. 

"About time," Daren says, as I approach everyone who was waiting in the yard. "What took you so long?"

"Where are we going?" I ask Rose, as I completely ignore Daren's question.

"We're going to a hospital from the Beggar's district," Rose says. "I went there yesterday, after visiting the Sparrow's district, and I saw a lot of wounded who weren't being treated properly due to a severe lack of qualified personnel. None of them seemed to be in critical condition, but Daren's healing spells would be a godsend to those people. At first, I only wanted to bring Daren, but Hadrik insisted that we all go."

 "It's safer if we all stick together," Hadrik says. "Just because we're in a city, it doesn't mean that we can let our guards down. We're still in the middle of a deadly tournament, after all."
"Okay, if everyone's ready, we should get going," Rose says. "We'll be taking the shorter route this time, so be sure to stay close to me so you don't get lost."

#if(v_ch11_romance_rose == 1) {
 "Of course! I always feel that way when I talk to you."
Rose's cheeks have now turned even redder than before.

She doesn't say a word for a few seconds, and then she suddenly gets a very determined look on her face.

"Alright, then!" Rose says, as she gets up from the bed, goes to close and lock the bedroom's door and then comes back to place herself right in front of me.

"What are you--" I start to say, but I don't get to finish, as Rose bends over and kisses my lips softly.

She then gets on top of me and slowly pushes me onto the bed, as her lips remain pressed against mine.

"Wait, wait, wait," I say. "We're doing this now?"

"Why not?" Rose asks me, with a playful smile. "Would you rather we do this in some ruins, while fighting a bunch of ogres?" 

"Well, no, but... I mean, we're still kind of in the middle of a deadly mage tournament," I say.

"We're not getting married, Barry," Rose says, smiling. "It's just one night. As long as I drink my tea of infertility in the morning, we may as well part ways tomorrow, and nothing will have changed."

 "Yes, but--"
Rose puts her index finger on my lips in order to silence me.

"I will not hear another word from you," she says. "This is my thanks to you for everything you've done for me since we first met. We are doing this, and that's final!"

She smiles.

"You don't need to worry about anything, Barry," she says. "Just close your eyes, and let me take care of everything. I promise you that neither of us is going to regret this!"

She then presses her lips against mine once more, as she starts to slowly unbutton my shirt. The next two hours seemed like they were almost a dream. Was I really still in the same place where I've been desperately fighting for my life for almost a week? The same place where I spent my time fighting dragons, dodging traps and stealing treasure from ogres? Actually, now that I pause to think about it, last week is starting to sound a lot more like a dream than what happened tonight. Maybe it really was a dream. I mean, seriously... Dragons? Who in their right mind would ever believe a story like that?

 With these final thoughts, I put my head on the pillow, I hug Rose tightly in my arms, and I close my eyes. I wake up several hours later, to the sound of Daren's voice.
"Barry, wake up!" he says. "You're not planning on sleeping in again, are you? Come on, get up, or we'll leave you behind!"

As Daren leaves, I take a look outside my window, and I see that the sun had only just risen about an hour ago. Everyone was already waiting outside, while Rose's siblings were running around the yard, as lively as ever. I guess it wasn't a dream after all.

 "No, that was just a spur of the moment thing. Don't worry about it!"
Rose smiles.

"If you say that I shouldn't worry about it, then I won't!" she says.

She then gets up from the bed and takes a bite out of one of the muffins.

"Wow, these really are good!" she says. "I should make them more often. You won't mind if I take two of these with me, will you? Suzie has always outdone me when it comes to muffins, and I'd like to brag about this a little!"

"Of course not," I say. "They were yours to begin with!"

Rose smiles again, and she takes two muffins off the tray, before she starts leaving the room. She stops by the door, and she turns to face me one more time.

"Thank you again, Barry," Rose says. "For everything you've done. You have no idea how much this all means to me. I hope I'll be able to fully repay you some day."

She pauses.

"Good night, Barry!" she says, after a few seconds.

"Good night, Rose!" I say, as she turns around and leaves the room.

After she left, I ate a few more muffins, and then I went to sleep. I woke up several hours later, to the sound of Daren's voice.

 "Barry, wake up!" he says. "You're not planning on sleeping in again, are you? Come on, get up, or we'll leave you behind!"
As Daren leaves, I take a look outside my window, and I see that the sun had only just risen about an hour ago. Everyone was already waiting outside, while Rose's siblings were running around the yard, as lively as ever. 

I jump out of bed and get dressed, but I don't take my backpack with me. Daren probably only meant that we were going downtown to get some supplies. I take some money with me, and my dagger, just in case, and then I head downstairs. 

"About time," Daren says, as I approach everyone who was waiting in the yard. "What took you so long?"

"Where are we going?" I ask Rose, as I completely ignore Daren's question.

"We're going to a hospital from the Beggar's district," Rose says. "I went there yesterday, after visiting the Sparrow's district, and I saw a lot of wounded who weren't being treated properly due to a severe lack of qualified personnel. None of them seemed to be in critical condition, but Daren's healing spells would be a godsend to those people. At first, I only wanted to bring Daren, but Hadrik insisted that we all go."

Rose blushes.

 I jump out of bed and get dressed, but I don't take my backpack with me. Daren probably only meant that we were going downtown to get some supplies. I take some money with me, and my dagger, just in case, and then I head downstairs. 
Rose wasn't in my room when I woke up, which means that she most likely left early, in order to avoid turning us into today's main headline. It was probably for the best. I don't think I could bear to look at Hadrik's smug grin if he ever found out about what happened last night.

"About time," Daren says, as I approach everyone who was waiting in the yard. "What took you so long?"

"Where are we going?" I ask Rose, as I completely ignore Daren's question.

"We're going to a hospital from the Beggar's district," Rose says.

"It's safer if we all stick together," Hadrik says. "Just because we're in a city, it doesn't mean that we can let our guards down. We're still in the middle of a deadly tournament, after all."

"Alright, is everyone ready?" Rose says.

"Wait, Rose, I just remembered I wanted to ask you something!" Flower says.

"Yes, Flower, what is it?" Rose asks.

 "Did something happen to you while you were in your room, last night?" Flower says.
"No, nothing happened, why do you ask?" Rose says.

"Well, I thought that you might have been afraid of getting attacked in your sleep, or something, since this morning I saw you come out of Barry's room, instead of yours," Flower says.

After Flower finishes her sentence, her eyes suddenly turn bright blue, as Illuna smacks herself hard in the forehead. Rose's face had turned completely red, and everyone was now looking straight at us.

"Rose," Kate says, looking very flustered. "D-d-did you and Barry--"

"Hahahaha!" Hadrik laughs loudly. "Way to go, Barry! I always knew you had it in you!"

"Wait," Rose says, trying hard not to panic. "This isn't what you think! It was only for one night! We're not--"

Daren coughs loudly, all of a sudden, and he drowns out Rose's words.

"Rose," he says. "Which way did you say the hospital was again? Are we taking the same route as yesterday?"

 "No!" Rose says, as she rushes in front of us. "There's no reason to take that roundabout way anymore. We can take a more direct path this time. Follow me, I'll show you the way."
After we left the mansion, nobody mentioned anything about me and Rose anymore. Daren's intervention seems to have been enough to bring them all back to their senses. He may be an ass most of the time, but when push comes to shove, I guess he can really be a lot of help. I owe him one for this.

 It took us less than an hour to reach the Beggar's district this time around. The foul smell was still there, but somehow it didn't bother me so much anymore. Maybe I had gotten accustomed to it in the meantime.
"Rose," Kate says, as we travel through the Beggar's district, "are you sure it's a good idea to be seen alongside us right now? We may well have become wanted criminals in this city after yesterday's incident."

"Oh, you don't need to worry about me," Rose says. "A few years ago, our king enacted a law that prevents us locals from being incriminated by simply associating with criminals from other continents. Since Varathians aren't prone to associating with outsiders in general, it is assumed that when they do, it is because they are being held hostage. The gnome king has enacted many such laws that protect us from harm over the past few years. He is seen as a king of the people, and many look up to him because of that."

 "Hostages? Has the spell protecting you from outsiders malfunctioned before now?"   
"The spell that they used to prevent you from attacking us has never been used before, as far as I know," Rose says. "I don't know how they managed to do it for this tournament, but I'm supposing that they either cooperated with a very talented mage, or they somehow got their hands on a powerful new device. So far, whenever people got invited to this continent, they would be kept under strict supervision, and they'd be teleported back if they misbehaved. However, there have been cases where outsiders have not been properly kept in check, and they've caused quite a bit of damage before they were finally punished."

"You said earlier that this king of yours is a gnome?" Hadrik says. "Did I hear that right?"

"Yes, you heard me right," Rose says.

"Are we talking about the same kind of gnomes, here?" Hadrik asks. "You know, the frail looking midgets that can't grow a beard and that are even smaller than dwarves? The ones that are so disorganized that they can't even form their own country, choosing instead to live their lives as nomads who never settle down in one place for more than a few years?"

"They may be seen as disorganized by many people," Rose says, "but no one can deny the fact that they are also incredibly resourceful, and that most of the great inventors of our time are of gnome origin. The king of Thilias was also a renowned inventor before he was elected as king."

 "Elected?" Kate asks, shocked. "Do you mean to say that the current king of Thilias is not of royal blood?"
"Yes, that is what I'm saying," Rose says. "The old king of Thilias did not leave an heir, and before he died of old age he made a public announcement, saying that he wanted the next king to be elected through a vote, so that he may become a true king of the people. Naturally, the nobles did not really agree with this, but they couldn't defy the king openly, so they were forced to hold the vote, despite their misgivings. Since Golmyck was very well known for his inventions and for his cheerful personality, he quickly became the favorite candidate, and he was eventually chosen by a vast majority to rule over our kingdom."

"I don't mean to interrupt," Illuna says, "but is this marketplace supposed to be so deserted at this hour? I would have expected at least the merchants to be awake at this time in the morning."

"No, you're right," Rose says. "This is strange. Usually this place is filled with people around this time of day. And come to think of it, most of the streets that we've passed so far have been empty as well."

"This smells like an ambush to me," Hadrik says.

 "Yeah, it's definitely an ambush," Arraka says. "There are two mages heading our way right now. They will appear in front of us, once they pass that corner."
Just as Arraka finishes her sentence, the whole area around us is lit by a bright green light for a few seconds, and immediately afterwards, Rose loses her consciousness and falls on the ground. Daren rushes to her side, in order to check her pulse, and he signals to us that she is still alive.

 "How does this king of the people get along with the nobles?"
"Not very well," Rose says. "He's been trying to take away many of their unfair privileges over the years, and that obviously didn't sit very well with them. However, since he is still rather new and inexperienced, the nobles have managed to keep him in check for the time being."

"You said earlier that this king of yours is a gnome?" Hadrik says. "Did I hear that right?"

"Yes, you heard me right," Rose says.

 "Where did that light come from?" Hadrik asks. "Did those two mages do it?"
"It's very likely," Illuna says. "You may not have realized it because I am still controlling the body, but Flower has also fainted, and I can't wake her up. She looks like she's in some kind of a stasis, much like the one I put her in when we were at the ogre fort."

As Daren tries to wake Rose up, the two mages that were coming our way finally make their appearance. One of them is dressed in black robes and has a snake tattoo on his bald head, while the other one is wearing green robes and a silver circlet on his head. I immediately recognize them as being the two followers of the God of Death and the God of Fate that tried to kill us with the stillwater skeletons on the day that we met Hadrik.

"So much for your stupid trap, Zack," the mage in the green robes says. "We paid all of that money and all we managed to do is knock out the one member of their team who can't even put up a fight."

"Silence, fool," Zack says. "The merchant warned us that the trap had a low chance of success against trained mages. And we didn't just get one of them, we got two. If you look closely, you can see that the little girl is actually a fusion of two souls. We managed to put the host in a dormant state, while the banshee is still keeping control of the body."

"You!" Daren shouts at the two mages. "How are you still here after hurting Rose? Why didn't the tournament's spell send you back?"

 "I would ask you the same thing, healer in armor," says the mage in green robes. "Didn't you or one of your friends kill a local yesterday? That is what it says on this poster, after all."
He takes a rolled up poster out of his sleeve, and he unfurls it in front of us, so we can all see its contents. On the piece of paper, we see some poorly drawn sketches of me, Daren, Kate and Eiden along with a title that says: 'Wanted - Dead or Alive - Daren, the healer in armor, and his accomplices, for the murder of the earl of Ollendor'. The reward on our heads is in a local currency that I am unfamiliar with, but I'm guessing that they're probably offering a lot of money, given the circumstances.

"We just happened to see this poster yesterday while we were looking for a few bounties to kill some time," the mage in the green robes says, "and we quickly agreed that it was no mere coincidence, but the hand of fate that was guiding our actions."

"It wasn't fate," Zack says, "it was the God of Death himself who was giving us another chance to make up for our miserable failure from last week. This time we'll make sure to send you all to your graves, in the name of my god."
