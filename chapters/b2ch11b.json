Listen, even if that caretaker is really trying to help us escape, you are still forgetting one thing.\"<br/>Diane then points towards her neck, which has a collar around it, similar to the ones that the golden fox used against us.<br/><br/>\"As long as Jason and I are still wearing these collars, we won't be able to get out of here,\" Diane says. \"If we get too far away from this place, the collars will electrocute us, and that will be the end of our escape. But you don't have a collar! You're one of the rejects. If you really trust this man, then you could--\"<br/><br/>\"No!\" Kate says, as she almost shouts by mistake. \"You always do that! You always try to put your friends' needs before your own. I'm not going to let you do that now! We can all escape together. You, me, Leila, your brother--\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not sure how much Jason would agree with this plan,\" Diane says. \"You know how he is. He never trusts anyone. Especially if they're lessathi. He was like this even before we knew about the test of loyalty. He barely even exchanges any words with the high-ranked lessathi that we are sent to escort on a regular basis. The only one that he seems to get along with is that woman... Meridith. Their second in command. I don't know what he sees in her. He always tells me how she's different from the other high-ranked lessathi, but for me, they're all the same. They all know what's happening here. They're not blind. They're all to blame.\"<br/><br/> \"Diane, listen to me!\" Kate says. \"That caretaker is very skilled at tinkering with magical devices. I'm sure that he could find a way to free you of your collars. I will talk to him about this with the first opportunity, but you need to find a way to convince your brother to come with us. Can you do that?\"<br/>\"You're asking a lot of me, Kate...\" Diane says. \"If I tell Jason your story about how you came from the future, he'll think I'm insane. I'm not even sure how much I believe what you're saying. I mean... are you sure that it couldn't have been a hallucination of some sort? They've been feeding us really poorly, lately, and--\"<br/><br/>\"No!\" Kate says. \"It's real! In a year from now, they're going to shut down the Beacon, due to lack of funds, and then they're going to throw all of us rejects in the jungle to fend for ourselves. I wasn't able to save even one of them... I can't let that happen again! I need to find a way to convince everyone. Just promise me that you'll try to talk to your brother. You don't need to tell him that I'm from the future. Just try to find a way to get through to him. Somehow...\"<br/><br/> \"I'll... try...\" Diane says, hesitantly.<br/>\"Thank you,\" Kate says. \"I will come to talk to you again, after speaking with the caretaker about the collars. I'm sure we'll be able to work something out. See you soon!\"<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" Arraka says, as Kate walks out of the room. \"I took a quick look through the following events, and I think it should be safe to skip the next part. I'll just go ahead and--\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" I say. \"What's the next part about?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Arraka says, \"it's just some uninteresting stuff about her talking with the caretaker, and him confirming that it's possible to take off the collars. It's a waste of time.\"<br/><br/>",

Kate is the only one in the cell, and from what I can tell, she is currently having a conversation with a person standing outside of her window. I can't see his face, because he is hiding behind the wall, but I can only guess that it's the lessathi to whom Leila refers as her father.<br/><br/>\"Those collars will be tricky to deal with,\" I hear the caretaker say, \"but I should be able to remove them, with the right tools. It will take time, however, and it can't be done while organizing an escape. What I could do instead is to disable their electrocuting effects until we are safely out of this place. It would still leave them unable to use their magic, but the important part is that they won't get killed when they will step out of the Beacon.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_skip1 || 0) == 0) {%> \"Yes, that is exactly what we need!\" Kate says. \"Thank you!

If you're not careful, someone is going to report you to the higher ups, and the escape plan will be ruined. I have a plan on how to convince them to trust you, but you will need to give me some time. Come back tomorrow, and we'll talk more about this.\"<br/>\"Very well,\" the lessathi says. \"I must leave you now, in order to tend to my daily tasks. We will talk again tomorrow.\"<br/><br/>\"Finally!\" Arraka says. \"I thought they'd never shut up.

This person, who is currently talking with Diane, is a boy in his late teens, with short, blond hair, which I assume is her brother, Jason. His overall physique is not very impressive, but the look in his eyes is much more mature than one would expect from a boy of his age. He looks like the sort of guy who is very confident in his abilities and who knows exactly what he wants. Just like his sister, he is also wearing a collar around his neck, and he is dressed in rags.<br/><br/>\"Diane,\" Jason says, \"I've told you many times before that you should take everything Kate tells you with a grain of salt. I know that she is your best friend, but that girl is way too trusting for her own good. When you put so much trust into people, it hurts that much more when you inevitably get betrayed. Mark my words, one day, she will get betrayed so badly, that she will never want to trust anyone ever again, and when that happens, you won't be able to tell me that I didn't warn you...\"<br/><br/>\"So, you're saying, what... that she should be more like you?\" Diane says. \"Ever since I've known you, you've never trusted anyone other than yourself. How is that any better?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_skip1 || 0) == 2) {%> \"Hey, don't say things like that...\" Jason says. \"You know that I've always trusted you. Even if the whole world betrays us, you and I will still continue to stay true to each other, until the very end. That's the promise we made, right before we were first assigned as elite bodyguards to the lessathi, three years ago. You still remember that promise, right?\"<br/>\"Of course I do!\" Diane says. \"But do YOU still remember it? I've been telling you for years that Meridith is bad news, and that you should keep your distance from her, but you never listen! Why is it that you are so willing to put your trust in her, when you've never trusted anyone in your life?\"<br/><br/>\"I never said I trust her!\" Jason says. \"She's just... a means to an end. That's all there is to it. And besides, she's not like the other lessathi. She has the potential to change things for the better. All she needs is a little push in the right direction. There are already many lessathi who support her. I'd even go as far as saying that there are more who currently support her, than the ones who support the great leader, Heksol. It's not by coincidence, that she managed to become second in command. When she first started off, she was only a lowly secretary to Heksol, but she's been climbing her way up the ranks for twenty years, and she's made many friends during that time. I'm telling you, there will be a great change coming soon, in the lessathi world, and I want to be right at the heart of it, when it happens!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_skip1 || 0) == 2) {%> \"You know I don't like it when you talk like this...\" Diane says. \"I thought that our goal was to escape this place. Why would we care about the lessathi world, and how they change for the better? Let them rot, for all I care! I only want to be free of this nightmare, so we can live the rest of our lives in peace together. All three of us.\"<br/>\"And we will!\" Jason says. \"What I'm doing is for the sake of all of us. Kate included. You'll understand when you're older.\"<br/><br/>\"You always say this!\" Diane says. \"What about Kate's plan, regarding the lessathi caretaker? Are you at least going to consider it?\"<br/><br/>\"I'll... think about it,\" Jason says. \"Anyway, I need to get going. If I stay too much here, the guards will start to think that we're plotting something. Take care!\"<br/><br/>\"Well that was, uh... interesting,\" Arraka says. \"Anyway, let's get back to the stuff that's actually somewhat relevant to this ritual.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

        "text": " As soon as Arraka stops talking, we get transported into a different room, where Kate is currently talking with a girl that has light brown hair, and who appears to be around fifteen years of age. Just like Kate and Diane, she is dressed in some old, tattered clothes, but her hair is less messy, and she seems to be taking much more care of her physical appearance than the other two girls. She also has a pleasant smile, and a charismatic way of talking, which makes me think that she is the type who easily gets along with other people.<br/>\"Please,\" Kate says. \"You are the only one who can help me. The other orphans never listen to me, but I'm sure they'll listen to you! You've always had a way with words, and everyone trusts your judgment. You're almost like a leader, of sorts.\"<br/><br/>\"You flatter me, Kate!\" the girl says. \"But this isn't an easy task you are asking of me. Do you not remember what happened the last time when we decided to trust one of the caretakers? The lessathi chose to kill only one of us, back then, in order to set an example, but that could have been any one of us. They had no reason to choose Benjamin, out of all of us. He didn't stand out in any way. He didn't even say a word. But they simply kept beating him and beating him in front of us, and they just wouldn't stop. Even after he was dead, they still wouldn't stop. If we try to escape again, and they catch us, I don't think that they will settle for killing only one person, anymore. This time, they're going to kill all of us, and they're not going to show us any mercy...\"<br/><br/> \"They're going to try to kill us anyway!\" Kate says. \"We're both rejects. When they'll finally be done experimenting on us, they'll throw us in a jungle, and they'll leave us for dead.\"<br/>\"We can't stay rejects forever!\" the girl says, although I can clearly see that she is lying to herself. \"Maybe one day we'll be like your friend, Diane, and her brother, and we'll get to escort important lessathi around instead of being experimented on, over and over. If we haven't died from the experiments for such a long time, then there has to still be a chance!\"<br/><br/>\"It's not going to happen, Olivia,\" Kate says. \"We can't just keep waiting for things to get better. We need to take matters into our own hands. Please, trust me on this! Following the caretaker's plan is our only true chance of escaping this hellhole. He's not going to betray us like the one before. We can still make it out of here alive, but I need your help!\"<br/><br/>Olivia starts to calm down, after she hears what Kate had to say, and all of a sudden, she gets a very determined look in her eyes.<br/><br/> \"I understand, Kate,\" Olivia says. \"You know that I've always been your friend. If you are willing to put so much trust into this man, then I will believe in you, and your judgment. I will try to convince as many people as I can, but I can't promise you anything. I'll tell you later how things went.\"<br/>\"Thank you so much!\" Kate says, with a relieved look on her face. \"I will also talk to Diane and tell her what you said. We'll talk more when you have something new to tell me. See you later!\"<br/><br/>\"Goodbye!\" Olivia says, as she regains her pleasant smile from before, and then Kate goes to exit her room.<br/><br/>\"Okay, this next part's going to be really good,\" Arraka says. \"Get ready!\"<br/><br/>The environment around us changes yet again, but this time, we find ourselves in a very large underground hallway, where about a hundred or so orphans are currently all lined up, and standing straight, while looking at a few men dressed in dark blue robes, in front of them. I'm assuming that the men in blue robes are the lessathi that run the place, but what's strange is that all of them are standing up, except for one, who is currently on his knees, with his hood covering his face, and his head bowed down.<br/><br/>",

On the other hand, if you have a way to access the Magium directly, from the earthen plane, then that natural affinity of yours will suddenly become a lot more useful.

Leaving aside the fact that you are probably getting far less information from the Magium than a regular lessathi, due to being half human, most of that information is completely useless to you, because you have no way to process it. On the other hand, if you have a way to access the Magium directly, from the earthen plane, then that natural affinity of yours will suddenly become a lot more useful. The lessathi on this continent already HAVE direct access to the Magium. That's why an affinity to it would be helpful for them. But again, this is all just a theory, until I make my test.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Wasn't that knowledge somehow taken from the Magium as well? Hmm...\"<br/>\"You do realize,\" I say, \"that if you're going to keep giving me so much information about the Magium, I will eventually figure out what it is, right?\"<br/><br/>\"So what?...\" Arraka says. \"Do I look like I care? This is all a game to me. I couldn't care less if you find out the true nature of the Magium. I've only been hiding it from you because I find your reactions to be amusing. It's not like I was forbidden to talk about this by the Magium itself, like Flower and Illuna.\"<br/><br/>\"What did you just say?...\" I ask her, shocked.<br/><br/>\"Arraka, don't say another word,\" Illuna says, with a mixture of both anger and fear in her eyes. \"I'm warning you!\"<br/><br/> \"Warning me?\" Arraka says. \"Warning ME? Has our little trip to this parallel universe managed to completely fry your brain? Do you forget who you are talking to? I am Arraka! Even the gods live in fear of me! Do you seriously think that I am going to let myself get intimidated by the likes of the Magium? The Magium is nothing but a tool! A tool that I can freely manipulate, without even breaking a sweat! Why would I have anything to fear? Do you think I'm like you? Well, Barry, you're in luck! Today, you will finally find out what the Magium is! You see, it is all pretty simple, once you think about it. If you take into account everything that I've told you about the world we are in now, and if you also remember everything you already knew, then the answer that is staring you right in the face is that the Magium is in fact--\"<br/><br/> Right before Arraka got to finish her sentence, I felt a sensation that was so terrifying and so hard to put into words, that any threat I might have felt to my life from the likes of Arraka and the God of Time simply paled in comparison to what I felt just now. It was no longer a question of fearing for my life. I was fearing for my very existence. I felt the whole world flicker around me, for a fraction of a second, as if everything froze in time and lost all of its color. Then, within the same fraction of a second, it all simply vanished from right before my eyes, and all I could see now was emptiness. An emptiness that stretched for miles and miles, even though it was made of nothing.<br/>What felt like a moment, also felt like an eternity at the same time, and during that eternity which lasted for less than a second, I got to experience the sheer dread of complete non-existence. Not only had my life been wiped away, but the very notion of me had been completely erased from the tapestry of the universe. For that fraction of a second, I was nothing, and yet, I was still there, somewhere, trapped for an eternity in a complete void, while trying in vain to make sense of the utter absurdity of my situation.<br/><br/>Once I find myself back in my semi-transparent body and in a world full of color, I suddenly realize that I am completely drenched in cold sweat, and that I can feel my heart beating in my chest like a very loud drum. Flower also seems to be frozen in shock, as she simply stares straight ahead of her, without saying a word.<br/><br/>",

As Arraka stays completely silent, the world flickers around us once again, and I can feel myself fading in and out of existence several times in a row, before I get returned to the underground hallway, sweating harder than ever.<br/><br/>\"Are you going to just stay silent until we get erased from existence?!\" Illuna shouts at Arraka again.<br/><br/>\"Shut up!\" Arraka says, with a slight tremble of fear in her voice. \"I'm trying to fix this, but I can't do it if you keep distracting me. Just... give me a minute!\"<br/><br/> As we wait for Arraka to finish what she is doing, the world turns black and white one more time, but now it is flickering much more rapidly than before, and it feels like this time, my consciousness is going to get trapped into the void for good. Just when I am about to give up all hope, I suddenly get pulled back in my body, and the world around us comes back to normal, while both Flower and I are breathing very rapidly, and looking at each other, as we're trying to make at least some sense of our situation.<br/>\"Okay...\" Arraka says, with a bit of panic still left in her voice. \"This should be enough for now... We shouldn't be getting any more interference.\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean this should be enough for now?\" Illuna says. \"Did you or did you not solve the problem?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Arraka says. \"I think... I don't know! I've never done anything like this before. I diverted the Magium's attention away from us, by using some tricks that I learned from the God of Fate. I heard that he had to do a similar thing in the heat of the moment, when they tampered with the Magium to banish me from their realm. And given that they all managed to escape without being erased from existence, then so should we!\"<br/><br/> \"You're saying that you used an illusion to create a distraction?...\" I say. <br/>\"Well, if you really want to make a comparison, then it was more like a ridiculously complicated suggestion spell,\" Arraka says. \"Technically, it's still searching for us, but in a completely different world. As long as I manage to keep my idiot mouth shut this time around, it shouldn't be able to find us again.\"<br/><br/>\"So you admit that you were an idiot, then?\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Arraka shouts. \"Yes, I admit it! Are you happy now? I was an idiot to try and challenge the Magium in its own territory. All of my thousands of years of knowledge are nearly useless, when faced with this world of contradictions and absurdities. Now let's calm ourselves down, and finish doing what we originally came here to do. I no longer want to spend any more time in here than is absolutely necessary.\"<br/><br/>",

We've told her in the past that if she ever managed to make a significant contribution to our cause, then we would consider giving her a more important role in our organization, and with the help she's provided to us today, she might just obtain that position. In short, your friend, Olivia, came to us today to warn us about the traitor, and also to warn us that there might be others, willing to join him. She then agreed to carry a transceiver with her, and to keep it open, so that we could hear her talking to the traitor, and to all of the children that said they wanted to join in on the escape plan. Since we already have all the proof we need, we will expect you to come quietly to the front, without posing any resistance, as soon as your names are called.\"<br/><br/>He then coughs loudly before he continues.<br/><br/>\"There are four names on our list,\" the lessathi says. \"William, Hannah, Lillian and Matthew. Please don't waste any more of our time by pretending that you didn't hear us call you. I think we all know what happens to those who openly try to disobey us...\"<br/><br/> The four orphans whose names were called are now all stepping forward, with their eyes looking at the ground. When they stop, in front of the lessathi, we see that they are all shaking in fear, but they are not saying a word.<br/>\"Good,\" the lessathi says. \"Starting tomorrow, you will all be sent to room fifty-one, in order to commence your re-education process. Is that clear?\"<br/><br/>\"No, please not fifty-one!\" shouts a thirteen year old boy who is one of the four orphans that were called by the lessathi. \"Anything but that! Have mercy, I beg you!\"<br/><br/>\"Don't make the mistake of assuming that you have any choice in the matter,\" the bearded lessathi says. \"Every single complaint that you make from now on will only add more time to the penalty for all four of you. Now tell me, do you have any more complaints?\"<br/><br/>\"No, sir...\" the boy says, in a voice that sounded like he was one step away from crying.<br/><br/> \"Splendid,\" the lessathi says. \"Now, then, Olivia, I would like to ask you one final question. Were there any other orphans who might have wanted to conspire with the traitor? Perhaps some of the children who you might have talked to before you came to us, to obtain the transceiver?\"<br/>When she is asked the question, Olivia takes a very short glance towards Kate, out of instinct, but then she goes back to looking right in front of her.<br/><br/>\"No, sir...\" Olivia says. \"There was no one else.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" the lessathi says. \"Rest assured, you will be rewarded for your efforts. You may be a reject, but even for someone like you, there is a place in our organization, as long as you keep proving yourself useful.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes...\" Olivia says, in a very meek tone of voice. \"That is all I've ever wanted. To be useful...\"<br/><br/>\"Let us take these traitors to a temporary holding cell, until we make all the necessary arrangements,\" the lessathi says, as he now addresses his colleagues. \"Tomorrow, we will begin their re-education process.\"<br/><br/>",

Every single person in the room is now staring at Kate, as the bearded lessathi slowly approaches her.<br/><br/>\"What did you just say?...\" the bearded lessathi says, calmly, as soon as he reaches her. <br/><br/>\"I said they did nothing wrong!\" Kate says, with a somewhat shakier voice. \"All they wanted was to escape this hellhole of a place. How can you blame them for wanting that?\"<br/><br/>\"Strange...\" the lessathi says. \"I don't remember you ever being brave enough to stand up to us before. In fact, I remember you as being both very timid, and obedient. Your aura seems different from how I remembered it as well. I wonder what could have happened, to cause such a great change in your personality... Perhaps we should try to dissect you and find out. You are a reject after all. It's not like your death would be much of a loss to us.\"<br/><br/> \"No, leave her alone!\" Diane shouts, from the other side of the room, as a tear flows from her eye. \"Don't you dare touch her!\"<br/>\"What is this supposed to be?...\" the bearded lessathi says, as he now turns towards Diane. \"Some sort of rebellion? Do you think you're going to receive special treatment, just because you're one of our elite bodyguards? Or did you forget that you can't cast any magic with that collar around your neck, unless we specifically allow you to do it?\"<br/><br/>He then goes closer to Diane, and he grabs her by the hair, in order to make sure that she looks straight into his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Do you think that you are beyond our reach, just because you routinely escort our great leaders?\" the lessathi says. \"Do you think you no longer have to worry about our punishments? Maybe we should send you to room fifty-one for re-education as well. I'm sure the leaders would not mind having a more obedient servant...\"<br/><br/> \"What is the meaning of this?!\" we hear a woman shout, as she is just now entering our hallway, and walking fast towards the bearded lessathi.<br/>The lessathi woman who shouted appears to be in her late thirties, with long brown hair and green eyes, and she is wearing a dark blue robe, just like every other lessathi in the room. She is being escorted by two lessathi men, who are both carrying weapons.<br/><br/>\"Lady Meridith...\" the bearded lessathi says, as he immediately releases Diane. \"I thought that you and our lord, Heksol, had already finished your inspection of the Beacon...\"<br/><br/>\"Lord Heksol left early this morning,\" Meridith says. \"But I still had some unfinished business here, so I chose to remain for a while longer. What were you doing just now, to my loyal bodyguard?\"<br/><br/>\"Lady Meridith!\" Diane says, in a shaky voice. \"They were trying to kill her. They were trying to kill Kate! They said they wanted to dissect her, to find out why she stood up to them.\"<br/><br/>",

But this reject was trying to give us orders! She was telling us that we have no right to take the orphans away with us.\"<br/><br/>\"What exactly is this... re-education process that you keep telling me about?\" Meridith says.<br/><br/> \"The re-education process is an extreme measure that we take against those who are caught trying to break our rules more than once,\" the lessathi says. \"All of the rule breakers will be taken to a special room, and there they will be tortured, repeatedly, for the duration of a few months, until they will be made completely obedient. The brainwashing techniques that we use are of the highest quality, and they are meant to ensure that every ounce of free will is completely eradicated, while leaving their intellect intact, so they can still understand and follow our orders. The children that pass through the re-education process usually stop interacting with their peers altogether, and they rarely ever talk, unless they are directly asked a question by us. In other words, they become the perfect test subjects. Our re-education technique has been refined throughout the years, and we are very proud of the results it has given us, especially in the last few months.\"<br/>\"You dare to say all this to my face?\" Meridith says, with a furious look in her eyes. \"And you even present these barbarities to me as if they were some sort of accomplishment, deserving of praise? What in the gods' names is wrong with you? These are all children! How is it possible to be this cruel? When I saw how the experiments are run in this place, I already had my doubts, but I never thought you would go this far!\"<br/><br/> \"But Lady Meridith...\" the bearded lessathi says. \"Lord Heksol has already approved--\"<br/>\"I don't care what Lord Heksol did or did not approve!\" Meridith says. \"Give me all of your names. And give me a list of all your procedures. Bring them to me now. If I see any more insane 'techniques' like this written in your documentation, I'm going to cross them all out, and if you ever dare to use them again, you will answer not only with your job, but with your life, do you understand?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, madam...\" the lessathi says, reluctantly. \"I will bring the documents to you at once.\"<br/><br/>\"And the rest of you!\" Meridith says, while looking towards the other lessathi. \"I will hear your sides of the story right now. You'd better not skip any important details. I don't think you'd want to anger me any further.\"<br/><br/>\"Wow, that was a pretty interesting development...\" Arraka says. \"Isn't Meridith the lessathi's current leader?

I thought that the Magium was supposed to remain in a state of constant hibernation, unless you tried to mess around with the really important stuff, like that time when Memphir banished me from the magical plane. I didn't think it would wake up just from me trying to reveal its true nature! And now that I woke it up, I'm not sure how long it will stay up, or what are the extents of its capabilities. We are going to keep spectating rituals for as long as it takes, until I can be absolutely certain that the way out is clear.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, fine...\" Illuna says. \"Do what you think is best.\"<br/><br/>While we were talking, Meridith was just getting done with interrogating the lessathi, and she was sending them on their way.<br/><br/> \"When you see the caretaker who was bringing me the documents, tell him to come to my temporary office,\" Meridith tells the lessathi who are now leaving the room.<br/>She then turns towards her lessathi bodyguards.<br/><br/>\"Go on ahead,\" she tells them. \"I'll be with you in a second.\"<br/><br/>As her bodyguards are leaving the way they came in, Meridith approaches Kate, and she bends over, so she can talk in a low voice, in her ear.<br/><br/>\"What you did back there was very brave,\" Meridith says. \"But bravery by itself is worthless unless you also have the power to enforce your own ideals upon others. Remember this advice.\"<br/><br/>She then taps her lightly on her shoulder and she goes to follow her two bodyguards, out of the room. Shortly after Meridith leaves, the whole room gets covered in a bright white light, and as soon as the light is gone, I realize that we are now situated in Kate's holding cell, where Kate is also standing somewhere beside us, looking around her, confused.<br/><br/>",

The Beacon got shut down before Meridith took over, as far as I know, so her actions probably didn't have any meaningful contribution.\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka,\" Illuna says, \"don't you think we should be focusing on escaping this place instead of having casual conversations?\"<br/><br/>\"I AM focusing on escaping,\" Arraka says. \"The only reason why I'm continuing with the ritual is to calm my nerves, while I try to make an escape plan.\"<br/><br/>\"Why can't we just go out the way we came in?\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Because I'm not sure if it's safe!\" Arraka says. \"Normally, I would waltz right out of here without a second thought, but this carelessness of mine is what got us into this mess in the first place.

Remember this advice.\"<br/><br/>She then taps her lightly on her shoulder and she goes to follow her two bodyguards, out of the room. Shortly after Meridith leaves, the whole room gets covered in a bright white light, and as soon as the light is gone, I realize that we are now situated in Kate's holding cell, where Kate is also standing somewhere beside us, looking around her, confused.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"So, are you any closer to finding a way that gets us out of here safely?\" I say.<br/>\"It's hard to say,\" Arraka tells me. \"I've been making progress, but there are still a lot of verifications that need to be done. Like I said, I'm not doing anything until I can be absolutely certain that there are no risks.\"<br/><br/>\"Right...\" I say.<br/><br/>As we keep watching Kate go back in time over and over again, her tries seem to be getting more desperate with each new time loop. She is now trying to save even Olivia from the Beacon, because she is under the impression that the reason why time is repeating itself is that she didn't manage to save every single one of the orphans from their prison. Her tries have gotten her captured numerous times, but luckily for her, even in the cases where she didn't get rescued by Meridith, the time would always reset itself at the end of the day, so the lessathi never managed to finish their preparations for her dissection, or her re-education process, before she was sent back.<br/><br/>After many more attempts, Kate finally managed to get everyone out safely, including Olivia, although the time would obviously still keep repeating itself, even in the most perfect possible scenarios. The optimism that could be seen on Kate's face after the first few successful rescue attempts was now gradually turning into despair, as she was slowly starting to suspect that completing her ritual would require a completely different course of action on her part.<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" Arraka says. \"I think she's finally starting to get what's happening, here. I'm still expecting her to be in denial about it, for at least five more time loops, though. Anyway, never mind that. What's more important is that I may have actually found a proper way out of here, but I need to time it perfectly. Get ready to experience some strong nausea, because our comfort will be the very last thing on my mind while we escape this place.\"<br/>After Arraka finishes her sentence, I feel a strong headache, all of a sudden, and then we all get transported back to our real world, in the blink of an eye. Once we return to our regular, non-transparent bodies, we take a look around, and we see that we are still standing in the middle of the same forest where we were when our rituals started, next to all of our friends. It appears that the time is still frozen in this world, and that not everyone has managed to get out of their trance just yet. The ones who finished their rituals aside from us seem to be Melindra, Leila, Hadrik and the revenant, who are all looking at us, while Daren and Kate are still staring blankly in front of them, with bright, glowy eyes.<br/><br/>\"We made it...\" Arraka says, sounding both surprised and relieved at the same time. \"We made it! We got out of there alive. Hahahahahaha! Take that, Magium, you son of a bitch!\"<br/><br/>\"Could you maybe avoid taunting the Magium when we are still technically standing right on its doorstep?\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Relax!\" Arraka says. \"Everything is under control. I got us out of there alive, didn't I? And besides, I wasn't even insulting it. I was giving it a compliment, by treating it as if it were an actual person.\"<br/><br/> \"You are acting as if you've already forgotten what can happen when you ignore my warnings...\" Illuna says, in a serious tone. \"Would you perhaps like me to give you a small reminder by transporting us back into the world we just escaped from?\"<br/>It seems that Illuna's question has rendered Arraka completely silent. After a few more seconds of waiting for an answer, Illuna continues.<br/><br/>\"You know that I can do it,\" she says. \"You're the one who taught me everything I know, after all...\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, you win!\" Arraka says, in a somewhat panicked tone. \"I'll shut my mouth, okay? It was just a little gloating, that's all... You don't have to get so upset over it!\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka sounding scared?\" Hadrik says, with a grin, although I can see from the uneasy look in his eyes that he is still affected by whatever happened to him in his ritual. \"Now, that's something you don't see every day!\"<br/><br/>",

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, what's happening here?\" I ask Arraka. \"How did it come to this?\"<br/><br/> \"I'm trying to find out,\" Arraka says. \"Just give me a minute, while I take a short look at what's been going on so far.\"<br/>After about twenty seconds of hearing nothing but the sound of Rose's soft weeping, Arraka finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she is now trying to summarize to us what she's seen.<br/><br/>\"Okay, so this ritual seems to be a little different from the others,\" Arraka says. \"Instead of forcing her to recreate only one event from her past, she actually needs to repeat more of them, in succession. Basically, she has to willingly ignore all of the slaves that have ever asked her for help, just like she's done in the past, except now she's also being forced to witness what happens with those slaves, after she refuses to help them. Some of them have been brutally murdered by their masters, some of them have been left to die of hunger, others have been tortured non-stop for weeks, until they went crazy. All sorts of stuff. I don't think this ritual of hers will end until she gets to see the fate of every single one of the slaves she's ever ignored during her lifetime.\"<br/><br/>",

The slave girl was simply staring at her in disbelief the whole time, hoping against hope that it might all have been only a cruel joke. When she realized that Rose was being serious, the slave began to desperately pull herself away, but she was in a much too weakened state to be able to escape Rose's grasp.<br/><br/>\"No!\" the slave girl screams, as she keeps trying to free herself. \"Let me go!

I only did what I thought was right...\"<br/><br/>\"How commendable!\" the noble says, with a look full of respect in his eyes, as he puts his gold pouch back in his pocket. \"It is rare to see someone with such high moral values in this day and age. Whatever you do, remember to never let go of those principles, for it is these principles that truly make us human!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, sir, I will remember...\" Rose says.<br/><br/> \"Very well!\" the noble says. \"In that case, we will take our leave, and bother you no longer.

Did you hear what she said to that slave? Oh man, I can't believe she actually used to think like that, six years ago. How brainwashed can you be? And then there was that noble with his speech about principles! I can't take it anymore. Ahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>As Arraka continues to laugh, there is a sudden flash of light, and then we are all transported inside a fancy manor, where the noble from before is now mercilessly beating his slave to death. The slave girl is just lying on the ground, without moving or saying anything while she gets hit, and Rose is right there, in front of her, in a semi-transparent form, watching the scene unfold in front of her eyes with a horrified look on her face.<br/><br/>",

Once we return to our regular, non-transparent bodies, we take a look around, and we see that we are still standing in the middle of the same forest where we were when our rituals started, next to all of our friends. It appears that the time is still frozen in this world, and that not everyone has managed to get out of their trance just yet. The ones who finished their rituals aside from us seem to be Melindra, Leila and Hadrik, who are all looking at us, while Daren, Kate and Rose are still staring blankly in front of them, with bright, glowy eyes.<br/>\"We made it...\" Arraka says, sounding both surprised and relieved at the same time. \"We made it! We got out of there alive. Hahahahahaha! Take that, Magium, you son of a bitch!\"<br/><br/>\"Could you maybe avoid taunting the Magium when we are still technically standing right on its doorstep?\" Illuna says.<br/><br/> \"Relax!\" Arraka says. \"Everything is under control.

I was giving it a compliment, by treating it as if it were an actual person.\"<br/>\"You are acting as if you've already forgotten what can happen when you ignore my warnings...\" Illuna says, in a serious tone. \"Would you perhaps like me to give you a small reminder by transporting us back into the world we just escaped from?\"<br/><br/>It seems that Illuna's question has rendered Arraka completely silent. After a few more seconds of waiting for an answer, Illuna continues.<br/><br/>\"You know that I can do it,\" she says. \"You're the one who taught me everything I know, after all...\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, you win!\" Arraka says, in a somewhat panicked tone. \"I'll shut my mouth, okay? It was just a little gloating, that's all... You don't have to get so upset over it!\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka sounding scared?\" Hadrik says, with a grin, although I can see from the uneasy look in his eyes that he is still affected by whatever happened to him in his ritual. \"Now, that's something you don't see every day!\"<br/><br/>",
