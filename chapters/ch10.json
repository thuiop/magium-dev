If word gets out, we're going to become the laughing stock of the tournament.\"<br/><br/>It has now been close to six hours since we were teleported to our prison cell. I can tell because my stats device also shows me the hour of the day, in addition to my stats. Otherwise, it would have been almost impossible to find out how much time had passed, because not only are there no windows in our cell, but also no sources of light whatsoever, except for the small light coming from my stat booster's screen. <br/><br/>For the past few hours, we've been trying to shake off the permanent paralysis effect of our prison cell and to come up with a plan to fool the ogre guards into releasing us. So far, we've made no significant progress on either front. Daren and Hadrik managed to remove their paralysis spells temporarily, by focusing all of their magical energy into giving their muscles a powerful jolt, but they were barely able to move three feet before the spell was automatically cast on them once more. <br/><br/>Of the five of us trapped here, I appear to be the only one that can move my hands, even if only slightly. It turns out that partial resistance to paralysis is one of the perks I get for being a lessathi, along with a higher than average resistance to electricity. That being said, this newfound ability of mine hasn't really helped me much, except for being able to take the stats device out of my pocket in order to use it as a makeshift candle.<br/><br/> Seeing that we couldn't free ourselves from the paralysis spell, we decided to shift our focus towards engineering a plan to have the ogres open the door and cancel the spell for us. Unfortunately, despite their renowned stupidity, the ogres were under strict orders to not let us go under any circumstances, and they were much too afraid of their captain to risk going against his wishes.<br/>Rose hasn't spoken a single word since we got imprisoned. Illuna's betrayal must have really affected her. The rest of us aren't exactly in the best of moods either, but we are far from having given up. Since the ogres are afraid of letting us die of starvation because of our collars, we are expecting them to come bring us food, sooner or later. <br/><br/>At the moment they open the door, Daren and Hadrik will use their muscle jolt techniques and make a run for it, in the short time they have at their disposal before they get paralyzed again. They will then find the control panel that cancels the paralysis spell, and we'll all be free to roam their stronghold at our leisure. It's not a perfect plan, but it's better than to just roll over and accept our fates.<br/>  <br/>\"That accursed banshee!\" Daren says. \"I knew from the beginning that she was plotting something. We were so heavily underequipped for this mission that I had no choice but to accept Flower's help when she offered it, but now I'm starting to regret that I didn't listen to my instincts instead.\"<br/><br/>",

The proof is that you didn't tell us about your plan beforehand.\"<br/><br/>\"I couldn't tell you beforehand, you oaf,\" Illuna says. \"Your reactions needed to be genuine when I betrayed you. The shaman can tell from your auras if you are actually shocked or just pretending. That is the reason why I had to put Flower to sleep. As a banshee, I am the only one who the shaman can't read, because I am in complete control of my emotions, as well as my aura fluctuations.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah?\" Daren says. \"Well, why don't you wake the girl up, then, so she can confirm all of this herself?\"<br/><br/> \"The stasis I put Flower in cannot be undone forcefully without risking serious complications,\" Illuna says. \"The spell usually lasts two days, so I didn't have the time to wait for her to wake up before coming to rescue you.\"<br/><br/>\"How convenient,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>The banshee frowns at him.<br/><br/>\"If you don't feel like breaking out of this cell, then I'll just take the others with me, and leave you here to rot,\" she says.<br/><br/> \"Oh, I'll come with you, don't worry,\" Daren says. \"But as soon as I get my sword back, you are in for a world of hurt.\"<br/>\"I see,\" Illuna says, as she gestures with her hand, and all of our weapons come floating inside of the cell. \"I'm not going to lie. That would be a bit problematic for me.\"<br/><br/>She then gestures with her right hand towards us, and my dagger and crossbow get thrown in my lap, while at the same time, Kate's dagger gets thrown into her right hand. The banshee then grabs Daren's sword, and she eyes him intently. Daren tries to get up, but the effect of the paralysis still hasn't completely worn off, so he staggers on his feet. After looking at him for a few seconds, Illuna decides to throw his sword to me instead.<br/><br/>\"Here, you take it,\" the banshee tells me. \"You seem to have a decent head on your shoulders and you know him better than I do. I'll let you decide whether to give him the sword or not, given the circumstances.\"<br/><br/>\"Barry...\" Daren says, as he gets up and starts walking towards me. \"Give me the sword.\"<br/><br/>He's got that look in his eyes again. I know that look. He isn't thinking straight. He's going to attack Illuna as soon as I give him his weapon back, isn't he? Just what am I supposed to do here, exactly?<br/><br/>",

The rest of us follow them out of our cell, to get a better view of the fight. So far, nobody seems keen on stopping either of them.<br/><br/>\"We're going to settle this once and for all,\" Daren says, with a serious tone in his voice. \"We fight to the very end.

The water solidifies as it reaches him, and the impact of the hit makes him unclench his fist and sends the sword flying out of his hand. The banshee then immediately makes another whip with her right hand, which quickly coils itself around Daren's waist, as it turns itself solid as well. Before Daren has the time to figure out what happened, Illuna pulls on the whip and she flings him with full force into a wall. When he tries to get back up, the banshee creates a water spear out of thin air and she points it at his neck. Despite it being made of water, the spear's tip looks sharper than regular steel. It must be the result of a technique similar to Kate's ice reinforcement.<br/>\"I don't understand...\" Daren says. \"How did you manage to throw me like that? It makes no sense!\"<br/><br/>",

The whip did so by itself, and I just mimicked the motion with my arm to make it appear like I was the one doing all the legwork.

If you do that, you'll lose your precious map that we spent all of those hours in the library to put together. I guess you'll just have to put up with me for a while longer, then. Aha- AHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br/><br/>I hadn't really paid much attention to the semi-transparent magical hologram floating in front of Illuna until Arraka mentioned it, but now I realize that it is in fact a miniature version of the ogre stronghold. Not only that, but there are also colored dots inside it that are continuously moving. I can only assume that the moving dots represent the ogre patrols from the stronghold, and that the six dots standing in place on the upper level of the left wall must represent our own group.<br/><br/>\"That's amazing!\" Kate says. \"This entire detailed hologram is being maintained by Arraka?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"We've spent a few hours in the library, documenting the stronghold's layout, in order to recreate it as accurately as possible. Arraka's magical sense is powerful enough that she can easily detect all living creatures in our area, even if their auras are being masked by that pesky shaman spell that also grants invisibility, so she can just display them as dots on the map, for all of us to see. With this much information in our hands, the ogres could not surprise us, so we've encountered no resistance while we cleaned out this entire floor and hid the bodies.\"<br/><br/>",

I made sure that she knew all kinds of obscure techniques and that she could control her water element to perfection. Then, when the time came, I led them all into one of the sacred woods. It was easy to get them to follow me. They all trusted me with their lives, and they didn't know that I was taking them into forbidden territory. Poor Unuri and Sidara were no match for the valiant guardians of the forest, and Illuna was not strong enough to fight all of the animals by herself while also protecting her friends.\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka, I'm warning you!\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Oh, and Illuna was simply adorable!\" Arraka says. \"Did I tell you? Back then she absolutely refused to kill other living creatures unless she had no other choice. She would be depressed for days after changing hosts, because she'd been forced to end someone's life without their consent! Needless to say, even in a dire situation such as this, Illuna still refused to kill the animals, and simply incapacitated them. I know this, because I was watching the whole thing from above, while laughing continuously. They didn't understand what I was doing at first. They kept calling for me, begging me to save them like I always did. They saw all of the events unfold before their eyes, but their minds simply couldn't comprehend them. It was only when Unuri and Sidara got impaled that the cold hard reality finally hit Illuna in the face.\"<br/><br/> As Arraka speaks, I can feel Illuna's aura starting to fluctuate violently. This is the first time I've ever seen her exhibit such strong emotions about something. Usually, the flow of her aura is almost indiscernible from that of the air around her.<br/>\"She kept shouting at the animals to let her pass,\" Arraka says. \"She kept telling them to get out of her way, but they wouldn't listen. So, in a fit of rage, Illuna exterminated every single one of those guardians, leaving no survivors, and then she hurried over to her friends' side, grabbing their lifeless bodies and shaking them desperately, as if she were expecting them to suddenly come back to life. 'Please!' she said. 'Don't leave me,' she said. 'I don't-- I don't want to be alone--' AHA- AHAHAHAHAHAHA--\"<br/><br/>Illuna closed the amulet and gripped it firmly in her fist. I could see her hand shaking as she held onto the amulet, and I think I could almost hear a small crack coming from it. Just as Arraka warned her, the hologram of the fort disappeared almost as soon as she closed the locket. <br/><br/>\"Bring it back,\" Illuna says, curtly, as she opens the amulet again.<br/><br/>\"Hmm?\" Arraka says. \"Bring what back? Oh, you mean the hologram? The hologram's gone. Didn't you see it go poof? I'll need hours to recreate it again. You should have listened to me when you had the chance, but nooooo, you just had to be your old stubborn self again and-- \"<br/><br/>\"I said bring it back!\" Illuna shouts at her.<br/><br/>",

I don't know how that girl puts up with you!\"<br/><br/>Illuna ignores Arraka, and she turns to Hadrik.<br/><br/>\"I trust that Arraka's explanation about the sacred woods massacre will suffice?\" she asks him, with a dark look on her face. \"Or would you perhaps like to hear more details?\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, no...\" Hadrik says. \"I think I'm good, thanks...\"<br/><br/>Illuna then turns around and starts leading us to the lower levels, as we all follow her, in silence. Thanks to Arraka's map, we were able to successfully avoid most of the guards as we made our way towards the treasure room. The ones that we couldn't avoid were quickly and silently dispatched by Illuna. Her way of doing things was completely opposite to Flower's. She was cold and calculated, and she would use the girl's athletic prowess to her advantage when going in for the kill. Every time she had to take out an ogre guard, she'd climb one of the walls, position herself above him and then hang from the ceiling to deliver the finishing blow. <br/><br/> It took us less than half an hour to reach the treasure room, situated at the lowest level of the stronghold's main building. There were only two guards at the entrance, who were easily dealt with. However, even if we made sure to hide all of the bodies on our way here, it's likely only a matter of time before an ogre patrol realizes something is wrong and raises the alarm. We're going to need to move fast and get out of here before that happens.<br/>Upon entering the ogres' treasury, I could see that it was filled with mountains upon mountains of gold, as well as dozens of coffers which had all manner of jewels and fineries inside of them. If only I had my enchanted backpack with me now, I would have filled it to the brim with treasure. Still, there's plenty of room in my pockets for me to stash a few of these small expensive gems. The diamonds in particular should fetch me a hefty sum in any respectable market. After all, when will I ever get another chance like this?<br/><br/>",

Two seconds later, we find ourselves standing in a room full of ogres, with the captain of the stronghold grinning at us maliciously.<br/><br/>\"I suspected banshee from start,\" the captain says, in his broken Common. \"I told great shaman he make mistake for trusting banshee, but shaman no listen! I knew you come here sooner or later with your friends to steal treasure, so I wait for you in secret ambush room! These are my finest warrior and they all thirst for blood!

Daren instinctively placed his shield between himself and the ogre's weapon, but the force behind the hit was so great that it sent him flying into a nearby wall.<br/><br/>Hadrik is the next one who dashes towards the captain, and the ogre hits him with his club as well. The dwarf stops the weapon by putting his hands above his head, and the floor below them is beginning to crumble from the impact of the club's strike.<br/><br/> While the two of them duel, Illuna starts to apply some pressure to the other ogres by using her water whips, while doing cartwheels all over the place in order to avoid getting hit by their clubs.<br/>\"Not bad for puny dwarf!\" the captain says. \"But let me ask something. Does dwarf know what lies beneath stronghold floor?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, it's called a hill,\" Hadrik says. \"They're kinda like mountains, only smaller. I can draw you a picture to make it easier to understand, if you want.\"<br/><br/>\"That is only partly correct, dwarf,\" the captain says, with a wicked grin. \"It's true that there is hill below us. But inside this hill, there is abandoned mines, which was used by the goblins before us. The wood in scaffolding leading down must be rotting by now. The two of us are stand right above cave wall, but I can't say the same about your friends. There is three hundred foot drop until the floor of mines.

Illuna takes advantage of this, and she uses her water whip to behead them all in a single motion.<br/><br/>\"Over here!\" she says, as she waves to us from the middle of the ogre corpses. \"This must be one of the safe areas. Quick!\"<br/><br/>The ogre captain grins widely upon hearing Illuna's words. He kicks Hadrik out of his way, and readies his club to smash the floor from underneath us.<br/><br/>",

She jumps back and forth between the pillar and the wall a few times, until she finally reaches Daren's level. She then grabs the cave's wall with her left hand, and she extends her right hand towards Daren.<br/>\"Healer, grab my hand!\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Like hell, I will!\" Daren says.<br/><br/>The wooden beam cracks again. This time it looks like it's about to break.<br/><br/>\"Healer, there's no time!\" Illuna shouts. \"Grab my damn hand!\"<br/><br/>Daren looks at her hesitantly for a few seconds, but he doesn't get the time to think on it any further, because the wooden beam finally cracks under his weight, and he starts falling into the chasm. Illuna pushes herself into the wall with all her strength and jumps towards Daren, grabbing him with her right hand.

You should be glad that you've been granted the opportunity to finish us all with your own hands!\"<br/>\"Illuna, can't you help him?\" Rose asks. \"I don't know how much longer Hadrik can keep this up...\"<br/><br/>\"The ogre is wearing anti-magic armor from head to toe,\" Illuna says. \"This means that I can't make my water sharp against him, so my whips and my arrows are out of the question. Normally, I'd use one of my whips to pull him into the chasm, but he's just too big and heavy for me to move with the amount of magical energy I have at my disposal. My stronger spells would probably penetrate his defenses, but they aren't designed to hit a single target, so I'd risk hitting the dwarf along with the ogre captain if I used them.\"<br/><br/>\"There must be something we can do...\" Rose says. <br/><br/>\"Hey, dwarf!\" Arraka shouts loudly. \"Remember how I told you that the ogres' weak spot is at the base of their necks?

Hadrik seizes the opportunity, grabs the ogre's club and throws it inside the chasm.<br/>\"Why?!\" the ogre asks, as he coughs up more blood. \"Why did go for chest instead of neck?! Wasn't secret technique supposed to aimed for weak point?\"<br/><br/>Hadrik and Arraka both start laughing simultaneously.<br/><br/>\"There was no secret technique, you moron!\" Arraka says. \"I only said that to make you panic and focus all of your defense on a single point.\"<br/><br/>\"I guess it only took two of us to defeat you after all,\" Hadrik says, grinning. \"Maybe you should have brought some real soldiers with you, instead of small fries.\"<br/><br/>\"This not over yet, dwarf,\" the ogre says, and he coughs some more. \"I'm going to crush your puny head, and--\"<br/><br/>Hadrik doesn't let the ogre finish his threat, and he crushes his head between his hands.

All of the ogres that were sleeping are waking up and taking their stations. The others are frantically patrolling the halls, as if they were looking for something. They must have discovered one of the dead bodies and raised the alarm. The shaman has just left his quarters and he's now assembling a team to follow him.\"<br/>\"That means we won't be able to sneak out of the fort through the front gate anymore,\" Illuna says. \"I don't think it's a good idea to fight all of these ogres head on. Luckily for us, the room we are in right now isn't marked in any of the building plans, so most patrols aren't very likely to come searching for us here.

They'll be forced to reveal themselves once the fight begins. Arraka's right.

My followers are going to turn you all into ashes.\"<br/><br/>He then raises his staff in the air, and the five other ogres step in front of him, casting fireballs in unison at us. Hadrik and Daren both step in front as well, in order to form our first line of defense. The dwarf focuses his aura in his fists, and he sends two of the fireballs right back at the ogres. Daren places his sword in front of him, absorbing the other three fireballs within it. He then slashes his flaming sword towards the ogres, and sends a powerful fire beam at them, which burns them into a crisp.<br/><br/> \"You've done it now...\" the shaman says, with a dark look in his eyes, as he looks at the ashes of his five followers. \"I didn't plan to use this on you, but you leave me no choice.\"<br/>He then smacks his staff into the ground, and the whole room gets filled with a thick gray fog. As the fog clears a bit, I realize that we are no longer standing in the middle of a cavern, but on an open plain, and it appears to be... snowing?<br/><br/>My eyes are not deceiving me.

We're not in the real world anymore, and thus, there are different rules. We're not missing only our magical senses, but also our magical powers. You were already wearing collars, so you can't tell the difference, but Arraka and I cannot cast any spells at this moment. Also, it would appear that ranged weapons are not allowed either, since Barry's crossbow is gone.

Does the shaman plan to kill us while we're trapped in here?\"<br/>\"No,\" Illuna says. \"Shaman rituals are different from other mind affecting spells. First of all, time flows differently in this place. A year spent in this world amounts to only one second in the real world. Secondly, the shaman is also trapped in here with us.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what's the purpose, then?\" Hadrik says. \"Isn't this like some sort of dream? Aren't we just going to wake up once we die?\"<br/><br/>\"You may not be familiar with these types of spells, since they aren't all that common on the other continents,\" Illuna says, \"but this isn't anything like a dream. You can feel pain, you can concentrate without waking up, and if you die in here, you die in the real world as well. What's actually happening is that our souls from the ethereal plane are no longer directly connected to the earthen plane, but to another pocket universe from the ethereal plane. In order to reattach our souls to our bodies, we'd need to close our eyes, think about the last moments before we were transported here, get a clear image of those caverns into our heads and then focus on it, with the conviction that the image in our heads represents the real world, while the world we are standing in is only an illusion. The image in our heads would then slowly start to become more vivid, until it would eventually replace the world in front of our eyes.\"<br/><br/>\"And in order to get out of here, we would all need to do that?\" Daren asks. \"Including the shaman?\"<br/><br/> \"Exactly,\" Illuna says. \"Our problem is the shaman. Until we get rid of him, we won't be able to return to the real world. That's why he trapped himself in here with us.\"<br/>\"How are we supposed to fight him if he's got complete control of this world?\" Hadrik says. \"Wouldn't it be like fighting some sort of god?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Illuna says. \"The shaman does not have any control over this world. He only created it. Once he trapped himself in here, he became forced to follow the same rules as the rest of us. That is the nature of these shaman rituals. He doesn't have any magic either, except for the spells in his staff. And since he's been gracious enough to let us finish our conversation, I would suspect that he has no intention of fighting us head on. He must be waiting for something.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " As the fog disappears completely, we see that there are several pairs of red eyes shining in the dark depths of the forest, and we start to hear several low continuous growls as the creatures are getting closer. When they come out of the woods, we learn that they are in fact wolves, though they are at least three times the size of normal ones, and their fur is as black as coal.<br/>Five of them start running towards our group, while Daren and Hadrik step in front of us and assume their battle stances. Three of the wolves go right for them, but the other two circle around and go for Kate and Illuna instead. Daren defended himself with his shield from one wolf, while he sliced the other's head clean off. Hadrik punched the third wolf in its mouth and sent three of its fangs flying, as the animal squealed in pain.<br/><br/>Kate was waiting for the beast with her dagger in hand. The animal dashed towards her, but she managed to get behind it in the blink of an eye, and she slit its throat with a single motion, as her hands got drenched in the wolf's blood. The look in her eyes changed completely when she started fighting the wolf. She's always had a sort of feral look about her, but this was more than that. This wasn't her just being ruthless or efficient. Those were the eyes of a beast hunting its prey. This must be why she was able to survive alone in a jungle at the age of twelve, before she even had any magic. In order to avoid being hunted, she was forced to become the hunter instead.<br/><br/> Illuna, who didn't have any weapons, started jumping around using Flower's acrobatic techniques, in order to confuse the wolf and avoid getting bitten. Once Daren and Hadrik finished dealing with their own wolves, they came and killed the one attacking Illuna as well.<br/>\"This is why the shaman didn't take any actions,\" Hadrik says. \"He was too busy getting away from here, so that his own wolves wouldn't attack him. Luckily for us, he left a trail of footsteps in the snow that we can easily follow.\"<br/><br/>He then points towards the trail of footsteps left by the shaman, which leads into the only part of the forest which doesn't seem to be crawling with wolves.<br/><br/>\"If we all go after the shaman now, we'll have to fight wolves every step of the way,\" Daren says. \"That would only make it easier for him to finish us off. Someone should go after the shaman alone, while the rest of us provide a distraction. Preferably someone who is confident that he can defeat the shaman in a duel and who can handle himself against a few wolves, in case they don't all take the bait.\"   <br/><br/>",

Four of the other wolves have already started chasing Illuna, who is avoiding them to the best of her ability.

When she gets close enough, she dashes to her right, in order to confuse the animals, and then she runs her knife through one of the wolves' heads. After pulling out her dagger from the beast's skull, she rushes towards the other and kills it as well, with a swift strike of her blade. The third wolf manages to hurt Kate's right leg with one of its claws, but it gets killed as well, soon afterwards. Kate then quickly rips off one of her blouse's sleeves and she uses it to tie it around her thigh in order to stop the bleeding.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the whole world starts spinning around me, and then I soon find myself standing in the middle of a cave again, with all of my friends besides me. They also seem to have just woken up, because they are now looking around themselves to confirm that we are indeed back in the abandoned mines below the ogre fort. <br/><br/>At last, the illusion is broken! Hadrik must have found the shaman and forced him to cancel his spell!<br/><br/> Before I get the time to fully regain my senses, a bright green light envelops Illuna, and then it disappears almost as quickly as it appeared. The shaman then starts laughing hoarsely, before coughing some blood on the cave's floor.<br/>\"This is the end, banshee,\" the shaman says, as he coughs some more. \"For both of us. That spell I just cast on you was a curse of death. A shamanic spell that kills both the caster and its target. You likely have less than an hour left to live. My life was forfeited the moment I managed to get myself cornered within my own shaman ritual, but at least now I'll get the satisfaction of dragging the traitor who started all of this mess to the underworld with me!\"<br/><br/>He then laughs hoarsely again, and he starts to turn into ashes.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Hadrik says, as he jumps towards the shaman, but all he gets to punch are his ashes, which are now slowly piling up on the floor of the caverns.<br/><br/>Illuna was in a brief state of shock after the shaman's reveal, but then her expression darkened, and she went to sit herself down on the floor, with her back leaning against one of the cave's walls.<br/><br/>\"What are you waiting for?\" she asks, when she sees us looking at her. \"Get going. I'll hold the ogres off here. It's not like there's much else I can do in the little time I have left.\"<br/><br/>\"It's true, then?\" Rose asks. \"What the ogre said?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"The curse is much too powerful for me to break with any of the spells I know. The shaman was being generous when he said that I'd get to live for another hour. From what I can tell, the curse will likely kill me in the next fifteen minutes.\"<br/>\"No!\" Rose shouts. \"You can't give up! You can't give up like this! There has to be a way to--\"<br/><br/>Rose stops mid-sentence because she sees Daren starting to move towards Illuna. When he reaches her, he lifts his sword and looks at the banshee, without uttering a word. Illuna looks back at him and she laughs.<br/><br/>",

It's only natural that my sword can do something as trivial as dispelling an ordinary death curse, without requiring me to use magic. This makes us even. You saved my life and I saved yours. Now we can move on with our lives and never speak of these events ever again.\"<br/><br/>\"...Agreed,\" Illuna says, after a while, and she uses her healing magic to patch up her wound.<br/><br/>\"Illuna, thank the gods!!!\" Rose says, as she comes to give her a big hug. \"You're going to be okay now, right? There are no other curses?\"<br/><br/>\"No...\" Illuna says, looking a little flustered. \"No other curses as far as I can tell. There's still the matter of the hordes of ogres approaching us, though...\"<br/><br/> \"No need to worry about that!\" Hadrik says, with a grin. \"I've got a plan. But first, we all need to get out of the caves. Come on! Move, move, move!\"<br/>As we all get out of the abandoned mines, Hadrik jumps high into the air, and he punches the rocks above the cave's entrance. The whole rocky wall crumbles and completely blocks the path that leads to the caverns.<br/><br/>\"That's it?\" Daren asks. \"That's your plan?\"<br/><br/>\"Simple, but effective, don't you think?\" Hadrik says, with a wide grin.<br/><br/>\"Did it cross your mind that they might have warriors within their ranks that are capable of moving a few rocks out of their way?\" Daren says. \"Not to mention all the mages that can just blow the rocks up.\"<br/><br/>\"If they try to use explosions, they'll just bury themselves in,\" Illuna says. \"And from what I've seen while I was walking around the fort, the captain was their only warrior that had strength comparable to the dwarf's. They can still use air magic to move the rocks out of the way, but it will take them a while. That gives us more than enough time to make ourselves scarce.\"<br/><br/>\"There you have it!\" Hadrik says. \"Come on, let's go get our backpacks!\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" Arraka says. \"I'm sensing two ogres hiding invisibly near the base of the hill.\"<br/><br/>\"Are they in our way?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"No, but they might try to ambush us later,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>",

You only need a little guidance to learn the basics. For instance, a good starting point would be to practice calming the flow of your aura first. Here, let me show you how it's done.\"<br/><br/>Illuna spent the next two hours teaching Kate how to suppress her aura, step by step, while we kept marching towards the ruins. By the time she was done, I could see that they'd made enormous progress. Kate's magical aura was barely noticeable when she suppressed it now, and you could very well confuse her with a normal human if you didn't examine her closely. The lessons Illuna provided were interesting enough that even Hadrik and I joined in mid-way, and we both spent more than half an hour doing various exercises suggested by her to help us hide our auras from enemies.<br/><br/> Once we found a good camping spot, we started to set up our tents. Hadrik said that two of his spare tents needed to be fixed before they could be used again, so Rose offered to share her tent with Kate and Illuna for the night. When we started discussing about how to divide guard duty between ourselves, Kate, Rose and Hadrik unanimously voted for me and Daren to take the first shift. Their flawless synchronization when they voted for us was suspicious to say the least, but I decided not to call them out on it for the time being.  <br/>Before we went to sleep, Hadrik insisted that we hold a toast to celebrate our victory, but nobody seemed to be in the mood for drinking, given how tired they were after today's events.<br/><br/>",

Most of these troublemakers have been dealt with by our own warriors, but they usually get to do a lot of damage before they're caught, and it's not like the lives they've taken can just be brought back again.\"<br/><br/>He pauses a bit to take a drink from his bottle.<br/><br/>\"But enough about politics,\" he says. \"We should be discussing more important matters. Like for example, what's going on between you and Rose? Is it just me, or have you two been getting a little closer in these past two days?\"<br/><br/>",

I think she's afraid that Daren will kill her in her sleep if he sees her vulnerable, and she no longer has Flower to protect her while she's not awake. She probably only continued to travel with us because she would be in much more danger alone than in a group, considering all of the powerful mages roaming around the continent right now and the fact that she is too tired to keep suppressing her aura until tomorrow.\"<br/>\"So you want me to keep Daren busy while you and Kate try to convince her to take a nap?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's why I persuaded Hadrik to say that two of his tents are unusable, so that Kate and I could sleep in the same tent as Illuna. I think we can get her to fall asleep if we promise that Kate will keep an eye on Arraka's amulet to see if she tries to escape again.\"<br/><br/>I sigh.<br/><br/>\"I know that Daren isn't always the sharpest tool in the shed,\" I say, \"but I think you're underestimating him a little. I would be surprised if he didn't already figure out your plan...\"<br/><br/> \"I don't care if he did or did not figure out my plan,\" Rose says. \"What I want is for him to stay away from Illuna so that she can finally get a good night's sleep. I don't think that Daren would try to hurt her while she's unconscious, but keeping him as far away from her as possible is the only way Illuna can feel safe right now. I'm really sorry that I forced you into this, but I'd much rather have you with Daren than Hadrik, and I can't join you because I need to stay by Illuna's side, since I'm probably the only one that she somewhat trusts in our group. But if you don't feel like going through with this, I understand... I'll try and see if Hadrik--\"<br/>\"No, no, that's not what I meant!\" I say. \"Look, here's what we're gonna do. I'll make sure that Daren doesn't come near your tent during our shift, but if he gives any hint of having figured out what you're up to, I'm not going to start making up lies about it. If he asks, I'll tell him the truth.

As for Kate, I'll need some time to think about how I'm going to approach this, but whatever happens, I'm not planning to let things go on like this. Thanks for hearing me out, Barry... I think I'm feeling a little better now.\"<br/><br/>It was a few hours later that Kate and Hadrik came to take over our shift. I asked Kate in private about how things went with Illuna, and she told me that the banshee was a bit reluctant at first, but they managed to get her to fall asleep eventually. They couldn\u2019t convince her to shut off her alarm, though, so she\u2019d keep waking up every hour or so, in order to check up on Arraka, but at least she got enough rest to pull her through the next day. <br/><br/> After a good night\u2019s sleep, we all got up early in the morning, packed our tents, and resumed our journey, aiming to reach the ruins by sundown. Since we knew exactly which way we were headed this time around, we could afford to keep going without stopping to look for every single one of Flower\u2019s markers, which saved us quite a few hours on our way back. <br/>Due to everything that\u2019s happened in the last few days, our group was visibly starting to become a lot more closely knit. Even though I couldn\u2019t say that we all got along perfectly, the fact of having survived through such hardships together by trusting and relying on each other seemed to have developed a certain bond between us. Even Arraka was starting to act more like a member of the group. As a reward for her cooperation yesterday, her locket was left open, so every now and then she would join our conversations by adding her unique commentary, even though most it was either somehow tied to the atrocities she committed during the still winter, or a dark joke of some kind.<br/><br/>Throughout our journey back to the ruins, Daren had tried on multiple occasions to initiate casual conversation with Illuna, but his awkward attempts at trying to make up with her only managed to make her even more suspicious of his motives. Despite his boasting, however, he still didn\u2019t utter a single word to Kate by the time we\u2019d reached our destination.<br/><br/> The fox was quite surprised when she learned that we\u2019d returned with the chalice. I don\u2019t think she was really expecting us to pull it off. However, she kept her word and removed all of our collars upon confirmation that the artifact we\u2019d brought her was indeed the one she was looking for. Since we didn\u2019t really feel like spending any more time than necessary in this place, we waved goodbye to the fox and the leopard, we started heading out of the forbidden forest, and we prayed that we\u2019d never see either of them again for the rest of our lives.<br/><br/>",

I just follow her lead most of the time... At first, I didn't think she would help out this time around, since she was always making sure to keep her distance and not get involved with you guys.

Since the girl had magical energy to spare after her long nap, she offered to conjure for each of us a dish of our own choosing. I wasn't particularly hungry, so I just asked for some lemon cakes. Everyone else went all out, however, and asked for the most extravagant dishes that came to their minds, like manticore ribs seasoned with a variety of spices, or griffin wings coated with honey. Everyone except Kate, that is. Given that she hadn't really had the luxury of ever tasting any food other than the one she'd hunted herself, she simply asked for roasted duck legs and she went to eat by herself on a log a few dozen feet away from our camp.  <br/>After eating my fill of lemon cakes, I went over to Kate's side, to see how she was doing. I caught her staring blankly at one of the trees in front of her, and she didn't even notice me until I placed myself right in front of her.<br/><br/>\"Still thinking about Diane?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>Kate looked a bit taken aback by my straightforwardness, but in the end she decided to answer me honestly.<br/><br/>\"Yes...\" she says. \"She's been on my mind ever since I woke up in those ruins, but I've been trying my best to not let it show, given the situation we were in.\"<br/><br/>\"Here,\" I tell her. \"Have some lemon cakes. I've already eaten my fill!\"<br/><br/>\"Thanks...\" she says, as she accepts my offer.<br/><br/>",

It's just that... lately I haven't really talked to you. Actually, I haven't even spoken a word to you for days.\"<br/><br/>\"Really?\" Kate says, looking genuinely surprised. \"I never noticed.\"<br/><br/>Daren looks like he's about to lose his cool again, but this time he manages to reign in his emotions.<br/><br/>\"I stopped talking to you right after Azarius told us that you were an artificial mage,\" he says. \"I was just so convinced that you were a banshee from the very beginning, and after I heard what he said I...\" <br/><br/>He pauses.<br/><br/> \"I was wrong,\" he says, after a while, deciding not to continue his previous sentence. \"Even if on the surface I was acting like your friend, in reality I never let my guard down around you, and I was expecting you to betray us and turn into a monster at any moment. And to make matters worse, after learning the truth, instead of trying to make amends, I spent my time sulking like some four-year-old who'd dropped his candy bar in a sewer. I realize that it is way beyond late now, but I couldn't just let things go on like this forever. The reason why I came here to you tonight is that I wanted to... apologize.\"<br/>It looked like it took every ounce of his strength to utter that last word. I don't think I've seen him this tense even when we were battling the hydra in the lessathi ruins.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" Kate says. \"You'll have to repeat that last word you said, because I could barely hear it.\"<br/><br/>\"Damn it, woman!\" Daren says. \"You know very well what I said. Don't make me repeat it! Now, do you accept my apology or not?!\"<br/><br/>Immediately after Daren finishes his sentence, Kate starts to laugh. But her laughter is sounding much more natural than ever before. When he first heard her, Daren looked as if he were about to blow his fuse again, but then he realized that there was no hint of malice in Kate's laughter, so he eventually calmed down.<br/><br/> \"I'm sorry,\" Kate says, as she struggles to contain her laughter. \"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to mock you. It's just that I didn't think that this would be the kind of thing that could trouble you so much. Of course I accept your apology! I was being honest when I said that I never noticed you ignoring me all this time. The two of us never really talked all that much, so none of this seemed strange to me. But I really appreciate you coming out to me like this. Thank you! This made me feel a lot better!\"<br/>She smiles.<br/><br/>\"I'm not sure what this is all about,\" we hear Hadrik's voice coming from behind Daren, \"but I'm willing to bet that this would be the best moment to finally hold that victory celebration!\"<br/><br/>He then places five bottles of dwarven ale on the ground and grins at us.<br/><br/>",

What if we are attacked by some mages or monsters after we have our little party? Who's going to defend us from our enemies if we're all plastered?\"<br/><br/>\"There's no need to worry about that!\" Rose says, as she approaches us, holding a small pouch in her left hand. \"These leaves I have in my bag are a natural remedy for drunken stupors. You just need to chew on them for half a minute, and all dizziness will be gone in a flash, without even having to worry about a hangover afterwards!\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect!\" the dwarf says. \"Then there's no need for us to hold back! I'll go bring more bottles!\"<br/><br/>\"Ooooh, is that dwarven ale?\" Flower says, as she sees the five bottles lying on the ground. \"I've always wanted to try dwarven ale!\"<br/><br/>\"No ale for you, young lady,\" Hadrik says. \"Little kids should not be drinking alcoholic beverages of any kind. It's not good for you.\"<br/><br/>\"But I'm not a little kid!\" Flower says. \"I'm thirty years old!\"<br/><br/>\"You may be thirty years old, but your alcohol tolerance is that of a nine year old,\" Illuna says. \"You can barely even stand on your feet after drinking a glass of wine.\"<br/><br/> \"Petal, you're not helping!\" Flower says, as the rest of us start to laugh. \"You're not helping at all!\"<br/>After the long overdue celebration was finally over, we each went to sleep in our respective tents, except for Hadrik and Daren, who took the first shift. For those few hours while we drank together, it felt hard to believe that we'd been risking our lives fighting ogres just one day prior. It almost felt like I was back at home, spending a night out in a tavern with some friends, far away from all the madness of this tournament. It was nice to have a night like this for a change. And who knows? Maybe the worst is all behind us, and every night from now on will be like this as well. A man is allowed to dream, right?<br/><br/>With these final thoughts, I put my head on the pillow, and I awoke the next morning, feeling completely refreshed. This time around I got the lucky draw, and I didn't need to take any shifts, which was a nice change of pace from all the sleepless nights I've been having lately. Since we didn't have a fixed time limit anymore, we all decided to sleep in today, so it was already ten o'clock in the morning by the time I got out of my tent. Taking a look around the camp, it seemed that everyone else had already gotten up for some time, and they were just about to finish their breakfast.<br/><br/>\"He awakens at last!\" Daren says, as he sees me get out of my tent. \"Did you enjoy your ten hours of uninterrupted sleep, Barry? It's too bad you missed breakfast, though. Flower really outdid herself this time, too! Her food making skills are simply divine. But don't worry, I'm sure we can still scrounge up some cold leftovers for you to eat if you're really hungry!\"<br/><br/>",

Who would be crazy enough to not want you in their group?\"<br/><br/>\"Nobody here would ever turn you away after how much you've helped us, Flower,\" Rose says. \"And don't you even for a second think that you could ever be a bother to us. The question here is what YOU want to do. Would you like to keep travelling with us?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Flower says, beaming. \"I would love to!\"<br/><br/>",

What if I told you that I am deeply unsatisfied with this group's abysmal kill per hour ratio and that I'd only consider continuing our collaboration if you promise to work on improving it, huh? What then?\"<br/><br/>We all stare at Arraka's amulet for a few seconds, until Hadrik decides to break the silence.<br/><br/>\"Alright, then!\" he says. \"It's time for us to start dismantling our tents. Meet you all back here in thirty minutes!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey!\" Arraka says, as we all start heading towards our tents. \"HEY! Don't you dare ignore me! Do you hear me? Come back here! I'm not done complaining yet!\"<br/><br/>It took me a while, but after I got done with my tent and my backpack, I headed back towards our meeting spot, where everyone except Kate seemed to have already arrived. As I got closer, I saw that Flower was currently spinning Arraka's amulet by the chain with a displeased expression on her face.<br/><br/> \"This chain is starting to get old,\" she says. \"We'll have to get a new one the next time we're in a city.\"<br/>\"That's great!\" Arraka shouts. \"Now, if you're done testing the chain's durability, maybe you could STOP WITH THE SPINNING?!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh right, sorry,\" Flower says, as she grabs the amulet and puts it back around her neck. \"I forgot you had motion sickness.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, seriously?\" Hadrik asks, with a laugh. \"The almighty invincible banshee can't handle a little spinning?\"<br/><br/>\"It's because she's trapped in the amulet,\" Illuna says. \"It's messing with her senses. She didn't have any problems like this when she was possessing animal bodies.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh good, Kate's here,\" Daren says, as he sees Kate approaching us. \"I guess we should be good to go, then.\"<br/><br/>\"Where are we headed, exactly?\" Hadrik asks.<br/><br/>\"The city of Thilias,\" Rose says. \"It's a small harbor town near the southern coast. It's lovely this time of year!\"<br/><br/>",

I forgot to wash the plates.\"<br/><br/>\"Who cares about the plates?\" Daren asks. \"Can't you just conjure new ones out of nowhere like you do with the food?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, but it would be a waste to just leave them here,\" Flower says. \"They sell for a pretty good price on the market. This won't take long, I promise. I'll just pick them up quick and wash them in the river. I'll be right back!\"<br/><br/>\"You know, I've always wondered about something,\" Hadrik tells Daren, as Flower rushes past him. \"If they call you guys white mages, then shouldn't necromancers be called black mages? You know, to keep the theme going?\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, that's a common misconception,\" Daren says. \"This has nothing to do with warriors of the light fighting the forces of darkness. The only reason why white mages are called like that is because of the bright light that appears when they cast most of their spells. It's not really an official name, but I guess it kind of stuck. Some white mages with a stick up their arse sometimes even get offended when they're called like that, and they--\"<br/><br/>Daren stopped talking, because a familiar figure had just appeared out of thin air in front of him. A boy with his eyes closed, his hands in his pockets and a polite smile on his face.<br/><br/>\"Greetings, friends!\" Eiden says. \"I come bearing news!\"<br/><br/> \"Eiden...\" Daren says, with a frown. <br/>\"Now, now,\" Eiden says. \"There's no need to be so hostile! I only came to help!\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, how did you find us?\" I ask him.<br/><br/>\"By tracing your auras, of course!\" Eiden says. \"I just finished my business on the other side of the island, and I thought I'd pop by to visit.\"<br/><br/>\"How could you possibly have identified us just by our auras from that far away?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Our auras are much more complex than you may think, Barry,\" Eiden says. \"Most people only use them to learn of a person's magical prowess, and maybe to understand their basic emotional state, but a person's aura is capable of showing us much more than that. With enough practice, you will see that each person's aura is unique, and it can be used to track them down from a great distance, if your magical sense is sharp enough. Mine happens to cover the whole island of Varathia.\"<br/><br/>\"You mean to say that you can find out any person's whereabouts at any given time?\" I say.<br/><br/> \"Yes, but like I said, auras can be used for many other things,\" Eiden says. \"For example, if you study a person's aura fluctuations carefully enough, you can tell if they're lying or not. Besides that, you can also find out their age, their race and their mental state. If you tamper with a person's aura enough, you can even stop them from aging! Speaking of auras, Barry, I happened to see your aura in very close proximity to two lessathi a few days ago. Did you remember to give them my message?\"<br/>Crap, he's talking about the two lessathi that were with Diane. His stupid message was the last thing on my mind at the time. What am I supposed to tell him now?<br/><br/>",

This can't be happening... We were finally rid of the collars. We were rid of them! Everything was going to be okay. Why did you have to come back? Why?!<br/><br/>\"Time is running out, Barry,\" Eiden says. \"Your friend is at the end of her rope. How are you going to stop me?\"<br/><br/>How AM I going to stop him? I still have no idea how he powered up my stat device when I fought the dragon, and I don't know any of his weaknesses. Does he even have weaknesses? Are there any words that can get me out of this like last time? What would make him let her go? What would convince him to let this slide? What am I supposed to do?!<br/><br/>All of a sudden, there's a loud noise of plates shattering to our right, and Rose finally manages to take a deep long breath, as both Eiden and I turn to identify the source of the sound.<br/><br/>Flower is just standing there, with an expression of pure shock on her face, and with a dozen shattered plates lying at her feet.<br/><br/>\"Well, if it isn't Illuna, of the sacred woods massacre!\" Eiden says, smiling. \"It's been twenty years, I believe? How have you been?\"<br/><br/>Flower's expression quickly changes into one of pure rage, as her eyes turn bright red, and her aura starts to fluctuate violently. <br/><br/> \"You!\" she shouts, as she points at Eiden. \"I'll kill you! I'll kill you!!!\"<br/>She then jumps towards Eiden and starts throwing a flurry of fireballs at him, as the stillwater casually dodges each one of them without even using any magic. Flower then shoots a beam of fire that engulfs Eiden completely, but it simply passes him by and leaves him unharmed. <br/><br/>\"You killed them!\" Flower says. \"You killed them all! Bring them back! Do you hear me?! Bring them back!\"<br/><br/>She then conjures a dragon made entirely of fire that flies towards Eiden and starts to attack him with its claws. Flower also joins the battle up close, and she tries to punch the stillwater with her flaming fists.<br/><br/>\"Illuna,\" Eiden says, as he parries the girl's strikes with one hand, and the dragon's with the other. \"Do you think you can put a stop to this? I'm kind of starting to lose my patience, here...\"<br/><br/>For a second, the girl's eyes turned bright blue, and I could clearly see the fear in them. The next moment, Flower stopped moving, and she looked as if she were being held against her will by an invisible force.<br/><br/>\"Let me go, Petal!\" the girl says, as tears start to form in her eyes while she struggles to break free. \"Let me go! I have to kill him! I have to!\"<br/><br/>After trying in vain to free herself for a few more seconds, Flower then turns towards us.<br/><br/> \"It's him!\" she tells us. \"Don't you see? He's the one! He's the one who destroyed the city of Olmnar!\"<br/>",
