I mean, it's been six hundred years, right? No one would blame you if you were to make a confusion after all this time!\"<br/><br/>\"Damn it, this is the third time you've asked me this exact same question,\" Arraka says. \"Yes, it's the same Eiden from six hundred years ago. Get it through your thick skull, already!\"<br/><br/>\"Daren, why are you finding this so hard to believe?\" Kate says. \"We already knew that he was six hundred years old and that he was an old acquaintance of Arraka and the golden fox. Given his power, it wasn't that big of a stretch to assume that he was the one who defeated Arraka all that time ago.\"<br/><br/>\"It's not the fact that he could beat Arraka that I find hard to believe,\" Daren says. \"It's the fact that he is known as the founder of this continent's civilization when all we've seen him do so far is wreak havoc, for the sole purpose of his amusement!\"<br/><br/>\"People change over time,\" Kate says. \"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Eiden tell you when you first met that the reason he is keeping his eyes closed is because he got tired of seeing the ugliness of humanity? You've seen the way he acted around the earl and the ambassador of Ollendor. It's clear that he no longer holds anything other than disgust and disdain for the inhabitants of Varathia.\"<br/><br/> \"Leaving Eiden aside,\" I say, \"shouldn't we rather be discussing our plans for the arena?\"<br/>\"Don't worry about the arena!\" Hadrik says. \"I alone should be more than enough to deal with whatever the ambassador can throw at us!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yeah?\" I say. \"And what if they separate us?\"<br/><br/>\"Barry makes a good point,\" Daren says. \"The first thing we need to make sure of is that we can still communicate with each other, even if they decide to throw us in different cells.\"<br/><br/>Daren takes off his backpack, and then he takes three transceivers out of it.<br/><br/>\"Kate, Hadrik, Flower, take these,\" he says, as he gives each one of them a transceiver. \"Barry, you already have a transceiver. I don't think I've shown you this before, but you have a dial on the right side of your transceiver that you can use to change your calling frequency, in order to match the signature frequency of one of the other transceivers. Does everyone see the dial I'm talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" we all answer.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Daren says. \"Each of the transceivers is assigned a number, which corresponds to its own unique signature frequency. Make sure you memorize everyone else's number so you'll know who to contact, when the need arises. The numbers are engraved on the back of the transceivers.\"<br/><br/> I look at the back of my transceiver and see that I am assigned the number 'two'. When we exchange our numbers, I learn that Kate was number three, Flower was four, and Hadrik was five.<br/>\"Alright,\" Daren says. \"Now you all know your numbers. As an aside, if you ever need to communicate with transceivers that weren't enchanted by me, there's a small button next to the dial which you can use to switch to normal frequencies. I'll be using the transceiver with the number 'six'.\"<br/><br/>\"What about number 'one'?\" I ask.<br/><br/>",

With daggers, it's different, because the quality of the metal is much more important than the way the blade was made.\"<br/><br/>\"Why do you keep talking about basic enchantments?\" Hadrik says. \"Aren't you supposed to be one of the most skilled enchanters in the world? Why don't you just cast some of those crazy enchantments you have on your sword on Barry and Kate's daggers?\"<br/><br/>Daren frowns at him.<br/><br/>\"The more advanced the enchantment, the more time and resources it requires,\" he says. \"It would take me weeks to cast the enchantments I used on my sword, and it would cost a small fortune to acquire the needed materials. I doubt that I'll be doing anything other than basic enchantments for the duration of this tournament. Barry, Kate, give me your daggers. I will enchant them both as soon as we reach that shop.\"<br/><br/>Once he found the shop, Daren went in, and he didn't come out until exactly half an hour had passed. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch2_tell_servant || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_ch11_saved_rose || 0) == 1) {%> During this time, I used my transceiver to contact Rose, and to tell her that we wouldn't make it home in time for dinner tonight.

Why don't you explain it to me?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I'll explain it to you,\" the man says, grinding his teeth. \"Your little stunt with that noble has sealed all of our fates. I heard the guards saying that the next arena event will be the greatest in all the history of Varathia. They're not expecting any of us to make it out alive. They are sending us all to our deaths, just to make sure that they also kill you in the process.\"<br/><br/>The man is now clenching his fist so hard that blood is starting to drip out of it. While the two of us were talking, the doors leading to the individual cells were opening one by one, and people who had been woken up by the sound of the bulky man's voice were now stepping out of their rooms, to watch the show.<br/><br/>\"The only reason why I came to Thilias,\" the bulky man says, \"was because I heard the gnome king would rarely let the arena events in his city endanger the lives of the gladiators. I came here because I thought there was some easy money to be made. But now?... Now I'm just sitting here, waiting for my execution. Cursing my fate. Cursing you!\"<br/><br/> \"Why don't you just leave, then?\" I say.<br/>\"You think I didn't try?!\" the man shouts, even louder than before. \"The owner of the arena isn't letting any of us go. It's the first time in years when he's being allowed to make the show as deadly as he wants. Do you know that he's been collecting rare beasts and keeping them in the underground tunnels for the past ten years, waiting for a chance to parade them in front of an audience? Well, now that he's finally been given permission, the man is planning to make us fight every single one of them! He wants to make this the crowning moment of his career. He doesn't care about what the king of Thilias will do to him if he goes overboard. As long as this one show is successful, he may as well die, for all he cares, and so can we.\"<br/><br/>\"Get a hold of yourself,\" I tell him. \"You're acting as if we're being sent to the gallows, not to a gladiatorial event. I didn't come here to waste time, wallowing in self-pity. I came here to win.\"<br/><br/>After hearing what I had to say, the bulky man completely loses the little self-control he had left, and he swings his right fist at my face, with full force.<br/><br/>",

The impact from the blow made me feel almost no pain, and it didn't even make me move an inch from my original position. As the bulky man retracts his arm, I look at him with the same disinterested expression in my eyes as the one that the desk worker had when he looked at me.<br/><br/>This makes the man even angrier, and he begins to put more strength behind his punches, but that doesn't help him much. After about twenty seconds of continuously hitting me in both my head and my stomach, during which I never even bothered to block a single one of his strikes, my attacker suddenly steps back, as if he's only just now understood the futility of his actions. The astonishment was clearly visible on his face, as he just stood there and looked at me, without saying anything.<br/><br/>\"Are you done?\" I ask him.<br/><br/>\"Maybe I was wrong about you, stillwater,\" the bulky man says, in a tone suggesting that he's still trying to get over the shock of what he'd just witnessed.<br/><br/>He then puts both his hands on my shoulders, and he looks at me with the hope of a man who had not dared to hope any longer.<br/><br/>\"Maybe you were right!\" he says. \"Maybe we can still win this... as long as we work together!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_toughness || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) >= 2) {%> <br/><br/>I use my left hand to parry his fist, and then I quickly punch him in the stomach, before he gets the chance to launch a second attack. The strength of my blow completely took away the man's breath, and sent him to his knees. After about ten seconds of staring blankly ahead of him and gasping for air, the bulky man finally recovers, and he gets back up on his feet. For another few seconds, the man simply stands there and looks at me, in pure astonishment, without saying anything. <br/><br/>\"Well?\" I say. \"Aren't you going to attack me again?\"<br/><br/>\"Maybe I was wrong about you, stillwater,\" the bulky man says, in a tone suggesting that he's still trying to get over the shock of what he'd just witnessed.<br/><br/>He then puts both his hands on my shoulders, and he looks at me with the hope of a man who had not dared to hope any longer.<br/><br/>\"Maybe you were right!\" he says. \"Maybe we can still win this... as long as we work together!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_toughness || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_combat_technique || 0) >= 2) {%> <br/><br/>I step away from his fist, then I grab his arm, and I twist it behind his back.

I yield!\"<br/><br/>As I release his arm, the man steps back from me, and he tries to regain his composure.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_toughness || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_combat_technique || 0) >= 2) {%> \"Maybe I underestimated you, stillwater,\" he says, as sweat is dripping from his forehead. \"Maybe you can put up a fight even without your magic.

The one who is heading towards me is a man about my age, who is wearing his hair in a ponytail, and who has a way of smiling that reminds me of Eiden. The one that remained by the door, watching me is a girl with long silver hair, who appears to be no older than twenty.<br/><br/>The man with the ponytail stops in front of me and he smiles politely.<br/><br/>\"I see that you were able to hold your own against Bruce even without your magic,\" he says. \"Impressive!

My attacker wastes no time, and he attempts to hit me again, this time with his left fist. I stumble a bit, because I didn't properly regain my footing after dodging his last strike, but I get to avoid his next blow just the same. For the next half of a minute, the bulky man unleashes a flurry of punches upon me, in the attempt to catch me off guard at least once. However, even if at certain points it seemed as if I was about to slip up, I always somehow managed to regain my balance and to miraculously avoid getting hit, even if it might have seemed impossible for anyone watching the fight. <br/><br/>After he realizes that he isn't getting anywhere, the bulky man stops attacking me, and he just stands there watching me for a few seconds. <br/><br/>\"Now I understand where your confidence is coming from,\" he says, in disgust. \"I see that you can handle yourself pretty well, even without your magic. But don't make the mistake of thinking that you can just avoid fighting forever.

        "text": " I suddenly realize that the girl with the silver hair was staring at me again. In fact, I think she's been staring at me for a long time. Wilhelm notices me looking towards the girl, and he gives me a smirk.<br/>\"I wouldn't waste my time trying to talk to that one,\" Wilhelm says. \"We've all tried, but she wouldn't say a word. I think that our little silver haired princess is either mute, or she's taken a vow of silence of some sort. Either way, I doubt that you'll get anything out of her.\"<br/><br/>He then bows politely, and he goes back towards his corner of the room. As Wilhelm walks past the girl on his way back, she pays him no mind, and she keeps looking directly at me.<br/><br/>Okay, now I'm certain that she's doing it on purpose. But what does she want from me? Does she want me to go talk to her? I guess there's only one way to find out.<br/><br/>I calmly start heading towards her, while paying close attention to her reactions. The girl seems unfazed by my decision to approach her, and she keeps looking me in the eyes even after I stop in front of her.<br/><br/> Now that I take a better look at the girl, I see that she is at least one head shorter than me, and that she has a very frail constitution. I can see why Wilhelm would choose to call her a princess. She definitely doesn't look like a fighter. Her clothes, however, are nothing close to what a princess might wear. She is wearing a simple beige blouse, short leggings that seem comfortable to move in, and wooden sandals. Despite her frail looking body, the girl is wearing two knives on her belt, and her arms and legs are full of bruises, which indicates that she's likely been in a fight, shortly before she was incarcerated. <br/>Seeing that the girl has no intention of saying anything, I take it upon myself to initiate a conversation.<br/><br/>\"So, are you going to tell me why you've been staring at me for the past five minutes?\" I ask her, bluntly.<br/><br/>The girl gives me no sign of having heard me, and she keeps looking at me, without any change in her expression.<br/><br/>\"Well?\" I say. \"Aren't you going to say anything?\"<br/><br/>Still no response. Wilhelm was right. This is pointless.<br/><br/>I turn away to leave, but then I suddenly feel something pulling on my sleeve. When I turn back, I see that the girl is now holding me by my shirt's sleeve, and there is a blue colored writing, floating in mid-air, in front of her face. The writing is in the Common language, and it says simply: \"Wait\". <br/><br/> The writing then disappears, and it is replaced by a new text, this time saying: \"Is it true, what they say about you?\"<br/>\"What do you mean?\" I ask, looking at the girl. \"What do they say about me?\"<br/><br/>Just like before, the previous phrase is now being replaced by a new text, which says: \"They say that the reason why you were brought here is because you attacked a noble. Is that true?\"<br/><br/>",

It's a stat device, just like my own.<br/><br/>\"You see, my stat booster is a little special,\" Leila writes. \"Not only does it allow me to transform my thoughts into written words at will, but it also lets me know when there are other stat devices in my area. My father is the one who made these modifications. When you first came in here, I almost bought your stillwater story, but when I saw that you had a stat booster with you, I knew at once that you were a lessathi. There would have been no point in carrying such a device with you, unless you were part of the only race that it was designed to work for.\"<br/><br/>\"But the same goes for you too, doesn't it?\" I ask her, starting to finally understand what is going on. \"Which means that you are also a lessathi.\"<br/><br/>Leila nods.<br/><br/> \"Then how come you are here, in this arena?\" I say. \"I had the impression that lessathi have a higher status than nobility on this continent. Can't your father just pull some strings in order to have you released?\"<br/>Leila looks down at the ground for a few seconds, before her new text appears.<br/><br/>\"My father and I are outcasts,\" she writes. \"We aren't treated the same way as the other lessathi. We've been in hiding for years, but a few months ago my father was sold to a noble, and made into a slave. The reason why I'm here is because they caught me yesterday, shortly after I managed to rescue him.\"<br/><br/>\"I see,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"After they enslaved him, I never thought I'd see him again,\" Leila writes. \"But a week ago, when the tournament began, and I started receiving my first stat points, I finally felt like I had a chance to free him. I waited until I could upgrade my speed, strength and combat technique stats to their maximum level of three, and then I singlehandedly defeated all of the guards holding my father prisoner. I only wish I'd waited until I could invest a little in toughness as well...\"<br/><br/>Leila then shows me the bruises on her arms and legs.<br/><br/> \"After I freed my father,\" Leila continues, \"I made him promise that even if I got captured, he'd go to Ollendor without me, and wait for me there. Ollendor is the only remaining city of Varathia where the lessathi hold no power. In Ollendor, we would be safe from them. But the city's guards caught me before I could get out of the city. I held them off until my father could escape, but I was already weakened from the previous battle, and I couldn't beat them all. In the end, they tied me up and sent me here. I arrived in this cell yesterday in the afternoon, not long before you made your appearance.\"     <br/><br/>",

There are harpies, wargs, wyverns, three headed hounds, mammoths, giant spiders, giant eagles... The list is endless. And let's not forget that each type of creature has its own subcategories that cannot be ignored, because they are sometimes wildly different from each other. You can have red spiders, green spiders, white spotted black spiders and even ten-legged spiders, each of them with their own unique behaviors and weaknesses. <br/>Now that I think about it, Bruce mentioned that the arena's owner was fond of dangerous creatures, but does that mean that he might be keeping monsters of the humanoid type in here as well? Monsters might be treated as if they are all mindless creatures by most people, but the reality is a little different. Monsters of the humanoid variety are generally much more intelligent than the average creature. Some of them are even organized in tribes, and they can communicate advanced information with each other through their own languages, even if most of them don't speak Common. The ogres from the fort were one such example. If they have any monsters here that are as strong as the ogre captain or the shaman, then we might be in for one hell of a fight.<br/><br/>As I sit on my bed and read, I suddenly hear a man's voice coming from my cell's window.<br/><br/>\"Greetings,\" the voice says.<br/><br/> I turn around, to see if I can get a glimpse of the man's face, but he is hiding behind the wall outside my cell.<br/>\"Do I know you?\" I ask him.<br/><br/>\"No,\" the voice says. \"But I heard that there was a fellow lessathi among the prisoners who were brought here yesterday evening, so I came to pay you a visit.\"<br/><br/>\"A fellow lessathi, you say...\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the voice says. \"I am here to offer you a deal. Normally we do not deal with criminals, but since you are a lessathi, I believe that it's only fair to give you a second chance.\"<br/><br/>He pauses.<br/><br/>\"Go on...\" I say.<br/><br/>",

The man who just entered the recreation area is simply radiating magical energy, and he makes no attempt at hiding it. However, he does not appear to be one of the tournament's participants, because I'm seeing a warning sign above his head, telling me not to hurt him. He must be one of the local mages. Judging by the look on his face, it's clear that he didn't come here of his own free will, so he's likely been sent here because he broke the Varathian law in some way. The mage notices me, but he doesn't bother to acknowledge my presence, and he goes directly to his room.<br/><br/>The rest of the day was mostly uneventful, except for a drunk call that I got from Hadrik on the transceiver, who insisted on passing me one of his teammates, because of the funny way in which he impersonated a famous noble from the Western Continent.  <br/><br/>The next morning, I was woken up by the same guard from the previous day, telling me that the recreation period had started.<br/><br/> \"Wakey-wakey!\" the guard says. \"It's recreation time!\"<br/>I open the door to my cell and start heading towards an empty area of the recreation room, just like yesterday. As I walk, I overhear the two thugs from my division talking loudly several feet away from me, and I turn around to see what's going on. It looks like they're talking to Leila, as she is casually leaning with her back against the wall, watching them silently.<br/><br/>\"Hey, princess,\" one of the thugs says. \"How about you take us both to your room, like you did with the stillwater, yesterday?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" the other thug says. \"We have some very important tactical information that we'd like to discuss with you.\"<br/><br/>Leila continues to look at them, without saying anything. The first thug who spoke concludes that he wasn't being intimidating enough, so he now places both his hands on the wall behind her, as he leans closer to her face.<br/><br/>",

So you'd better wise up and do what I say, or else I'm going to hurt you so bad, that you'll wish you--\"<br/>The thug didn't get to finish his sentence, because Leila decided she's had enough, and she punched him so hard in the stomach that the man fell down and started rolling on the floor from the pain.<br/><br/>\"You bitch!\" the other thug says, as he pulls out his knife, but he doesn't get a chance to use it, because a sudden kick from Leila sends him flying into a nearby wall.<br/><br/>\"By the gods, that was amazing!\" we hear Bruce shout from the other end of the room.<br/><br/>He rushes over to Leila and he grabs her by both her shoulders. Leila looks a bit shocked, but she quickly realizes that there is no ill-intent behind the man's actions, so she doesn't attack him.<br/><br/>\"With strength like that, you could take out a small battalion by yourself!\" Bruce says, enthusiastically. \"How did they even manage to capture you?\"<br/><br/>Suddenly, Bruce realizes that he got carried away too much, and he releases Leila from his grasp.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry,\" Bruce says. \"I know that you don't like to talk. But I just want you to know that I've got your back. Whenever you feel like you're in a pinch in the arena, remember that you can count on me to help. That's all I wanted to say.\"<br/><br/>Leila looks a little confused, but she nods slowly, in acknowledgement of his words. <br/><br/> \"Alright, then,\" Bruce says. \"I'll be over there, if you need me.\"<br/>He then turns away from her, and he goes back to his end of the room.<br/><br/>The thug that got punched in the stomach managed to get back on his feet, and he's now rushing towards his fallen comrade, who still hasn't woken up from his collision with the wall. Eventually, he manages to wake him up, and then they both walk towards their corner of the room, without even daring to glance towards Leila on their way back.<br/><br/>Nothing else happened during the two hour long recreation period. The mage from yesterday isolated himself, just like everyone else, and he hasn't exchanged a single word with anyone. I would have expected Wilhelm to welcome him to the division, like he did with me, but it seems that he didn't consider him worth the bother. <br/><br/>After we return to our cells, I go to sit on my bed, and I open my notebook. Not long after I start reading, I hear three light knocks on my door. <br/><br/>\"Who is it?\" I ask.<br/><br/>There is no answer. A few seconds later, there are three more knocks on the door which are a little louder than the last ones.<br/><br/>",

Almost immediately afterwards, the floor beneath us opens up, and the next thing we know, we're both falling into a pit, while we can see the floor to our room slowly closing itself back up, above our heads. After what seemed like a hundred foot drop, we fall into an underground lake, with a big splash. As I tread water to keep myself afloat, I take a look above me, to see if there's any way we could go back the way we came. <br/><br/>The cavern's walls and ceiling around us seem to be littered with some sort of glowing blue crystals that are providing a fair bit of lighting throughout the area, but I see no obvious way to climb back up to our cell. The only things leading upwards are some ropes that are tied to a pulley which is hanging from the ceiling, but there's no way I could climb all the way up there on some rope.<br/><br/>Suddenly, I can hear the sound of repeated splashing water behind me, and as I turn to look, I see Leila desperately flinging her arms through the water, with her mouth wide open, looking as if she'd forgotten that she couldn't talk and was trying to scream. Realizing what's happening, I quickly swim towards her, and grab her by her shoulders, in order to stop her arms from flailing. <br/><br/> \"Leila, it's okay!\" I tell her, as she's looking at me, terrified. \"Just grab onto me. I'll lead us to shore.\"<br/>It takes her a few moments, but eventually she calms down, and she grabs onto me with both of her arms, holding me very tightly. Once I lead her safely to the shore, we take a break to catch our breaths. We are both soaked to the skin, and the air around here is definitely not as warm as it is on the surface. Ideally, I would make a fire in this situation, but is there any wood to be found in an underground cavern such as this?<br/><br/>My question gets immediately answered as I turn around and see a wooden cabin a few hundred feet from where we're standing. There's also a big pile of logs stacked up right in front of its door. How convenient.<br/><br/>",

I mean, I'm sure that it was designed as a trap originally, but who knows if anyone even remembers that it exists.

They're all coming out of the water, and the way they are distanced from each other makes me think that they are tied to some sort of platform at the bottom of the lake. Possibly an elevator.

It seems that I was right. There really is a platform at the very bottom of the lake, tied to the ropes. However, there is no obvious mechanism that looks like it could be used to operate the elevator, as far as I can see. The only thing that looks like something of the sort is a stone pillar, next to the platform, with a hole at the top, shaped like a spider. If this elevator is requiring some kind of a spider shaped key in order to get activated, then I'm out of luck. After a few more unsuccessful rounds of circling the platform for signs of a lever, I finally run out of breath, and I go back to the surface to get some air in my lungs. This is pointless.

We heard that the lessathi's leadership had changed while we were away, and that their new leader, Meridith, had prohibited the hunts for lessathi outcasts. My father insisted that we move into a city, because then he would have easier access to the parts he needed to work on his devices. At the time, I did not understand why he would want to risk his safety just to work on some devices. I only understood his true purpose a few years later, when he gifted me my stat booster on my 16th birthday. Back then, it could only write a few words, but he's been perfecting it over the years, and eventually, it got to a point where I could put almost all of my thoughts into words by using my device.\"<br/>\"Oh, no,\" I say. \"I just remembered something!\"<br/><br/>\"What?\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"The device!\" I say, as I quickly pull the stat booster out of my pocket. \"I completely forgot about the stat device!\"<br/><br/>I start to shake the stat booster, to make sure that it doesn't have any water in it, and then I test all of the buttons one by one, without locking in any stats, to see if everything still functions properly. When Leila understands what I'm doing, she begins to giggle silently.<br/><br/>\"It will take more than a little water to make these devices stop working,\" Leila writes. \"Don't worry, your stat booster is fine!\"<br/><br/> \"I'm sorry,\" I say, after I've made sure that the stat device still works, \"I shouldn't have interrupted. You were about to tell me how your father got captured?\"<br/>\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"You see, the thing is that even if the hunts for outcasts were prohibited, that did not mean that the old grudges had been forgotten. The lessathi who worked with my father at the Beacon had been meaning to punish him for a long time, but they couldn't do it openly. So what they did, eventually, was that they forged some documents, stating that my father had a huge debt to the owner of our house. They got the owner on their side, and he lied that we never paid our rent since we moved into his home. We didn't have any witnesses on our side, while the lessathi had all the witnesses and the fake documents that they needed to prove my father's guilt. Given that he couldn't pay his debt, my father was sold as a slave, to one of the nobles of Thilias. I escaped before they could sell me too, and I've been living on the outskirts of the city for months, trying to find a way to free him, but it wasn't until the beginning of the tournament that I got a chance to actually do it.\" <br/><br/>As Leila stops talking, I suddenly realize that I've been asking her all these questions, but I never even bothered to tell her that I'm currently travelling with one of her old colleagues from the Beacon. Should I tell her, though? Kate never told me anything about Leila before. She's only mentioned Diane. Was this because she thought Leila was dead, or because she considered her an enemy, for being a lessathi? I'm not sure if I'd want to get this girl's hopes up, in case Kate never wants to see her.<br/><br/>",

There are dire wolves, gargoyles, giant rats, harpies, griffins, and sabre-toothed tigers, all kept in different cells of the same tunnel, and something tells me that this is only a small fraction of the vast array of creatures that the arena's owner has at his disposal.<br/>\"They're not guarded,\" Leila writes. \"I think that they weren't expecting any intruders coming from this direction.

Leila wastes no time, and she throws a second rock at one of the other tigers in the cell. At that moment, we begin to hear a deafening shriek from the harpies in the opposite cell. Harpies are hideous creatures that have the appearance of women with scales, wings and claws. They might look almost human, but in reality, they couldn't be more different. They are just about as intelligent as the lowliest of reptiles, and they're twice as vicious. Their shrieks are most likely meant to alert whoever is in charge of guarding these cells. <br/><br/>Leila quickly changes her targets, and she begins to hit the harpies instead, but now the whole tunnel is being flooded with the roars and screams of all the creatures that are being held in the cells. This isn't good. Someone is bound to hear this noise, and if this someone has a way of opening the cells remotely, we'll be surrounded by these creatures in no time. I look around, to see which of the creatures would be the most dangerous for us to face, if they were freed.<br/><br/> The dire wolves, the giant rats and the sabre-toothed tigers are all deadly, but in the end, they're not much more powerful than regular animals. Leila is already dealing with the harpies, which leaves me to choose between the gargoyles and the griffins. <br/>Griffins are creatures that have the bodies, tails and legs of lions, while their heads, wings, and talons are those of eagles. They can be a nuisance, but their main power lies in attacking from above, which would be difficult to do here, because of the relatively low ceiling. <br/><br/>Gargoyles, on the other hand, also have other means of fighting, besides their aerial attacks. They could accurately be described as thinner ogres, with wings and horns, while their strength is comparable to that of the ogres as well. Even if their wings wouldn't be of much help here, they could still crush our bones with their bare hands if they got close enough to us.    <br/><br/>I decide that the gargoyles are by far the most dangerous of the bunch, so I pick a rock from the ground, and I throw it at one of their heads. <br/><br/>",

I manage to pull off a successful feint, pretending that I'm about to stab this one in the heart as well, but I switch the direction of my stab at the last moment, and I slash the gargoyle's neck open with one swift movement of my dagger.<br/><br/>The last of the gargoyles tries to take me by surprise from behind, but I never took my eye off it during the fight, so I knew exactly when to duck, and when to strike back.

If I remember correctly from what was written in my notes, gargoyles normally tend to wait until they surround their victim, before they make their attack. The one that dashed straight for me must have only done so because I made it angry by hitting it with the rock, earlier. As long as I don't let them surround me, the other two will likely hesitate to attack me, giving me the time to finish off their more hotheaded companion. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_strength || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_combat_technique || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_reflexes || 0) >= 3) {%> I step back, and I make sure that the angry gargoyle follows me.

As I had hoped, the other two monsters are still trying to position themselves on opposite sides of me, in order to flank me. I don't give them the time to get into position, and I dash towards one of them, with my dagger at the ready. Its wings are a bigger and easier target to hit, so I step to the side, and slash at its left wing, before I move in for the kill. The gargoyle does not manage to recover from the pain in time, and I finish it off with one swift strike.

It then throws me to the ground in disgust, as my consciousness fades away completely.<br/><br/><% } %>",

And I'm willing to bet that they've been left on the verge of starvation, just so they'd be more aggressive when the arena begins.

One of them makes a run for me, in an attempt to overwhelm my defenses, but distancing itself from its allies was a fatal blunder. Now that I'm no longer afraid of being attacked by the others, I dash to the creature's side, as it approaches me, and I repeatedly stab it in the side of its chest.

The last of the griffins looks a little hesitant now, and it appears that it can't decide whether it wants to retreat or not.

It takes me a few seconds, but I manage to successfully pull it out, and I grab it with both hands, to see how well it could perform as an improvised weapon.

With its length of over eight feet, I should easily be able to keep the griffins at a distance while I bludgeon them repeatedly and smash them into walls.<br/><br/>I initiate the fight by smacking one of the griffins over the head really hard, with the iron bar.

I don't wait for them to get closer, and I swing the iron bar towards the griffin that's closest to me, sending it flying headfirst into a wall. I then use my improvised weapon to strike the front legs of the two remaining griffins in one sweeping motion.

They don't seem comfortable attacking me while I'm standing up, but they don't look like they want to retreat, either. <br/>Their few moments of indecision cost them dearly, because now the griffins have finally taken notice of them, and are running at full speed towards their prey. The first griffin to arrive pounces onto one of the rats and finishes it off with its beak. The rest of the rats are now scattering, but they're not fast enough to escape the griffins. Eventually, each of the four griffins manages to kill at least one of the giant rats, and now they're all busy feasting on their hard earned spoils, completely ignoring the fact that I'm still here.<br/><br/>I couldn't have asked for a better turn of events. The griffins are spread out from each other, and they are completely focused on eating their meals. All I need to do now is kill them off quietly, one by one, and they won't even get the chance to attack me!<br/><br/>As I approach the griffin that's closest to me, with my knife in hand, I can't help but think that this is likely the one and only opportunity I'll ever have to ride a griffin. It's just lying there, not paying any attention to me. All I'd need to do is jump on its back, and I'd be just like one of those griffin riders from the stories I used to read when I was a kid. I mean, they've got griffins locked up in here, so they surely must have tamed them enough for people to ride on their backs, right?<br/><br/> No, no, no! This is stupid! What am I even thinking? Am I trying to get myself killed?<br/>I try to get these thoughts out of my head, as I get closer to the griffin, and prepare to strike. The griffin is lying on its belly, with its front claws holding the dead rat, while using its beak to cut through the meat. It's still ignoring me.<br/><br/>Maybe it wouldn't hurt if I just climbed on its back real quick. It's not like I'm ever going to get another chance like this. And if things go bad, I'll just jump right off, and kill it with my dagger. There's nothing that can go wrong if I just give it one quick try, right?<br/><br/>",

She then takes her two daggers and she throws them into the remaining wolf's and tiger's heads, sending their lifeless bodies tumbling to the cavern's floor.<br/><br/>\"I took care of the griffins and the gargoyles,\" I tell Leila, as she retrieves her two daggers from the wolf and the tiger's bodies. \"There are some rats left, but they're not exactly a threat.

The lances were being wielded not by humans, but by hideous monsters that were the size of humans, only with gray skin, long pointy noses, large fangs, and the appearance of savages. The monsters that were facing us were trolls. <br/>Trolls are not as smart as goblins, but they're definitely smarter than ogres, and what is particularly dangerous about them is the fact that they have incredible regenerative powers. Unless you cut their head clean off or use fire to kill them, they can even grow back a limb if you give them enough time. These are not the kind of enemies that I was hoping to meet here.<br/><br/>\"Throw down your weapons!\" one of the trolls says in the Common language, with what is probably the most broken accent that I've ever heard in my life. <br/><br/>Leila and I exchange a look, but we hold on to our weapons, while the trolls seem to be growing impatient.<br/><br/> \"Throw down your weapons now, or you will be executed on the spot!\" the troll says.<br/>Before we get the chance to answer the trolls, I suddenly hear Flower's voice coming from behind the monsters.<br/><br/>\"Somehow, I had a feeling that you would be the source of all this commotion,\" the voice says.<br/><br/>\"Flower?\" I ask.<br/><br/>As soon as I stop talking, a water whip comes out of nowhere, and it beheads all of the six trolls in a single swipe. After the trolls' bodies fall to the ground, I get a good look at Flower, and I see that her eyes are bright blue.<br/><br/>",
