 "I don't think that teaming up with the king or Peter would be a good idea," I say. "They'll probably both be weaker here than on the earthen plane, and we'll just end up having to defend them throughout the whole battle. We'd be better off on our own."
"Well, if you say so, Barry..." Flower says. "Alright, I'm teleporting us to the Overseer directly, then. Are you ready?"

"Yep," I say, and then we both get enveloped by the usual bright light that appears when you are getting teleported.

"Here we are!" Flower says, once we reach our destination.

When I look around, I see that we're now somewhere in the sea of light called the ether, with the Overseer's green-eyed drone floating about two dozen feet away from us.

"Processing. Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol thanks you for sparing it the effort of looking for you. Could you please state the purpose of your visit so that I may calculate my next few actions accordingly?"

 "Weren't you supposed to be really smart?" I ask the Overseer. "You should be able to figure out the reason why we came here without us telling you."
"Judging by your response, the Overseer protocol is assuming that you have not changed your point of view, and that you are still unwilling to help me in my battle against the rebels," the Overseer says. "Is that correct?"

"How's this for an answer to your question?" I tell him, as I get in a special stance and I make some very fast hand movements while I'm imagining the magical energy building up in my fingertips.

Before the Overseer has the time to say anything else, I point my finger at him and a bolt of lightning shoots out of it, straight for his green eye. The lightning bolt seems to hit the drone at first, but then I realize that the only thing I did was to slightly graze the invisible shield that it had probably already cast around itself before we teleported here.

Following my lead, Flower also commences the attack, by hitting the Overseer with a barrage of fireballs. When the flames from the explosions fade away, I see that the Overseer had managed to create a dome made of stone around himself, which shielded him completely but is now quickly crumbling into tiny pieces of rock.

 "Warning!" the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol will now be activating its new experimental procedures, designed exclusively for the ethereal plane. Please be advised that these new procedures are based upon knowledge from the Magium, and that to this date they remain largely untested. If you have any complaints regarding these new procedures, please refer to section 5C-E789 of the Overseer operating manual."
"Experimental procedures?" I ask, confused. "What the hell is that supposed to--"

Before I get to finish my sentence, a powerful shockwave of pitch-black energy gets released from the Overseer's drone, reaching us in less than a second and disintegrating our bodies almost immediately afterwards. I barely get a few moments to understand what's going on before I lose all of my senses, and then my consciousness fades away completely.

 "Alright," I say. "Let's go to Peter first, then. Can you teleport us there now?"
"I'm on it!" Flower says, as we are both getting enveloped by a bright white light.

"What are you doing here?" I suddenly hear the voice of Peter, once we are done teleporting to our new location, in the middle of the ether.

When I turn to look towards Peter, who was somewhere around ten feet away from us, I see that the king of the underground was also there, like Flower said, and he had already created a body for himself in the ethereal plane. As I get a better look at the two of them, I notice the fact that Peter's eyes are not shining brightly like Flower's, which means that he must not have experienced the same evolution that would allow him to teleport over long distances and to detect souls on the ethereal plane no matter where they are.

"Well, we were about to go deal with the Overseer and thought that you might want to join us," I tell Peter. "What do you say?"

"You want us to go with you after you deliberately told us that you and the Overseer were planning to ambush us?" Peter says. "What kind of fools do you take us for?"

"Come on, Peter," I say. "Use your brain a little. That was obviously a joke. What would be the point of an ambush if I just announced it in advance so brazenly?"

 "You say that you were only joking, but we already know that you've been contacting the Overseer through the blue crystals while we were underground," the king says. "Perhaps you would like to shed some light to us on what may have been your reason for actively communicating with our enemy in secret, right before a major battle?"
He knows about our conversations with the Overseer? Could it be that one of his men overheard us when we were talking about it in the tunnels?

"Look, I'm not going to deny that the Overseer gave us the option to join him, and that we seriously considered accepting his offer for the better part of an afternoon, but we did refuse him in the end," I say. "And it's not like I'm asking you to believe me without proof either. Think about it for a second. If we really wanted to ambush you now, wouldn't it have made more sense to go visit the Overseer first, and then teleport together with him here? Why risk going through all these charades, when there would be a good chance that you wouldn't believe us and attack us on sight?"

"My main takeaway from all of this is that you and your team were on the verge of betraying us, and you somehow decided not to do it, on a whim," the king of the underground says. "If that is truly the case, then what guarantee do we have that you won't simply change your mind in the middle of our battle and switch sides again for no reason?"

 "No reason?..." I tell the king. "You were planning to assassinate us, man! How is that not a good enough reason to consider switching sides? You think we didn't know about your secret plans? The Overseer played a recording for us where you told Albert to deal with us 'discreetly' if we wouldn't agree with you being crowned as the new king of Ollendor. If that is not a direct admission of betrayal, then I don't know what is!"
"Ah, I think I'm finally beginning to understand what is going on," the king of the underground says. "Indeed, if that is what you've heard, then I cannot fault you for your actions. I would have probably interpreted my words in the same way as you, if I were in your place. I realize that it would be pointless by now to tell you that this was all a misunderstanding, so I am instead going to take a leap of faith and trust what you said about you refusing the Overseer's offer. Hopefully, with all this said and done, we can finally put this argument behind us and focus on the more important task of planning our attack against our common foe."

"Well, we were about to go deal with the Overseer and thought that you might want to join us," I tell Peter. "What do you say?"

 "We were actually heading towards him as well," the king of the underground says. "We'd be grateful if you helped transport us there, because Peter has only a limited amount of teleportation spells that he can use per day, and we'd rather not waste them unless it's absolutely necessary."
"Perfect," I say. "We'll take you there right now, then!"

"Hold on a moment," the king says. "Don't you think we should be planning our attack a little before charging in like this?"

 "Planning our attack?" I say. "I was kind of assuming that we'd just teleport over to him and then figure out the rest when we get there. Is there really a plan to make when we don't even know the Overseer's full capabilities in this plane of existence?"
"I wasn't saying that we should anticipate the Overseer's every move," the king of the underground says, "but we should at the very least know what each of us can do before we head into battle. We don't want to risk getting in each other's way by accident before we even begin to fight, do we?"

"I suppose you're right," I say.

"Would you perhaps care to go first?" the king of the underground says. "I'm assuming that there must be some special reason why you are the one accompanying your ethereal friend and not any of the powerful mages in your group, correct?..."

"Oh, yeah," I say. "It turns out that being a mage doesn't really help you to cast magic on this plane of existence unless you're an ethereal or a being from the magical plane. I, on the other hand can cast a fair amount of spells in this plane, thanks to the extensive amount of knowledge in the field of magical theory that I've gained throughout my life, due to my never-ending quest of trying to become a mage."

"Fascinating..." the king of the underground says. "It's not that I don't believe you, but could you perhaps demonstrate a few spells for us so that we can have a general idea of how this works? Do your spells function in the same way as the ones on the earthen plane?"

 "Yes," I say, "they're mostly the same, except for the fact that I need to know the flow of magic and the theory behind each spell perfectly, or they'll fail to cast. Let me give you a few examples."
After I stop talking, I begin to cast one basic spell from each element, to give them a little taste of what I can do. Once I'm done showing off, the king of the underground spends a few moments contemplating on what he's just seen before he speaks again.

"Given the variety of the spells you've just shown us, am I to understand that you are the equivalent of a generalist on this plane?" the king of the underground says. "How many more spells do you know?"

"It's hard to say," I answer him. "There are some spells that I've already tested, so I know that I can cast them here, but for many others it's going to be a gamble. I know the theory behind too many spells to be able to test them all, and I can't be sure that I can cast a spell in this plane successfully before I try it and see how it works. One thing I can tell you for certain is that my stat device will not work here, because I'm not carrying it with me on the ethereal plane, so the only thing I can rely on is my magic. Oh, and I might also be able to use the multi-step dispelling technique that I invented while I was apprenticing under Brinhorn, now that I think about it. That should be simple enough to do even in a place like this."

"Multi-step dispelling..." Peter says, as he is trying to comprehend what I've just said. "You mean the Brinhorn dispelling technique?"

"Yeah, that's the one," I say.

 "What do you mean you invented it?!" Peter snaps, all of a sudden. "Are you insane? Brinhorn was the one who invented it, not you! It's even in the name!"
"Well, yes, he asked me if he could name the technique after himself and I said that I didn't mind," I say. "I've met hundreds of Barrys in my lifetime. There really wouldn't have been much point in naming that technique after me."

"You are delusional," Peter says. "And you expect me to believe that Brinhorn even considered accepting you as an apprentice when you couldn't cast any magic at all? This is beyond ridiculous!"

"Now, now, Peter," the king of the underground says. "I will admit that what he told us is a little hard to believe, but he did just show us that he can cast a wide variety of spells in this realm, so that does lend a bit of credence to his story."

The king now turns towards me.

"Either way," he continues, "I believe that we should now know enough of your capabilities to work around them. Peter is a generalist as well, so I'm sure that the two of you will get along just fine."

 "With all due respect, my king, but calling this person a generalist is an insult to all generalists that have ever existed in our world's history," Peter says. "This man is nothing but a fraud. The fact that he could even dream to compare himself to someone like Brinhorn shows us what little understanding of magical theory he actually has! Brinhorn is someone who has been challenging Azarius for the title of Sage of the West almost every year for as long as I can remember! Who does this 'Barry' think he is to speak that man's name with such ease?"
"You could also say that Brinhorn has been losing against Azarius every year and you'd be just as accurate," I say. "Wouldn't you say that describing him like this would make it a little easier for me to compare myself to him?"

"You insolent son of a--" Peter starts to say, but the king interrupts him.

"That's enough, Peter," the king of the underground says. "Like him or not, we will still be working together with him for the time being, so let's try to at least keep things professional, shall we?"

"...Yes, my lord," Peter says. "As hard as it may be, I will try to abstain myself from making any further comments, at least until the upcoming fight is over."

"Very well," the king says, and then he turns towards me again. "Now, Barry, as you may have already guessed, Peter has always been a great fan of both Azarius and Brinhorn, and he even went to see one of their official duels at one point. You could even say that they've served as his role models, to a certain extent. I believe this should give you a relatively good idea of what his spell repertoire is, correct?"

 "I think so, yeah," I say.
"Fantastic," the king of the underground says. "In that case, Peter, I only have one last question for you, if you don't mind."

"Yes, my king?" Peter says.

"You told me that my earthen body uses its aura to link itself to my soul from the ethereal plane, is that right?" the king says.

"Yes, sir," Peter answers.

"So if the aura is linked to my soul," the king continues, "then it would be logical to assume that my soul also has a separate aura of its own which the earthen aura can link itself with, correct?"

"I... haven't really given it much thought until now," Peter says, "but logically speaking, it should be as you say, yes."

"Good!" the king of the underground says. "So I'm not just imagining things, then!"

He then stretches his arms to his side, while pointing his palms away from him, and an invisible force suddenly pushes Flower, Peter and me back about ten feet.

"It's a bit weaker than on the earthen plane, but it looks like I'll be able to use aura manipulation on this plane of existence as well," the king of the underground says, as he now turns to us. "Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm ready whenever you are. Just say the word and we'll start the battle!"

"Let's do this, then," I say. "Flower, can you take us to the Overseer?"

"Yep!" Flower says. "Here we go!"

 The white light from the teleportation envelops us once again, as our bodies begin to vibrate loudly. A few seconds later we find ourselves in a different location within the ether, with a green-eyed drone floating somewhere around two dozen feet away from us.
"Processing. Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol thanks you for sparing it the effort of looking for you. There is, however, still one last matter that needs to be resolved before I choose my next course of action. Could you please specify the reason why you chose to teleport yourselves here together with the king of the underground and Peter instead of coming alone?"

"Weren't you supposed to be really smart?" I ask the Overseer. "I think you should be able to figure that one out without us telling you."

"Experimental procedures?" I ask, confused. "What the hell is that supposed to--"

Before I get to finish my sentence, a powerful shockwave of pitch-black energy gets released from the Overseer's drone, reaching us in less than a second. Instead of hitting us directly, however, the shockwave gets stopped by an invisible barrier that had been placed some fifty inches ahead of us, most likely by the king of the underground. Due to the force of the impact, we can see several cracks starting to appear in the barrier in front of us, which is gradually becoming less transparent.

 "If this is how much damage that wave of energy did to my barrier, then it would have certainly obliterated us in an instant if it ever reached us," the king of the underground says. "I don't want to alarm anyone, but I doubt I'll be able to defend us against more than... four of these types of attacks, at most, before my semi-transparent aura shield cracks. And once that happens, I will need a significant amount of time to prepare another one."
"The Overseer protocol apologizes for the inconvenience it has caused," the green-eyed drone says, as it sends another powerful shockwave towards us that creates additional cracks in the king's semi-transparent barrier, while the drone itself is pulsating loudly, making a very strange noise. "The experimental procedures are currently not working as intended. Please be patient while we try to resolve this issue."

 "We can't just wait here until the barrier breaks," I say. "We'll have a much better chance if we all attack him together."

"Agreed," I say.

"Prepare your spells," the king of the underground tells us. "I will dismiss my barrier soon."

We do as he says, and then we wait for the Overseer to hit us with his next shockwave. Immediately after that happens, the king cancels his barrier and then we begin to assault the green-eyed drone with every long range spell we can think of, while the king of the underground is also using his aura manipulation to put some more pressure on our enemy.

 As we are still busy casting our offensive spells, the Overseer releases another deadly shockwave without any warning, but this time the king does not manage to create a barrier fast enough. When the wave of energy reaches us, it disintegrates our bodies almost immediately, and I barely get a few moments to understand what's going on before I lose my consciousness completely.

 "I think it might be a good idea to keep that barrier active a little longer," I say, in a low voice. "The Overseer doesn't look like he's done with his shockwaves yet. But if you feel like your shield is about to break, then tell us, and we'll make sure to attack the drone all at once."
"Sounds like a reasonable plan," the king of the underground says. "However, you should all make sure to have your spells prepared in the meantime, so that you can fire your projectiles at a moment's notice."

"Gotcha," I say, as I begin to prepare one of my spells.

Just like the king of the underground said, his barrier is able to withstand the next two shockwaves without failing, but the cracks are now much too large to ignore. It feels like his invisible shield is ready to give out at any minute. Just as I was about to ask him how much longer he will be able to keep this up, the king gives us the signal to commence the attack, and then he drops his barrier.

 As soon as that happens, we begin to assault the green-eyed drone with every long range spell we can think of, while the king of the underground is also using his aura manipulation to put some more pressure on our enemy.

 "I know this may sound a little counter-intuitive," I say, in a low voice, "but I think the best thing we can do right now is to keep that barrier up as much as possible, even if it ends up breaking."
"Oh?" the king of the underground tells me. "Why would you say that?"

"Well," I say, "from what the Overseer told us, it sounded like the shockwaves are only an unintended side-effect of his 'experimental procedure', and not the thing that he was actually aiming to do. He said that he's trying to fix the issue, so maybe we should give him some time to do just that."

"You are suggesting that we should let our enemy do exactly what he wants?..." Peter asks.

"I'm saying that I'd rather take my chances with whatever his experimental procedure is supposed to be, than have to fight him while he's still releasing those waves of energy at us," I answer him. "There's no way we can defend ourselves against something like that without the hardened aura shields."

"And after the shield breaks?" Peter says, as another shockwave hits the king's invisible barrier, generating a few more cracks. "What then?"

"Then we'll have Flower teleporting us far away from here, and we won't come back until we have a proper plan," I say. "There's no point in continuing to fight a battle that we know we can't win. Or at least I think there's no point. I'm still a little new to this whole 'trying not to be needlessly reckless' thing."

 "Fair enough," the king of the underground says. "For now, let's wait until my barrier gives in completely, and we'll see where we go from there."
We wait in silence for the next shockwaves to come, while we watch more and more cracks forming in the invisible barrier in front of us. After taking two more direct hits from the Overseer's energy waves, the invisible shield finally breaks, leaving us completely defenseless.

"Okay, that's it," I say. "Flower, get ready to teleport us somewhere far awa--"

"Thank you for your patience," the Overseer says all of a sudden, as the weird noises that it was making until now are finally stopping. "The issue has been resolved. The experimental procedures will now continue as scheduled."

"So, umm... just out of curiosity..." I tell the Overseer, "these experimental procedures of yours wouldn't happen to include any more of those deadly shockwaves, would they?"

"Negative," the Overseer says. "The disintegrating shockwaves were never a part of the original planned procedures."

"Hey, that's great!" I say. "At least we can rest assured that there won't be any more instant death scenarios right off the--"

"Barry, watch out!" Flower shouts, and she teleports me away, as a huge disintegrating beam that got suddenly fired by the green-eyed drone was just about to reach me.

 "The Overseer protocol is pleased to announce that its first test of the disintegrating beam is a success," the green-eyed drone says, once it is done with its attack. "We will now be commencing the second phase of testing, which will involve firing more than one beam at the same time. To ensure the most optimal testing conditions, please remain stationary so that the drones can hit you more easily. Thank you in advance for your continued cooperation."
As the Overseer is saying this, a few dozen red-eyed drones are appearing out of nowhere throughout the ether, completely surrounding us. I quickly use my air currents to dodge one of their disintegrating beams and then I destroy two of the drones with a lightning spell, so that I can fly past them.

"Everyone scatter!" I shout at the others, as I make my way out of the perimeter that the drones were surrounding. "We need to divide the Overseer's attention as much as we can! And don't stop moving even for a moment!"

"We already know what we need to do," Peter says, as he takes out four drones by himself with an ice spell and then flies away from his other attackers. "None of us were born yesterday."

"Right," I say, as twenty drones suddenly materialize all around me, blocking my every possible path of escape.

 Just as the flying metal balls are about to shoot their beams, I unleash a powerful wave of fire that encompasses the entire area around me. The red-eyed drones don't get the time to react and they are easily turned into burning scrap metal, which then continues to float in place, because there is no force in this realm to make it fall down.
Hah. I knew it! I knew that asking Flower to teach me a spell that can deal with a large amount of drones all at once would be a good idea!

Okay, so that must have earned me a few seconds of thinking, at least. Let's see if I can come up with a plan or something.

As I look all around me to see what the situation on the battlefield is, different thoughts are racing through my head at a very high speed. How do I deal with this? Can I dispel disintegration? No, no, no, these beams that the drones are shooting at us are completely black. It's like they're swallowing up all of the light around them. I don't think this kind of an effect can even be achieved on the earthen plane. I've read tons of articles from scholars that have researched disintegration in the past, and most of them agreed that such a spell should only be possible in ideal environments that cannot be created on a material plane of existence.

 But what about the theory behind this spell? Wasn't there some kind of weakness that I could exploit? There were so many details written in those articles... There had to have been something that I can make use of. If only I could remember!
While I am racking my brain, trying to find a solution, I notice Peter doing something very peculiar in the background. Unlike the rest of us who are mostly either trying to evade the drones' attacks or attempting to destroy them, Peter seems to be more focused on the disintegrating beams themselves. He appears to be waiting for the exact time when a drone attacks him, and then he tries to place a ball of fire in front of the pitch black beam, as he moves to the side to avoid getting hit.

When I realize what he is doing, my brain is immediately flooded by a swarm of information that I would have otherwise considered to be forgotten forever. I understand now what he's trying to do. I know exactly which theory he's trying to test, but... he's doing it wrong. I have to tell him about this.

"Peter, you can't get the fire inside the beam like that," I say loudly, as I dodge another disintegrating beam coming from a drone that was near me. "Remember what Krygell said in his article! The only way in which the experiment can work, in theory, is if there's some way to shield the fire from the effects of the disintegration until it is engulfed by the beam completely. Otherwise, the edges of the black beam would simply reduce it to nothing."

 "You've... read professor Krygell's article?..." Peter asks me, shocked.
"Yes, but that's not the point," I say, as I'm flying around, dodging disintegrating beams left and right. "I just realized that there is a way to make this work, but we all need to work together."

"What do you mean?" Peter says, as he destroys two more drones, but then two others pop up from nowhere to take their place.

"The one thing that all the scholars agreed on when talking about disintegration was that auras are by far the most resistant to it," I say. "We've already seen how well the king of the underground's hardened aura barrier could withstand that shockwave from before, and we also have Flower, who is an ethereal and a fire elementalist, so she would be the perfect candidate for an experiment like this, thanks to the huge amount of control that she has over her flames. If you and I can keep the other drones away from them in the meantime, they might just be able to pull it off, but we need to hurry!"

}
#if(v_b3_ch9_element == 1) {
 Just as the flying metal balls are about to shoot their beams, I conjure a large sphere of water around me which quickly shoots dozens of water jets in all directions. The jets pass through the drones' red eyes before they have the time to react, essentially destroying them and then leaving their metal corpses to float in place, because there is no force in this realm to make them fall down. Once my attack is over, the water sphere around me disappears into thin air, so that I can get a proper look at the onslaught that I've caused.
Hah. I knew it! I knew that asking Illuna to teach me a spell that can deal with a large amount of drones all at once would be a good idea!

Okay, so that must have earned me a few seconds of thinking, at least. Let's see if I can come up with a plan or something.

No, no, no, these beams that the drones are shooting at us are completely black. It's like they're swallowing up all of the light around them. I don't think this kind of an effect can even be achieved on the earthen plane. I've read tons of articles from scholars that have researched disintegration in the past, and most of them agreed that such a spell should only be possible in ideal environments that cannot be created on a material plane of existence.

 But what about the theory behind this spell? Wasn't there some kind of weakness that I could exploit? There were so many details written in those articles... There had to have been something that I can make use of. If only I could remember!
While I am racking my brain, trying to find a solution, I notice Peter doing something very peculiar in the background. Unlike the rest of us who are mostly either trying to evade the drones' attacks or attempting to destroy them, Peter seems to be more focused on the disintegrating beams themselves. He appears to be waiting for the exact time when a drone attacks him, and then he tries to place a ball of fire in front of the pitch black beam, as he moves to the side to avoid getting hit.

When I realize what he is doing, my brain is immediately flooded by a swarm of information that I would have otherwise considered to be forgotten forever. I understand now what he's trying to do. I know exactly which theory he's trying to test, but... he's doing it wrong. I have to tell him about this.

"Peter, you can't get the fire inside the beam like that," I say loudly, as I dodge another disintegrating beam coming from a drone that was near me. "Remember what Krygell said in his article! The only way in which the experiment can work, in theory, is if there's some way to shield the fire from the effects of the disintegration until it is engulfed by the beam completely. Otherwise, the edges of the black beam would simply reduce it to nothing."

 "You've... read professor Krygell's article?..." Peter asks me, shocked.
"Yes, but that's not the point," I say, as I'm flying around, dodging disintegrating beams left and right. "I just realized that there is a way to make this work, but we all need to work together."

"What do you mean?" Peter says, as he destroys two more drones, but then two others pop up from nowhere to take their place.

"The one thing that all the scholars agreed on when talking about disintegration was that auras are by far the most resistant to it," I say. "We've already seen how well the king of the underground's hardened aura barrier could withstand that shockwave from before, and we also have Flower, who is an ethereal and a fire elementalist, so she would be the perfect candidate for an experiment like this, thanks to the huge amount of control that she has over her flames. If you and I can keep the other drones away from them in the meantime, they might just be able to pull it off, but we need to hurry!"

 Just as the flying metal balls are about to shoot their beams, I send out a flurry of wind blades in all directions. The wind blades pass through the drones' red eyes before they have the time to react, essentially destroying them and then leaving their metal corpses to float in place, because there is no force in this realm to make them fall down.
Hah. I knew it! I knew that asking Melindra to teach me a spell that can deal with a large amount of drones all at once would be a good idea!

Okay, so that must have earned me a few seconds of thinking, at least. Let's see if I can come up with a plan or something.

 Just as the flying metal balls are about to shoot their beams, I unleash a blast of freezing magic that encompasses the entire area around me. The red-eyed drones don't get the time to react and they are easily turned into statues of ice, which then continue to float in place, because there is no force in this realm to make them fall down.
Hah. I knew it! I knew that asking Kate to teach me a spell that can deal with a large amount of drones all at once would be a good idea!

 "Peter, does this plan of his sound feasible to you?" the king of the underground asks, as he also destroys a few drones with his aura techniques.
"It-- it does... my lord," Peter says.

"Then that is what we'll do," the king says. "Flower, I trust that you understood what you need to do?"

"Um... yeah," Flower says, somewhat confused. "Make a ball of fire and try to get it inside one of the black beams. I can do that."

"Then do it," the king says. "I will shield your flames with my aura manipulation technique as soon as you create them."

"Roger that!" Flower says, and then she creates her flames in front of her, waiting for a drone to attack her.

"Kill every drone that isn't directly in front of her," I tell Peter, as I fly towards Flower and begin destroying several drones with my spells. "She needs to keep all her focus on her flames."

 As Peter and I are busy fighting the drones, Flower and the king of the underground manage to position the aura-shielded ball of fire exactly in the path of one of the incoming disintegrating beams. Just as the black beam engulfs the flames completely, the king cancels his hardened aura shield and the flames quickly begin to absorb the black energy of the beam from the inside, until all that is left is a ball of pure black fire, of the likes that I've never seen.
"Black flames..." Peter says while looking at the black ball of fire, in awe. "So, it can be done..."

"Flower," I say. "Hurl those flames of yours at the green-eyed drone, will you? That should get his attention."

When the green-eyed drone sees the black flames heading in its direction, it immediately places five red-eyed drones in a straight line in front of it so that they can block the incoming attack. This strategy does not pay off in the slightest, however, because the flames simply pass through the metal balls, obliterating them instantly just by touching them.

 "Warning! Warning! Warning!" the green-eyed drone says, as it begins to fly around in circles, while being chased by Flower's black fire. "The danger levels have crossed all acceptable thresholds and therefore the first experimental procedure must be canceled prematurely. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we will begin the second experimental procedure ahead of schedule."
"Second experimental procedure?..." I say. "What second experimental--"

All of a sudden, Flower's ball of fire turns back to its normal orange color, while the red-eyed drones disappear, and now a very large blue summoning circle is starting to form below us.

"Oh no," I say, as we're all getting away from the blue light that is quickly beginning to envelop the area. "Oh no, no, no... Please tell me this isn't going to be another red-eyed mammoth."

 My question gets answered very soon, when a forty foot tall monstrosity begins to slowly materialize in front of us. As I take a good look at it, I realize that I am at a bit of a lack of words for describing it, because I've never seen anything like it before. What is it supposed to be exactly? A flying hydra? A seven-headed dragon?
It doesn't have any legs, like a dragon would, but the wings are exactly like those of a drake, and its heads all have different colors. The colors are red, green, yellow, dark blue, light blue, white and brown. Actually, now that I take a better look at it, it's not just the heads that have these colors, but the entirety of the snake-like creatures coming out of the main body, while the body itself has more of a light red tint to it.

I've researched many creatures before joining this tournament, both mythical and non-mythical, and I'm quite certain that nothing close to this has ever come up during my studies. Could this be the Overseer's own original creation?

"Experiment number two," the Overseer says. "You are right now looking at a being that had the potential to exist on the earthen plane but never came to be, due to a multitude of unfortunate factors. It has no official name, so you can call it whatever you like. If you survive the experiment, the Overseer protocol would very much like to hear your first-hand impressions of the creature, as the information would be particularly valuable."

 "Oh yeah?" I say. "Well, how about you take your information, and shove it up your... green eye socket... or whatever else would make sense in this context since you don't actually have an--"
I do not have the time to finish my sentence, as one of the hydra's heads breathes fire in my direction, and I am forced to get out of its way. Right after that, one of the other heads shoots a beam of ice out of its mouth, forcing Flower to fly away as well.

As I was looking at the flying hydra, I could not help but notice that the fire came out of the red head, while the ice came out of the head with a light-blue color. There's also the fact that the number of heads which the hydra has is exactly the same as the number of magical elements that exist in the world, if you also count the non-traditional ones like acid, ice and electricity. Surely, this can't be a coincidence, right?...

"Guys, I'm not sure if you've figured it out already, but I'm gonna say it anyway, just in case," I say. "I think that this hydra's heads might each represent a different element, and that we should be able to tell which one is which by their colors."

 "I think you might be right," Peter says, as he is looking very attentively at the seven-headed hydra that is at the moment just staring at us menacingly. "If we go by simple logic, my guess is that dark blue means water, white means air, green means acid, uh... yellow means..."
"Yellow is probably lightning," I say. "We already saw what red and light blue are, so that only leaves brown as earth."

"An earth-breathing hydra head?..." Peter says. "What kind of nonsense is this?"

"Look, it doesn't matter if it breathes earth or not," I say. "The important part is that it will likely be doing something earth-related. And now that we know all this, it should be easier to fight it, since we already know what a hydra's weaknesses are. If it's like a normal hydra, then we could try to chop all its heads off at once, burn it with fire, or stab its heart. Either one of these options should work, hopefully, but we should probably stick to just one for now."

 "If it's all the same to you, I'd like to begin by cutting all of its heads off," I say.
"Hold on a minute," Peter says. "Isn't a hydra supposed to regrow two heads after you sever one of them?"

"Oh, no, actually that's just a misconception," I say. "We thought so too until we met a real hydra in one of the underground ruins of Varathia and saw that it's just a monster with very high regenerative powers. The reason why you need to chop off all of its heads at once is because it can just grow them back mere seconds after you cut them, so the fight will never end. Look, I'll show you!"

I then send twenty or so wind blades towards the flying hydra, severing its heads all at once.

 "There we go!" I say, as the hydra's snake-like necks are now just squirming around aimlessly. "No more hydra!"
Not long after I stop talking, the necks begin to regenerate very fast, but instead of growing back to their original forms, they split into two and create two heads for each one that had been cut. Before I get a chance to react, the hydra teleports in front of me instantly and it lunges at me with all of its fourteen heads.

The last thing I get to experience is my ethereal body getting melted by acid saliva, as one of the green hydra heads swallows me whole, and then I lose my consciousness completely.

I then create a very large disc of ice next to the hydra, and make it spin really quickly. Before the monster gets to understand what's going on, I send the disc flying in the hydra's direction, slicing through all of its necks easily.

 "There we go!" I say, as the hydra's snake-like necks are now just squirming around aimlessly. "No more hydra!"

The reason why you need to chop off all of its heads at once is because it can just grow them back mere seconds after you cut them, so the fight will never end."

I pause for a few seconds before I continue.

"Unfortunately, I just realized that I don't really have a spell in my repertoire that can help me cut all the heads off at once," I say. "Most of my powerful attacks are fire spells that I've learned from Flower, and as you may have realized by now, fire is not exactly the best element to use if you want to slice through things. Maybe you could give me a hand, Peter?"

"If you think I'm going to risk cutting a hydra's heads off based purely on your anecdotal evidence, then you are out of your mind," Peter says. "Burning it with fire is obviously our safest bet. I'm going to toss a fireball at it. Feel free to join me if you want."

 As Peter throws his fireball at the hydra, Flower envelops the monster in a large column of fire, and I decide to do the same, using one of the stronger spells that Flower taught me. The flying hydra begins to scream in pain with the majority of its heads, but then it teleports instantly right in front of Flower, lunging at her with two of its snake-like necks. She barely manages to dash away from it by using her fire jets, but the hydra closes in on her again by using its immense wings to propel itself forward.
"The Overseer protocol forgot to mention that this particular hydra represents the pinnacle of evolution for all species of hydras that have ever existed and will ever exist," the green-eyed drone says. "Throughout time, this monster has developed a very high resistance to fire, it has evolved to a point where it has multiple hearts instead of just one, and even if you sever all of its heads, it will simply grow back twice as many as it had before. Allow me to demonstrate."

Suddenly, out of nowhere, a very long spinning blade comes flying straight for the hydra while it was still chasing Flower, and it cuts through all of its long necks with ease. While the blade slowly stops spinning and then disappears into thin air, the snake-like necks squirm aimlessly for a few seconds, and then they each split into two as they quickly grow back, creating two heads for each one that has been cut.

"Ah, crap..." I say, as the hydra is now frantically turning all of its fourteen heads around, trying to figure out which one of us attacked it.

 Shortly after I stop talking, I begin to feel one of the most eerie and hard to describe sensations that I've ever experienced in my life. The feeling that I'm getting is as if my consciousness is being repeatedly thrust through a tunnel, back and forth, and it can't seem to decide at which end of the tunnel its destination is. 
As this is happening, I'm finding myself for one second lying face-first in a puddle on a street, during a storm, and for the next second I'm back here on the ethereal plane, floating in the middle of the sea of light. After being thrown around between the earthen and ethereal plane a few more times, I can sense all of the light around me connecting directly to my mind, and then I begin to hear some very clear thoughts in my head, as if they were my own, even though I am positive that I'm not the one thinking them.

"This is not the place to resolve your conflict," the voice in my head says. "Return to your sanctuaries now, and disturb these resting grounds no longer."

"Peter, did you hear that too?" the king of the underground says, as we're all temporarily frozen in place, unsure of what to do. "Who contacted us just now? Was it the ether?"

While the blade slowly stops spinning and then disappears into thin air, the snake-like necks squirm aimlessly for a few seconds, and then they each split into two as they quickly grow back, creating two heads for each one that has been cut.

"Ah, crap..." I say, as the hydra is now frantically turning all of its fourteen heads around, trying to figure out which one of us attacked it.

 Shortly after I stop talking, I begin to feel one of the most eerie and hard to describe sensations that I've ever experienced in my life. The feeling that I'm getting is as if my consciousness is being repeatedly thrust through a tunnel, back and forth, and it can't seem to decide at which end of the tunnel its destination is. 
As this is happening, I'm finding myself for one second lying face-first in a puddle on a street, during a storm, and for the next second I'm back here on the ethereal plane, floating in the middle of the sea of light. After being thrown around between the earthen and ethereal plane a few more times, I can sense all of the light around me connecting directly to my mind, and then I begin to hear some very clear thoughts in my head, as if they were my own, even though I am positive that I'm not the one thinking them.

"This is not the place to resolve your conflict," the voice in my head says. "Return to your sanctuaries now, and disturb these resting grounds no longer."

"Peter, did you hear that too?" the king of the underground says, as we're all temporarily frozen in place, unsure of what to do. "Who contacted us just now? Was it the ether?"

"I'm... not sure..." Peter says, as he is looking towards the king, with a somewhat fearful look in his eyes.

 "We should probably start by trying to stab its heart," I say.
"Stab its heart how?" Peter says. "From what I've heard, every hydra is born with its heart in a different place, as some sort of evolutionary self-defense mechanism to help protect its only major weakness. We'd be much better off just burning it to death. Technically, its heart will also get destroyed this way, and we won't have to waste time finding a needle in a haystack."

"I suppose you do have a point," I say. "So, should we burn it on the count of three, then?"

"Just follow my lead," Peter says. "You guys can cast your spells as soon as I've thrown my fireball at it."

As Peter throws his fireball at the hydra like he said, Flower envelops the monster in a large column of fire, and I decide to do the same, using one of the stronger spells that Flower taught me. The flying hydra begins to scream in pain with the majority of its heads, but then it teleports instantly right in front of Flower, lunging at her with two of its snake-like necks. She barely manages to dash away from it by using her fire jets, but the hydra closes in on her again by using its immense wings to propel itself forward.

 "The Overseer protocol forgot to mention that this particular hydra represents the pinnacle of evolution for all species of hydras that have ever existed and will ever exist," the green-eyed drone says. "Throughout time, this monster has developed a very high resistance to fire, it has evolved to a point where it has multiple hearts instead of just one, and even if you sever all of its heads, it will simply grow back twice as many as it had before. Allow me to demonstrate."

 "Processing... Processing..." the Overseer says. "Insufficient data available. The Overseer protocol requires more encounters with the mysterious being that just contacted us in order to properly assess its threat level. The experiments will continue as scheduled, until a final conclusion has been reached."
"Are you insane?!" Peter asks the Overseer. "You want to challenge what could possibly be the ether itself just because you don't have... enough data?"

"Please remain calm," the Overseer says. "The experiments will not be conducted in ideal conditions if you do not retain complete control of your mental faculties."

As the Overseer finishes its sentence, twelve of the hydra's heads begin to roar loudly and menacingly. The only two heads that remain silent are the brown ones, which are simply watching each one of us in turn, looking as if they were trying to choose their next target.

"Well..." I say, as I get in a stance and begin to make a few hand gestures in quick succession. "If fire doesn't work, then we might as well try electricity."

 I then point my finger towards the hydra, and a bolt of lightning shoots out of it, straight for the monster. Just like with the fire, the hydra seems to feel the pain of it, but aside from that, it doesn't look like my attack is having much of an effect on the creature except for making it target me next.
I anticipate its teleporting attack and dash backwards by using my air currents, but immediately after its teleportation, the monster sprays acid with both its green heads in all of the area around me. Even though I manage to create a dome of rock just in time to protect me from the brunt of the attack, the acid is very quickly eating through the rock, and the hydra seems to be pouring more acid at a faster rate than I can reinforce the stone.

"You're covered!" the king of the underground says, as he makes a very tall invisible shield between me and the hydra that is stopping the rest of the acid from reaching me. "Now get away from there!"

"You don't have to tell me twice," I say, as I quickly fly backwards, until I am out of range from the hydra's breath attacks.

While I am distancing myself from the monster, I feel my consciousness being sent back to the earthen plane a few more times, but this time things are happening a little differently. Instead of switching perspectives between the two planes of existence, I am beginning to become aware of my surroundings in both planes simultaneously. 

 The only other occasion when I experienced something similar to this was when the Magium tried to erase me and Leila from existence in the seredium tower. For now, my main consciousness still seems to be in the ethereal plane, but at the same time I am also in control of my real body from the earthen plane, except that it doesn't really feel like my body at the moment. It feels more like some kind of... puppet... that I'm controlling with invisible strings.
Come to think of it, I remember Flower saying the same thing about her own body on the earthen plane. That it feels like she's controlling a puppet. Could this be how Flower has been living her life this whole time?

While I am busy contemplating my own existence, I suddenly detect a good number of red-eyed drones approaching me on the earthen plane, as I am still lying on the ground in the middle of a puddle. When I finally get up, I see that the king of the underground is awake on the earthen plane as well, and he is right now raising himself into the sky, so that he can fight the drones.

"You too?" I ask the king of the underground, realizing that I am not the only one whose consciousness is constantly switching between planes.

"Yes," the king answers, simply, and then he flies higher into the sky.

 "What's happening?" I hear Flower's voice on the earthen plane, but with Illuna's tonality. "How are you two controlling your earthen bodies? Flower told me that your fight in the ethereal plane is still not over."
When I turn around, I see that Flower has flames in her eyes on this plane of existence as well, except that in here they are currently blue, because Illuna is the one controlling her body.

"I think the ether might be attacking us," I say. "Some mysterious voice in our heads told us to stop fighting and return to our 'sanctuaries', but the Overseer doesn't want to stop."

"By 'sanctuaries' I'm assuming that it is referring to your minds from the ethereal plane..." Illuna says, as she ponders on my words for a few seconds. "Alright, so did it give you a time limit? How long do you have until the ether destroys your souls?"

 "Destroy our souls?..." I say. "Hey now, let's not get hasty! Nobody said anything about destroying any souls. We're just having a little disagreement, that's all."
"Right," Illuna says. "Well, if you don't have a time limit, then I suggest you hurry it up before this 'disagreement' of yours turns into something a lot more final."

As Illuna was talking, I could hear a loud explosion above us, and when I turned my head to see what was happening, I realized that the king of the underground just did another one of his aura shockwaves that sent a few dozen drones crashing down all at once.

"Please refrain from causing any more damage to the red-eyed units," the green-eyed drone tells the king on the ethereal plane. "You are impeding them from completing their task."

 "And what task might that be?" the king of the underground asks.
"The red-eyed units are attempting to carry your unconscious comrades out of the plaza, and to bring them into secure prison cells where they will remain for the foreseeable future," the green-eyed drone says.

"Yes, that's what I thought," the king says.

"If you do not cease your actions on the earthen plane immediately, the Overseer protocol will be forced to take more extreme measures to deal with the threat that you pose to this city's continued prosperity," the Overseer says.

"Extreme measures, you say?..." the king tells the Overseer. "Well, why don't you show these 'extreme' measures to us, then?"

"As you wish," the Overseer says.

 A few seconds later, we begin to hear a very loud alarm sound echoing all throughout the city of Ollendor, which can be heard clearly despite the noise that the storm is still making.
"The city of Ollendor is now in a state of emergency," we hear the metallic voice of the red-eyed drones being transmitted loudly from magical voice magnifiers placed strategically all across the town. "Please evacuate your homes immediately. The red-eyed units will lead you to the designated safe areas in a timely manner. This is not a drill. I repeat. This is not a drill."

"That's your big plan?" I tell the green-eyed drone in the ethereal plane. "Evacuating the city so you can use bigger spells on us without fear of collateral damage? You do realize that the king is still killing your drones faster than you can send them, don't you?"

The Overseer does not say anything, but instead he sends his hydra to attack us again. As we are busy trying to stay alive on the ethereal plane, I begin to feel some earth tremors on the earthen plane, which are only intensifying with every passing moment. When I look around to figure out where this is coming from, I am shocked to see that five of the giant metal golems who were guarding the city gates are now approaching us slowly from a distance, while trampling and destroying every house on their way here.

 "Please remain calm," I hear the red-eyed drones talking through the voice magnifiers again, while people on the streets are running away, terrified. "The red-eyed units will ensure your safety as long as you follow them. If you are worried about your destroyed houses, then rest assured that they will be rebuilt, and that you will very soon be reimbursed for all of the monetary losses that you've sustained during this conflict. Have a nice day!"
"No way..." I say, as I look at all the destruction that the metal giants are leaving in their wake.

"Is this your idea of ruling a city?" I ask the Overseer in the ethereal plane. "You're going to destroy an entire neighborhood just to kill two or three people that are opposing you?"

"According to my analysis, the perceived threat of the king of the underground is higher than that of losing several structures," the Overseer says. "Once this final war is over, the citizens and the drones will all work together to repair the damage that has been done."

 "Damn it..." I say. "Hey, king of the underground, are you listening? We need to take the fight away from the plaza or your rebels are going to be squashed to death soon!"
"I can't leave them alone!" the king tells me. "If I fly away now, the red-eyed drones will surely seize the opportunity and capture them all while they're undefended."

"Crap," I say. "You're right."

I then pause for a few seconds, to think of my next course of action.

"In that case, Flower, can you go back to your mind really quick and teleport Hadrik to his sanctuary?" I say. "I'm guessing that he must have remembered where his mind is located, by now. If we can at least have Hadrik awake on the earthen plane, we might have a chance against the golems."

"Only Hadrik?..." Flower says. "What about the others?"

 "Now that you mention it," I tell Flower, "maybe it would be better if you brought the others to their minds too."
"Okay..." Flower says. "But it's going to take a while. You know that, right?"

"Sure, no problem," I say. "We can handle the hydra by ourselves."

"Just don't die till I get back here, alright?" Flower tells me. "I'll try to return as quickly as I can."

She then gets surrounded by a bright light once again, and a few seconds later, she teleports away.

 Now that Flower left, I decide to take a good look around me in both planes of existence, to see what the situation is at the moment. 
From what I can tell, it seems like the Overseer is currently too preoccupied with what's going on in Ollendor to pay attention to us on the ethereal plane, and it shows, because the hydra has barely done anything noteworthy in the past minute except for using its breath attacks against us a few times.

Meanwhile, on the earthen plane, one of the metal golems has gained a significant advance on the other four, and it will very soon get close enough to shoot its fire beam at us. If Hadrik doesn't wake up soon, we might be in trouble.

 I begin to focus my consciousness on the earthen plane and I raise my arms up, causing Melindra's air currents to activate themselves and to propel me upwards.
The strong wind from the storm is giving me a lot of trouble with my maneuvering, just as I expected it to, but at least I still retain full control of the magical currents. I can't imagine how bad this would have been if I had told Melindra to cast the version of the currents where she needed to be awake to help me control them.

Before heading for the golem, I fly around for about twenty seconds or so, trying to see exactly how well I can handle myself in this storm. Like Melindra said, this doesn't feel too different from flying a plane in a hurricane. In fact, I think it might even be a little easier, because the air currents are much more responsive than the controls of a gnomish flying contraption.

Once I'm done testing all of the basic flight maneuvers, I head straight for the metal golem that is closest to us, in the hopes that I can maybe lure it away from the plaza. While I am still in mid-flight, I pull out the crossbow from my backpack and I shoot a few bolts in the golem's head.

"Hey!" I shout at the golem. "Hey, over here! Over here, you big piece of junk!"

I then shoot a few more bolts at it just to make sure that I catch its attention. The golem seems to be finally reacting to me, as it is now turning around and opening its mouth, ready to shoot a fire beam at me.

 I begin to fly around erratically, to make it harder for the metal giant to anticipate my movements. The golem fires a beam towards me, and then another, and then another, missing every time, but also getting closer with each consecutive shot. Is it starting to predict my movements?... Maybe I'm not flying randomly enough.
As I am trying to adjust my flight patterns so that they are harder to guess, the golem shoots a fire beam only a few inches away from me, and suddenly I can feel my heart beating two times faster than before.

How did it get so close to me? Am I really that predictable? What am I doing wrong?

Realizing that I am very soon going to need to start dodging the lasers right when the golem shoots them, I begin to panic a little. 

Will I be fast enough to dodge every one of its attacks?

If I were to stand in place now and only get out of the beam's way at the very last second when the golem fires it at me, would I be able to do it?

As I manage to very narrowly evade another fire beam, I suddenly get the answer to my question. Based on the speed of the beam and the distance between me and my enemy, I'd say I should have just enough time to avoid its next few attacks, provided that its path prediction algorithm doesn't get much better than it already is.

 Instead of giving the golem more movement patterns to study, I decide to stop flying around and to just stare straight at it, waiting for it to attack me.
"Hey, I'm right here!" I shout at the golem. "I'm not moving. Are you going to shoot me or what?"

After a few seconds of silence, the golem fires its beam at me, and I move out of the way at the last possible moment. Thankfully, my air currents are extremely responsive, so I was able to pull off my stunt perfectly. Having successfully evaded the attack, I stop in mid-air again, so that I can taunt the golem some more.

"You almost got it, buddy!" I tell the metal giant. "Why don't you try again? I'm sure you'll get it next time."

Once again the golem shoots me with its fire beam but I evade it easily, just as it was about to hit me. Seeing that my enemy has now stopped trying to aim for me and it's just standing there, confused, I cross my arms and then the two of us begin to simply look at each other, in complete silence. Our little staring contest continues for a while longer, until I see a small but familiar shape on the ground approaching the golem at a breathtaking speed.

I begin to focus my consciousness on the earthen plane and I raise my arms up, causing Melindra's air currents to activate themselves and to propel me upwards.

When I reach a higher altitude, I quickly realize that the air currents are very unresponsive compared to what they are usually like, and this is almost certainly because of the new version of currents that I asked Melindra to cast on me before the battle. Considering that she is not awake to help me control the currents, I am only getting the disadvantages of this spell and almost none of the advantages. 

Actually, there is one small advantage. Despite their unresponsiveness, at least these currents feel more stable than the old ones, so I don't have to worry that much about the strong wind from the storm messing up my direction. 

Once I'm done testing all of the basic flight maneuvers, I head straight for the metal golem that is closest to us, in the hopes that I can maybe lure it away from the plaza. While I am still in mid-flight, I pull out the crossbow from my backpack and I shoot a few bolts in the golem's head.

"Hey!" I shout at the golem. "Hey, over here! Over here, you big piece of junk!"

I then shoot a few more bolts at it just to make sure that I catch its attention. The golem seems to be finally reacting to me, as it is now turning around and opening its mouth, ready to shoot a fire beam at me.

 I begin to fly around erratically, to make it harder for the metal giant to anticipate my movements.

Realizing that I am very soon going to need to start dodging the lasers right when the golem shoots them, I begin to panic a little. 

Will I be fast enough to dodge every one of its attacks? And what about the limited responsiveness of the currents? How badly is that going to affect me when I need to take split second decisions?

As I manage to very narrowly evade another fire beam, I suddenly realize that the golem had been tilting its head slightly to the side each time, right before attacking me. How did I not notice this until now?

 Using this new information that I've learned, I keep flying in the same way that I normally did for a while longer, but as soon as I see the golem tilting its head, I immediately dash in the opposite direction. The metal giant gets confused by this, and it tries to aim for me once more, but as soon as it tilts its head again, I quickly change my direction, leaving the poor golem in an even more perplexed state than before.
After we repeat these exact same motions a few more times, the golem begins to just stand there, without doing anything, probably because it's trying to understand why its flawless path prediction algorithm is no longer working as intended. This staring contest between us continues for a while longer, until I see a small but familiar shape on the ground approaching the golem at a breathtaking speed.

As I manage to very narrowly evade another fire beam, I suddenly get the answer to my question. Based on the speed of the beam and the timing of my reaction, I'd say that my reflexes should in fact be good enough to compensate for the currents' unresponsiveness. It will be very close, though. One small mistake and I'm toast. Let's hope that I can hold out at least until Hadrik gets here.

 Just as I had feared, the golem's path prediction algorithm has now been perfected to such a degree that no matter how chaotically I think I'm moving, the metal giant will always be one step ahead of me. After dodging two more beams by relying solely on my reflexes, I decide to stop in mid-air and to taunt the golem, since there really isn't much point in trying to outsmart it anymore.
"Come on!" I shout at the golem, while waving my arms around like a lunatic. "I'm right here! What are you waiting for?! Give it your best shot!"

After a few seconds of silence, the golem fires its beam at me, and I move out of the way at the last possible moment. I then stop somewhere above the golem again, so that I can taunt it some more.

"What's wrong?!" I shout. "Is your fancy algorithm too stupid to hit a stationary target? Can't predict my moves anymore if I'm standing in place? Huh?!"

Once again the golem shoots me with its fire beam but I evade it easily, just as it was about to hit me. Seeing that my enemy has stopped trying to aim for me and it's just standing there, confused, I shrug at it from a distance with my arms stretched, and then we continue to watch each other for a while without saying anything.

While I am still waiting for my opponent to make a move, I see a small but familiar shape on the ground approaching the golem at a breathtaking speed.

 Before the metal giant gets to understand what's happening, the small shape, also known as Hadrik, makes a high jump and it punches the golem in the head, sending it flying about fifty feet backwards and then causing it to land on its back on a few empty houses that got completely wrecked in the process. The dwarf does not give the golem the time to get back up and he jumps on its head, punching it several more times until the enemy stops moving completely.
"Hey, I'm back!" Hadrik shouts at me, while still standing on the golem's head. "Did you miss me?"

"You have no idea..." I answer him.

"So, what's the plan, here?" Hadrik says. "Should I also take care of the other four golems really quick? Is there anything else I should know about before I go?"

"Forget about the golems," the king of the underground says loudly, as he is now flying closer to us. "I have a much better task for you. Let's all get a little closer to each other first. I don't want a certain someone to listen in on our conversation."

The king and I then both fly towards the ground, as Hadrik gets off the metal golem and walks in our direction to meet us halfway.

"Alright," Hadrik says, once we're all close to each other. "You said you had a task for me. Let's hear it."

 "Do you remember what the original purpose of our mission to the surface was?" the king says, as he takes out a small metal device out of his pocket. "The reason why we risked so many people's lives despite knowing what an overwhelming force the Overseer had at his disposal?"
"Yeah, um..." Hadrik says. "We came here to destroy the, uhm... core, was it?... Yeah, the Overseer's core."

"Precisely," the king says, and then he hands Hadrik the metal device. "And this little device is what's going to lead you to our main objective. Here, let me show you how to use it."

He then presses a button on the device, and a small three-dimensional holographic map of our surrounding area begins to float above it, similar to the map that Arraka made for us when we were walking through the ogre fort in search of the sacred chalice. This map does not seem to be as detailed as the one made by Arraka, and there are no colored dots to indicate the enemies and allies in our vicinity, but there are however two dots, which I'm assuming are the only ones that are needed for our current purposes.

"I see that neither of you are surprised," the king says, after looking at each of us in turn. "Should I take it that you've seen a holographic map before?"

"Yeah," I say. "Arraka cast one for us in the past."

 "The banshee in the amulet, right..." the king says. "Well, this particular map is nothing too fancy. It's just a simple illusion spell that indicates the device's current position and the position of the core, displaying them as dots on a three-dimensional map. The device was made by doctor Reidzek, so the chances of it malfunctioning should be very low. Anyway, the point is that with the Overseer focusing his attention and most of his forces on this plaza, and with the additional distraction that is created by our ongoing battle against him in the ethereal plane, there is no better moment than this to go destroy his core. Hadrik, with your speed and strength, you should be able to get to this location on the map, eliminate all remaining defenses and destroy the core in a matter of minutes. This whole fight could be over in mere minutes, do you understand what I'm saying?"
"Okay, I get it, but what about the flying metal balls and the giant golems?" Hadrik says. "Couldn't they kill you in minutes too?"

"You leave those to us," the king says, as he pats me on the back. "Barry and I have got it all covered. Isn't that right, Barry?"

"Uh, sure..." I say. "Sure, why not?"

"See?" the king tells Hadrik. "No problem here. Now go! Go, before the Overseer figures out what we're doing!"

 "Right," Hadrik says. "See you in a bit."
He then dashes in the direction that was being shown on the holographic map, and he disappears from our field of view in a few seconds.

"Now, then..." the king says, as he turns to me. "Do you think you can stall the rest of those golems for a few minutes like you did with the first one, or should I do it?"

"I think I can handle the golems," I say. "You go deal with the drones from the plaza."

"Very well," the king of the underground says. "Good luck."

"Good luck to you too," I say, and then the two of us part ways, flying in opposite directions.

As I am making my way towards the golems on the earthen plane, I notice the hydra on the ethereal plane making a beeline for me and I am forced to stop what I was doing in Ollendor to focus on evading the hydra.

The metal giants are, however, getting closer and closer to the plaza with each passing second. I can't afford to ignore them just because the hydra is attacking my soul on a different plane of existence. If I really want to make it out of this alive, then I'm going to need to find a way to control both my soul and my earthen body at the same time.

 I close my eyes while the hydra is chasing me and I try to visualize the environments from Ollendor and the ether. On the one hand I've got an endless sea of light, and on the other, I have the wind blowing in my face and a whole bunch of wrecked buildings that I am flying over.
When I will open my eyes, I will see both of these environments at the same time. I will be able to control my bodies from both planes at the same time. I can do this. I can do this.

"What is wrong with you?!" I hear Peter shouting at me in the ethereal plane. "Open your eyes, you fool! The hydra is gaining on you!"

As soon as I do what Peter said, I see the hydra in front of me, ready to take a bite off me, but I'm also seeing the storm and the crashed buildings in my peripheral vision. Even though I'm not focusing on it right now, I feel like I could seamlessly switch my consciousness to my earthen body and then back to my soul again by just blinking my eyes.

I use a gust of wind to push myself away from the hydra before it lunges for me, and then I blink. 

Now I'm back in Ollendor, getting dangerously close to the four metal golems. One of them attacks me with a fire beam, and I roll in mid-air to the right side, getting out of the way in time and then continuing my flight towards them at a high speed. 

 Meanwhile, with the corner of my eye I see Peter spraying the hydra with acid in the ethereal plane. The monster brushes off the attack, just like it did with all of the other elements that we've thrown at it, and once it regenerates itself, it begins to go after Peter. I take advantage of this brief pause in the ethereal plane to position myself between two golems, hoping that I can trick them into destroying themselves by shooting their beams at each other. Sadly, the golems are not as stupid as I would have wished, and instead of shooting me, they're slowly walking towards me so that they can squash me between their palms.
I blink again and switch my main focus to the ethereal plane, so that I can fly closer to the hydra and give Peter a helping hand. I begin to do the necessary hand motions for a paralysis spell, and once I am within range, I immediately cast it on the creature.

To our shock, the monster freezes in place right after I hit it with my spell, and it just stays like that for ten seconds, before it finally breaks free. Ten whole seconds of immobilization from a spell that is designed to paralyze human-sized beings?... That is incredible! A mammoth would have barely gotten stopped for more than a second by a spell like this.

Could it be possible that we've finally found the hydra's only weakness?

 As Peter and I look at each other from a distance, it takes only a few moments for us to figure out that we are both thinking the same thing, so we both nod curtly and then we hurry up to get into position for casting a grand-scale spell of the likes that the ethereal realm has probably never seen before.
There is only one way to definitively paralyze a monster of this size, and every person who has ever aimed to become a generalist should know of it. It is one of sage Drakesbane's favorite spells, and I heard that he routinely uses it whenever he goes on his dragon hunts. Neither me nor Peter could ever dream of casting such a complex spell by ourselves, but if we were to work together and synchronize ourselves perfectly, it might just be worth a shot...

"My king," Peter says, as the two of us are flying around, setting up invisible magic pillars in strategic positions, so that they can act as catalysts for our large-scale paralysis spell. "Would it be possible to keep the hydra away from us for around... fifty seconds? Barry and I are working on something important."

"Is that so?" the king asks, surprised. "I suppose I could keep it occupied for a minute or so, yes."

He then makes a very large semi-transparent box around the hydra, trapping it inside. Realizing what happened, the hydra tries using its claws and its fangs to dig its way out of the aura cage, but it's not making any progress so far.

 "How's that?" the king asks Peter.
"Perfect!" Peter says, as he creates another pillar in mid-air. "Can you keep trapping it in boxes if it tries to teleport out?"

"I believe I can, yes," the king says, just as the hydra teleports outside of the box only to get trapped in another one.

The hydra now tries to breathe flames at the semi-transparent walls of its enclosure, but the fire only gets repelled by the hardened aura and it comes back to burn the entire content of the box, including the fourteen-headed monster.

"Hahaha... That's not the way to get out of an aura prison, you stupid creature," the king of the underground says, as he almost breaks out in a fit of laughter while watching the hydra squirm in pain.

 While I am busy setting up the pillars on the ethereal plane, I also make sure to blink from time to time, so that I can switch my perspective to the earthen plane and position myself in a place where the golems can't shoot at me without risking to destroy each other. After I change my location a few times, I suddenly realize that I may have run out of places to hide from all four golems, and that I might be forced to dodge all of their attacks very soon.

 "Are you sure that your shield can hold against four fire beams at the same time?" I ask Daren, as I fly behind him.
"I suppose we're about to find out," Daren says, and then he raises his shield, creating a semi-transparent barrier around us.

The golems are now aligning themselves so they can get a better shot at us, and they are beginning to open fire on us one by one. So far, Daren's barrier seems to be holding up nicely, but there's no telling when it will start to crack.

"So, are we just stalling them, or?..." Daren asks me, as all four beams are now hitting the barrier.

"We just need to keep them busy for another minute or two," I say.

"Why?" Daren says. "What happens in two minutes?"

"The end of the battle, hopefully," I say, as I blink and then switch back to the ethereal plane to create two more of the magical pillars that were needed to cast the paralysis spell.

As soon as I am done placing the last pillar, I give the 'okay' signal to Peter so that we can commence our simultaneous casting.

 The semi-invisible pillars that have been placed in a circle around the hydra are now all lighting up, and they are beginning to form a perimeter of green light around the monster. The light is getting more and more intense by the second, while the area inside the perimeter is getting bombarded by magical energy.
As the king of the underground releases the hydra from its imprisonment, the green lights from the pillars are now all attacking the monster in unison. Realizing that its time is at an end, the hydra roars loudly with the majority of its heads. The only heads that remain silent, just like the last time, are the brown-colored ones. Coincidentally, these are also the only heads that haven't used any sort of breath attacks so far.

No breath attacks... No roaring... What are they waiting for, exactly?

 When I see the two hydra heads looking directly at me, I get a sudden chill down my spine and without thinking, I rush towards the king and Peter, while doing some very quick gestures with my hands and chanting a really old incantation that I can't believe I'm still remembering after all the time that passed since I read about it.
Just as I am finishing my spell, the brown hydra heads open their mouths at last, and the sound that they are making is so loud that it feels like it could rupture our eardrums in a matter of seconds. Fortunately for us, the spell that I was casting earlier finally activates itself, creating a large anti-sound barrier around Peter, the king and myself, which blocks all incoming noises, no matter how powerful they are.

As we are standing within our sound-proof shelter, we watch the hydra roaring silently for about another ten seconds or so, until the pillars unleash their last wave of energy upon the monster, turning it into stone.

"Okay...?" I say, as I look a little confused towards the hydra that had turned into a statue and then I deactivate the anti-sound barrier that was surrounding us. "I could have sworn that this spell was meant to just paralyze, not petrify its target. I honestly have no idea where the petrification came from. But hey, I suppose beggars can't be choosers, right?"

"...How did you know?" Peter asks, after looking at me in silence for a few seconds.

"I don't think your shield can hold against four fire beams all at once," I say. "Maybe it would be better if we each fought two golems. I'll try to lure the two on the right. You try seeing if you can catch the attention of the ones on the left."

"Are we only supposed to stall them, or do we need to destroy all of them by ourselves?..." Daren says.

"No, no, we only need to keep them busy for... one minute or two," I say.

"Why?" Daren says loudly, as he is now moving towards the golems on the left. "What happens in two minutes?"

"The end of the battle, hopefully," I say, and then I place myself between two golems again, hoping that this would buy me enough time to create another pillar on the ethereal plane.

Once I blink and switch my main focus to the other plane of existence, I quickly place a new magical pillar in a new position, while I carefully look with the corner of my eye to see what the golems are doing.

To my shock, it seems that one of the golems has finally decided that getting rid of me is worth destroying one of its brethren, and it opens fire on me with no warning.

 Unfortunately, the time it took me to switch back my focus to the earthen plane and to dash away was not enough for me to escape the beam, and the flames burnt me to ashes in a matter of seconds.

 I would've probably been dead if not for my quick reaction time, but I managed to switch my focus back to the earthen plane and to get out of the way just in time to see the golem behind me getting absolutely destroyed by the beam of its comrade-in-arms. The metal giant that attacked me seems to now be regretting its decision, because it is keeping its head down, without making any more movements, as if it were mourning its deceased partner.
This momentary pause gives me the opportunity to go place the final pillar that was needed for the paralysis spell to function in the ethereal plane, and as soon as I'm done, I give the 'okay' signal to Peter so that we can commence our simultaneous casting.

The semi-invisible pillars that have been placed in a circle around the hydra are now all lighting up, and they are beginning to form a perimeter of green light around the monster.

As I am doing this, two of the golems shoot their beams at me, but I was ready for them, and dodged their attacks easily. Now, then... let me take a good look around. Where would be the best spot for me to position myself?

As I keep flying around, trying to figure out what it is that I'm missing, the golems begin attacking me again, and I am forced to dive away from their beams.

As I get a good bird's-eye view of the entire area below me, I finally manage to find what I was looking for. There is exactly one spot that should temporarily shield me from all of the golems at the same time, and that is at the very center of them. As long as I place myself correctly, I should be positioned right between two separate pairs of golems, and at a sufficient enough distance from them that they can't just instantly walk over to me and attack me with their hands.

This is perfect. I'm heading down there right now.

The golems attempt to shoot at me a few times before I get to a lower altitude, but as soon as I place myself in the right spot, they all stop what they were doing, and now they are just looking at me confused.

 "How did I know what?" I say.
"That the hydra was about to hit us with a sonic attack," Peter answers me. "How did you figure it out?"

"Oh, I didn't know for sure," I say. "It was only a hunch. See, the thing is that I've been watching the brown hydra heads closely ever since you mentioned that it wouldn't make any sense for them to breathe rocks, and the truth is that I didn't see them doing any sort of elemental attacks for the whole duration of the battle. However, what I did notice was that these particular heads were the only ones that were always silent while the other heads were roaring or screaming. So, that got me thinking... what if these heads did not in fact have any elemental powers at all? What if their only power was their roar, and they were saving it for a special occasion this whole time? And what better way could there possibly be to use their ultimate weapon than as a last resort, when they were sure that they were about to get killed?"

"Huh..." Peter says, as he looks contemplatively at the stone statue of the hydra, and then at me. "You know... Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you are not the fraud I thought you were. Maybe... you are a generalist after all!"

"The Overseer protocol congratulates you for completing the second experimental procedure," the green-eyed drone says. "Unfortunately, according to my calculations, your chances of surviving the third experimental procedure are very slim. We will, however, continue to ask for your cooperation until--"

 "Warning!" the Overseer begins to say all of a sudden in a monotone voice, similar to that of the red-eyed drones. "The core is under attack. The core is now in a critical state. All personnel in charge of maintenance are immediately asked to--"
"What have you done?" the Overseer now asks us, in his usual, more expressive voice. "Do you not realize what consequences--"

Once more the Overseer gets interrupted, and when he starts speaking again, his voice keeps switching between tonalities in a very unnatural way.

"This is not over--" the Overseer says, as he begins to teleport away from us, while a bright light is enveloping him. "You may have destroyed the core, but I still have the crystals. And the crystals... are the one thing that you cannot afford to destroy... We will... meet again..."

"Damn it, he's getting away!" I say, as I cast a lightning spell at the green-eyed drone, but my attack doesn't get to reach him before he disappears. "Where do you think he went? Back to his sanctuary?"

"Most likely, yes," the king of the underground says. "But it doesn't matter. Look at what's happening on the earthen plane. The drones are dropping like flies from the sky. The giant golems have all fallen to the ground. The Overseer has lost all control over his minions. He is no longer a threat to us."

 "Really?" I ask the king, as I begin to control my body from the earthen plane like a puppet in order to fly it back to the plaza, while signalling Daren to follow me. "You're not at all worried about that ominous warning that he gave us before he disappeared? Not even a little bit?"
"Worried about what?" the king of the underground says. "About the empty threats of a dying machine? Even if he still somehow manages to remain alive after losing his core, he will be only a shadow of his former self. Without an army, the Overseer is just another drone. And you've seen what I can do to drones."

All of a sudden, we hear Flower teleporting back to us and then we get to see the shock on her face, as she looks at the stone hydra and at the place where the Overseer's green-eyed drone used to be.

"Guys, I'm sorry, I didn't get to teleport everyone yet," Flower says, "but I just had to come back here and confirm that what I was picking up with my magical sense was real... Did you really manage to beat both the hydra AND the Overseer while I was away? That's amazing! How did you even do it?"

"Guys, I'm so sorry that I couldn't get back here sooner," Flower says. "I got a really nasty headache because I teleported too many times in a row over large distances and I was worried that I might mess up your fight. I didn't even imagine that you'd beat them so fast! How did you even do it?"

 "As much as I'd like to take the credit for beating the Overseer myself," the king of the underground says, "I'm afraid that your dwarf friend was in fact the one who struck the finishing blow. You did a really good job by sending him back to his own mind. We are all indebted to you."
"Hey, don't mention it!" Flower says. "But... does this mean it's over? Did we win?"

"I... think so, yeah..." I say. "We... we won!"

Just as I am done saying those words, my mind is beginning to get gradually flooded by millions of different voices, along with rapidly changing images that are flashing in front of my eyes at too high of a speed for me to be able to tell what they are about.

The voices are all overlapping, but they're mostly just using different words to say the same thing:

'Leave this place!'

'Get out!'

'You do not belong here.'

 I try to cover my ears, but it doesn't have any effect. The voices are all coming from inside my head, and they're only getting louder. After fifteen more seconds of this, the images stop flashing and my consciousness begins to drift in and out between the ethereal and earthen plane, without me having any control over it anymore. As I am still struggling to regain my composure, the voices all stop at the same time. All except for one: the voice that told us to go back to our sanctuaries while we were still fighting the hydra.
'You had been warned,' the voice tells me simply, and then my consciousness flips back and forth between both planes of existence for a thousand times in a single second, while it feels like my soul is being ripped by force from my body. 

"My king, we need to get you back to your mind now!" Peter says, to the king of the underground, and then the two of them quickly teleport away from us.

It's getting cold. So very cold. My thoughts are all a jumble. An extreme fatigue is now taking over me as it feels like the very essence of my being is slowly fading away, along with my imagined body from the ethereal plane, which is becoming more transparent with each passing moment.

"--arry!" I hear Flower's voice as if it were some distant memory. "Barry, look into my eyes! Look at me! Barry!!!"

 With what seems to be the last remaining ounce of my willpower, I manage to focus my gaze upon Flower, who is currently holding me by the shoulders while her flaming red eyes are shining brighter than ever before. Getting a better look at her, I see that not only her eyes are aflame, but her entire body is now made up entirely of fire... Or rather, the kind of fire that feels hot but for some reason is not burning me, even though she is touching me directly with it.
"Barry, do you remember what it was like inside your mind on the ethereal plane, before the Overseer kicked your soul out of it?" Flower says, loudly. "Can you picture the inside of your sanctuary in front of your eyes right now?"

"The inside of my sanctuary..." I tell her, in a very weak voice. "Yes... It was... like a cube..."

"A cube?" Flower asks. "That's it? That's all you remember?"

"Yeah, it... wasn't like your house, with paintings and... all the other stuff..." I say. "My sanctuary was just... an empty cube..."

"Okay, then I need you to think about the interior of the cube," Flower says. "I need you to visualize it clearly inside your head. Do you understand?"

 "Yes..." I say, with my voice barely louder than a whisper.
Just like she asked, I try to remember every small detail that I can from the place called my 'sanctuary', and then I recreate it inside my head. I then close my eyes, so that I can see the image in my mind more clearly.

"I'm imagining it now..." I tell Flower, in the same weak voice as before.

"Do you have a clear image of it?" Flower says, in a somewhat panicky voice. "Are you certain?"

"Yes, yes," I tell her with my eyes still closed. "I'm looking at it as I'm speaking to you. What do I do now?"

I can no longer see my body from the ethereal plane because my eyes are closed, but I can tell that it's only gotten more transparent since I've started talking to Flower. I wonder how many more seconds I have left to live?...

 "--arry!" Flower says, as I'm beginning to drift in and out of consciousness, catching only bits and pieces of what she is saying to me. "Listen-- me carefully-- no time-- no matter what-- open your eyes! Do-- hear me?! Barry-- losing you! Barry!!!"
It is hard to tell with my eyes still closed, but I think I'm being enveloped by the white light from Flower's teleporting spell again. Is she trying to send me back to my sanctuary? Is that why she asked me to imagine it inside my head?

As I continue to visualize the empty cube in my mind's eye, the bright light from both the teleportation spell and the ether disappears, and the only thing I can see through my eyelids is complete darkness. Does this mean that the teleportation was successful? I can't tell whether my body is back to normal or not. Aside from the light disappearing, I still feel weak, and it doesn't seem like much has changed.

The silence around me is deafening. The anticipation is killing me. Did I get teleported properly or not? I have to know!

 I open my eyes, but to my surprise it is not only the light that is gone from around me, but also everything else. The only thing that I'm seeing before my eyes is pure darkness.
"Flower, are you there?" I try to say, but my words do not leave my mouth.

After trying to talk a few more times, the weakness and fatigue slowly take over me and soon I don't even have the strength to open my mouth anymore. Several seconds later, I find myself closing my eyes again, but this time I lose my consciousness for good.

TEXT: 

 Just as I'm about to open my eyes, I remember Flower's warning from before she teleported me.
"--no matter what-- open your eyes!" were the words I heard her saying.

The phrase is not complete, but based on the structure of the sentence it feels like she was saying something along the lines of "no matter what, don't open your eyes".

I can't be sure of this, but she did tell me that I should keep visualizing the cube, and she never told me when to stop. I still have the image of the cube in front of me right now, so I guess I should probably keep thinking of it. This is the only thing I should be worrying about. Nothing else matters. Just keep imagining the cube.

A whole minute passes without me doing anything other than concentrating on the image of the sanctuary which I have in my head. Or at least I think it's been a minute. It's kind of hard to keep track of time in this complete darkness.

It's fine. There's no need to open my eyes. I'm still conscious for now, and this is all that matters. A minute ago, I could have sworn that I only had a few seconds left to live, but somehow I'm still here. I'm still awake. Whatever Flower did, it must have had at least some positive effect, or else I wouldn't be alive.

 As I'm still waiting for something to happen, I suddenly feel myself being drenched from head to toe in freezing cold water, and when I instinctively jump up, I quickly realize that there is now ground beneath my feet, and it no longer feels like I'm floating in an endless darkness like before. The rain is pouring down my cheeks, a sound of lightning echoes in the distance, and the wind is still blowing.
Is this it?... Am I finally back on the earthen plane for good?

"Are you planning to open your eyes anytime soon, or are you expecting me to talk to you like this?..." I hear Flower's voice, speaking in Illuna's tone.

When I finally open my eyelids, I see Flower standing right in front of me with blue flames in her eyes, confirming to me that Illuna was indeed still the one currently controlling her body on the earthen plane.

Every connection that I had with the ethereal plane is now gone. Even though I'm trying to switch my consciousness to the other realm, it's not working anymore. Could this be the result of my soul finally returning to my sanctuary on the ethereal plane?

 "There was this... darkness," I tell Illuna. "It felt similar to the void that the Magium made me float around in when it almost erased me from the world, except this time I still had my memories and my identity left intact. Wait, no, that's not right... There was also something else different about this... nothingness that I was in. I didn't really get to see it because I had my eyes closed the whole time, but the darkness around me seemed almost... oppressive. Like it was trying to swallow me whole. Do you have any idea what might have happened?"
"Ah, so that's what Flower did," Illuna says. "I had some pretty strong suspicions, but I could barely get any kind of coherent information out of her through our telepathic link when I talked to her earlier. I should probably let her know that she didn't end up killing you by accident before she gives herself a heart attack out of pure anxiety."

"She thought she might have killed me?..." I ask, in an uneasy tone. "Wait, what did she do?"

Instead of answering me, Illuna raises two fingers in the air in front of me, signaling me to be quiet while she talks to Flower telepathically in the ethereal plane. Once she is done, she lowers her hand so that we can resume our conversation.

 "Okay, Flower has calmed down for now," Illuna says. "What were we talking about again? Oh right, the darkness. Well, there's not much to say about it, really. Darkness is the absence of light. The light from the ethereal plane is the ether itself. The ether was the one attacking you, so Flower decided to teleport you in the only place where you'd be truly safe from it. However, the only way to get yourself out of the ethereal abyss is by imagining a place very clearly in your head, and being firmly convinced that you can transport yourself there through your own powers. Seeing that you were no longer breathing on the earthen plane, I assumed that you had failed at your task, so I had to get a little creative."
She then holds out her palm and conjures a floating sphere of water above it, hinting that she was the reason why the water that I was drenched in was three times colder than the rain drops from the storm.

"Wow..." I tell her. "I don't know what to say. Thank you. And Flower. I have no idea what would have happened if you two hadn't intervened the way you did. How did you even come up with these ideas?"

"...Experience," Illuna says. "And a little bit of ingenuity. Let's just say that this isn't the first time when we've had to make use of the ethereal abyss, and it probably won't be the last either. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to check up on Flower. There are still a few matters left unresolved in the ethereal plane that we need to take care of."

"Wait, is Flower okay?" I ask. "I can't switch my consciousness back to the ethereal plane to check. Did she manage to escape from the ether?"

 "Flower is... fine," Illuna says. "For now, at least. I'm not entirely certain, but it's possible that her recent transformation is shielding her from the ether in some way. It is a little hard to speculate without knowing any more details about this new form of hers. Anyway, I'll be right back."
As Illuna turns her focus back to the ethereal plane, leaving Flower's body to look in front of her with an empty stare, I decide to take a little walk around the plaza, to see what the situation is.

It feels strange to not be able to see the perspective of my soul from the ethereal plane anymore, after everything that's happened. Even though I know for a fact that all the things I've experienced on that plane of existence were real, I still can't shake off the feeling that I've only just woken up from a very long dream. 

I wish I could have explored that world more. I wish I could have tested my spells more. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to see that place again...

As I continue to walk around the plaza, I see Peter, the king of the underground and Daren standing around in the middle of a few dozen unconscious rebels, looking as if they were discussing something important. I make my way towards them as well, and I greet them as soon as I get close enough.

"I see that you've made it out of there alive," I tell Peter and the king. "Does this mean that you both reached your sanctuaries in time?"

 "Actually, no," the king says. "I'm the only one who went back to his own mind. Peter is not being targeted by the ether, apparently. My guess is that ethereals must be getting special treatment when it comes to such things."
"Yeah, Flower hasn't had any trouble either, so you're probably right," I tell the king. "Hey, uh... How did it go for you?... When you reached your sanctuary, I mean. Did you lose all contact with your soul too, or can you still see things from its perspective?"

"No, I completely lost the ability to see what was happening on the ethereal plane once I got back inside my own mind," the king says. "From what I understand, this is how it's supposed to be. Your soul's aura links itself with the aura of your mind as soon as it enters its premises, and then your mind from the ethereal plane is what manages the connection between your soul and your body here on the earthen plane. What we experienced today was nothing more than an anomaly. Unless you were born as an ethereal, it's not normal to see things from the perspective of your soul. It will likely feel strange for a few more hours to not be able to switch our consciousness between planes anymore, but I'm sure the sensation will pass, and that soon our short escapade through the ethereal realms will feel like nothing more than a dream."

"Yes..." I say. "That's what I'm afraid of..."

"So, anyway... do you have any plans yet about what we're going to do with all these unconscious rebels?" I say. "Do you think there's any chance that they'll find their way back to their minds by themselves?"

"We were actually discussing that right before you joined us," Daren says. "Flower told Peter that she'll try to guide as many rebels as she can to their sanctuaries, but that she'll need a little time to rest after each trip, because she gets sick if she teleports too many times in a row. Peter will also be guiding some rebels' souls, but his teleportation spells are more limited, so he will only be flying through the ether most of the time."

"Either way, this is likely going to take a while," Peter says. "You people have already helped enough and deserve some rest. As soon as your whole group is awake, we'll talk to Breynan so he can teleport you back to the underground base. I'm pretty sure that he should still be waiting for us in the teleporter room."

 "What about you two?" I ask Peter and the king. "Won't you be coming back with us?"
"We will stay here for a while longer to guard our unconscious comrades," Peter says. "Just to be safe. You never know what enemies might be lurking just around the corner."

"Of course," I say. "I suppose it never hurts to be too careful."

As we are talking, we see Hadrik running towards us and when he spots us, he makes a quick dash in our direction, reaching us in less than a second.

"Hahaha!" Hadrik laughs. "Did you guys see? Did you see what I did to the Overseer? I mean, I guess you couldn't have seen it, but oh, man... Oh, man, the stories I have to tell you. Hold on a sec, I'm gonna take out a few bottles of dwarven ale and I'll tell you all about it!"

He then pulls out some bottles from his backpack like he said he would, and he hands them to us.

"Uh, no bottles for us," the king of the underground says. "We're still on active duty until all of our men are sent back safely to the underground base."

"Sure, no problem!" Hadrik says, as he puts Peter and the king's bottles back in his backpack. "So, anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, I was gonna start from the beginning. Let me tell you what happened right after I reached the door to the Overseer's secret base. Man, you guys are going to love this!"

I'll also be doing some guiding of my own, of course, but my progress will likely be much slower, because I'll need to fly around the ether instead of teleporting, for the most part."

"Uh, no bottles for us," the king of the underground says. "We're still on active duty until all of our men are sent back safely to the underground base."

"Sure, no problem!" Hadrik says, as he puts Peter and the king's bottles back in his backpack. "So, anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, I was gonna start from the beginning. Let me tell you what happened right after I reached the door to the Overseer's secret base. Man, you guys are going to love this!"

 We spend the next few minutes listening to Hadrik's story about how he broke through the Overseer's defenses and destroyed his core. In the meantime, the rest of our friends are awaking one by one and joining us, until Flower finally manages to guide all of our group's souls to their sanctuaries.
Once we are all assembled and Hadrik is done telling his story, Illuna joins us as well, and we are now preparing to be teleported back to the underground. 

While Peter is talking to Breynan on the transceiver, giving him an update on our current situation, I get a sudden dizziness, and for a split second it feels like my consciousness is drifting away again into the ethereal plane, where I get a direct view of the inside of my empty cube that is supposed to be my sanctuary. What just happened? Did I really switch back to my perspective from the ethereal plane for a second there, or am I just imagining things?

"You alright, Barry?" Hadrik says, when he sees me frozen in place at the back of the group, and sweating something fierce.

"You didn't... feel anything just now?" I ask Hadrik, as I'm trying to calm myself down.

"What do you mean?" Hadrik asks. "What was I supposed to feel?"

"...Nothing," I tell him. "I'm sure it was nothing. We should... probably get a little closer to the rest of the group. It will make it easier for Breynan to teleport us."

 As Hadrik nods and then walks a little closer to the others, I stand there in place for a few more seconds, contemplating on what just happened.
A fluke. It has to have been a fluke. Hadrik didn't experience anything unusual, so we're not being targeted by the Overseer again. Even if what I saw was real, I was clearly sitting inside my sanctuary, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I'm not going to get kicked out into the ether again.

After the brief pause, I decide that there's no point in dwelling on this any further, and I follow Hadrik as well, in order to get ready for our teleportation. 

"Everything is fine," I tell myself, as our bodies begin to vibrate loudly and the usual bright teleportation light envelops us all.

There is nothing to worry about. My consciousness only got sent back to the ethereal plane once, and only for one second. It was probably just a small side-effect due to my soul's prolonged exposure to the ether. I will likely forget all about this in no time, and the event won't ever repeat itself.

Everything is fine.

----Summary of the previous chapter----

After a fierce battle in the ethereal plane, Barry and his friends managed to defeat the Overseer, with a little help from the king of the underground and Peter.

Now that there is nobody left to claim the throne after the old king's death, an election is about to be held in the underground caverns, in order to establish who the rebels will nominate to be the new king of Ollendor.

----Summary of the previous chapter----

After a fierce battle in the ethereal plane, Barry and his friends finally managed to defeat the king of the underground and Peter. Once the battle was over, the Overseer's drones carried all of the unconscious rebels away from the battlefield, in order to lock them in a prison.

However, instead of sending a green-eyed drone to talk to Barry and his team, the Overseer summoned them all to the royal palace, without giving them any other options to contact him.

Reluctantly, Barry and the others started heading towards the Ollendor castle, so that they could have one last discussion with the Overseer about his plans of ruling the city, now that the rebels no longer posed a problem for him.
