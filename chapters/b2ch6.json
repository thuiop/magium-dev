She seems very pleased with herself for having managed to finally get our attention. Despite the fact that she is clearly the one who has magically suspended us into the air, her aura is showing no traces of magic whatsoever. Even when Kate and Flower hide their auras, you can still tell that they are mages if you inspect their auras very closely. The girl in front of us, however, seems no different from a regular human. This can mean one of two things. Either she is much better at hiding her aura than Flower and Kate, or...<br/><br/>\"Hey, I know you!\" Arraka blurts out all of a sudden. \"You're that stillwater girl that kept trailing behind Eiden and the fox during the still winter! Uh... what was the name?... Melenda? Milandra?...\"<br/><br/>\"Melindra,\" the stillwater girl says, in a cold voice, and then she flicks one of her fingers, casting a wind spell that closes Arraka's amulet.<br/><br/>Arraka mumbles furiously from within her amulet, but nobody is paying any attention to her. Having silenced the banshee, the stillwater girl regains her smile, and she attempts to continue her speech from where she left off.<br/><br/> \"So, as I was saying,\" Melindra says, \"there is something that I would like to ask of you. The reason why I went to watch you in the arena was because I heard that you got convicted for killing a noble from Varathia, so I thought--\"<br/>\"Hold on a second, there...\" Hadrik interrupts her. \"You're a stillwater?\"<br/><br/>\"Why, yes...\" Melindra says, confused. \"I thought that much would have been obvious by now. Even Arraka said earlier that--\"<br/><br/>\"But how did you become one?\" Hadrik asks. \"Did you get born this way? Can women be born as stillwaters?\"<br/><br/>",

I became a stillwater in the same way that everyone else did.\"<br/>\"Everyone?\" I ask. \"Even Eiden? Is Eiden an artificial mage too? Wasn't he born as a mage?\"<br/><br/>\"What is an artificial mage?\" Melindra says, in a frustrated tone. \"Eiden was born as a mage. He just became a stillwater later, just like everyone else. How is this so difficult to understand?\"<br/><br/>\"But how?\" I ask her. \"How do you become a stillwater?\"<br/><br/>\"Listen,\" Melindra says. \"If you think that I'm going to just stand here and answer every single one of your questions before you even listen to what I'm--\"<br/><br/>\"How do you know Eiden?\" Daren asks her. \"Are you working with him?\"<br/><br/>\"No, I'm not working with Eiden!\" Melindra says, visibly upset. \"If I were working with Eiden, do you think I'd need to come and ask you for help? Why can't you just shut up for ten seconds and let me finish one damn senten--\"<br/><br/> \"If you want our help, then how about letting us down first?\" Kate asks her. \"This is no way to treat someone whom you're trying to ask for a favor.\"<br/>Melindra is now looking at Kate with a pouting expression on her face that could rival Flower's, when she's upset. After a few seconds of silence, the stillwater girl waves one of her hands, and we all slowly start to descend towards the ground.<br/><br/>It's funny. This girl may well have the power to crush us with a single flick of her fingers, but her demeanor makes her feel like one of the least threatening persons I've met in my life. Perhaps even less threatening than Flower, or the ambassador of Ollendor.<br/><br/>\"There!\" Melindra says, once her levitation spell gets completely cancelled. \"You're all back on the ground. Now, can I continue from where I left off, or are you planning to interrupt me with even more questions?\"<br/><br/>",

How hard could it be to find them?\"<br/><br/>Melindra smirks at Daren, and she takes what appears to be a pinecone seed out of her pocket. She then puts the seed in her hand, and it immediately starts to glow with a bright yellow light, just like Golmyck said it would when he announced our first objectives. She then holds her hand out to Daren, inviting him to take the pinecone seed from her.<br/><br/> \"Go on,\" Melindra says, with a smile. \"Take it! You'll understand why you'll need my help soon enough.\"<br/>As Daren takes the seed from the stillwater girl's hand, the bright yellow glow fades completely, and the seed does not light back up no matter how much Daren moves it between his palms.<br/><br/>\"As you can see,\" Melindra says, with a victorious smile, \"a glowing pinecone's seeds will not light up for just anyone. They only resonate with auras that have an extremely high amount of magical power in them. If we're talking about contestants from the mage tournament, I doubt that anyone other than the four sages would have enough magical power for a pinecone to start glowing in their hands. You'd need pure blind luck to discover a glowing pinecone if you can't even make them glow when you touch them. If you don't believe me, you can pass that pinecone seed between yourselves. I guarantee you that none of you will be able to make it glow.\"<br/><br/>",

Even when they'll finally figure out what they need to do, they'll still need to go against the golden fox. Without using a detector, I can't even imagine how they'd be able to sneak by unnoticed long enough to be able to test every pinecone by hand, so they will need to engage the fox and her followers directly, and I think you can imagine how that will go for them.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, but I'm still not buying this,\" Kate says. \"You are a stillwater. Why would you need our help to assassinate a king?\"<br/><br/>\"Because I came to Varathia as a tournament participant!\" Melindra says. \"It was the only way I could think of to get back to this place after that blasted king of Ollendor exiled me! But now the tournament's spell is preventing me from hurting any of the locals, so I've been stuck here since day one, trying to find someone who can do the job in my place.\"<br/><br/> \"And what guarantee do we have that you'll fulfill your promise, once we've completed our task?\" Daren asks. \"Hell, what guarantee do we even have that you won't start acting like Eiden, and try killing us off for fun, in the middle of our journey? We already know that you've worked with him in the past.\"<br/>\"Oh, for crying out loud!\" Melindra shouts, exasperated. \"If you're so worried about my motives, then why don't you force me to take an oath? You're an enchanter, aren't you? Just make me swear that I'll fulfill my end of the bargain and that I won't try to hurt you, and we can be done with this.\"<br/><br/>\"An enchanter's oath?\" Daren asks her. \"Are you serious? You do know that you'll die if you break such an oath, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, of course I know that!\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"And you would want us to also make an oath that we won't bring harm to you during our journey?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, you don't need to do that,\" Melindra says. \"It's not like you could do anything against me, anyway.\"<br/><br/>\"Huh...\" Daren says.<br/><br/>He then turns towards us.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"What do you guys think?\" Daren asks us. \"Leaving aside her mildly infuriating, condescending remark from earlier, I'd say her deal is actually beginning to not sound so bad, all things considered. At the very least, I'm not getting the feeling that she's trying to cheat us, and we'll also get to save a kingdom in the process.\"<br/>\"Well...\" Hadrik says. \"I can't say that toppling a kingdom is something I've had the opportunity of doing before, and it would also make for a pretty good story when I'm out drinking in taverns... It certainly sounds more fun than looking for pinecones, that's for sure!\"<br/><br/>\"I'll admit that if we take everything she said into consideration,\" Kate says, \"her way of doing things may actually give us an advantage over the other participants, especially since the contest seems to have been rigged from the very beginning to only allow the four sages to move on to the next round.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, what's up with that, anyway?\" Hadrik says. \"I can't say that I was aiming to win the tournament, but this is still making me pretty pissed. Why did they even invite the other mages, if they weren't planning to give them a fair chance? Was it all just for show?\"<br/><br/> \"You are forgetting,\" Illuna says, \"that the condition for passing this round is to bring the pinecones to the city of Galamir. This means that the sages can still be attacked on their way to the city, and the pinecones can be stolen from them. So, if you are strong or resourceful enough to be able to take an item from a sage, you can still pass to the next round, even if you don't have sufficient power to make the pinecone glow. Plus, you also have the option to join the team of one of the sages, if they accept you. In other words, there's more than one way to pass this round, but they all require dealing with the sages somehow. If you want to avoid the sages, then the pinecone detector will likely be your best option.\"<br/>\"Well, I don't know about you guys,\" I say, \"but I'm personally looking forward to causing a little mayhem in the homelands of the ambassador of Ollendor. It would feel pretty good to finally get some payback after all he's put us through in the arena. And besides, Ollendor is practically going to become Leila's new home, soon, so we may as well do some cleaning up before she moves in.\"<br/><br/>Leila looks a little taken aback by my last comment. I think this is the first time when she actually realizes that she won't need to part ways with us, now that the arena is over.<br/><br/>\"You will be coming with us to Ollendor, right?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Leila writes, smiling happily. \"Yes, of course!\"<br/><br/> \"Well, if everyone's on board with this,\" Daren says, \"then we'll get started with the enchanter's oath right away. Does anyone have any suggestions for things that we should not forget to include in this oath? So far, Melindra has agreed to vow that she won't cause any harm to us, and that she won't back out of the deal after we've fulfilled our end of the bargain, but maybe there's something else we need to add, to make sure that the deal is made in good faith?\"<br/><br/>",

We'll be visiting him later today, but it's not guaranteed that he'll have them ready by the time we get there. Hold on!\"<br/><br/> Daren takes his backpack off, and he pulls a transceiver out of it, which he then hands over to Melindra.<br/>\"We'll contact you through this transceiver in case our plans change,\" Daren says. \"Don't worry about the range. It's been enchanted to cover very long distances, so we'll be able to contact you no matter where you are in the city.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, then,\" Melindra says, as she puts the transceiver in one of her pockets. \"If nothing changes, then we'll meet at the city's northern gate, as soon as the sun rises.

The king seemed rather busy, and I'm not sure how long he'll be waiting for us.\"<br/><br/> \"He told me that we should wait for about an hour before heading for the palace,\" I say, \"because he still had to arrange a few things with his army. I suggest we do some shopping in the meantime. I've seen plenty of shops while we were walking between the palace and the arena, and we won't really get any other chance to buy stuff for a very long time after we leave Thilias.\"<br/>\"Yeah, that would probably be for the best,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>",

Is it perhaps the fact that all of the banshees are practically humanoid female spirits? Or maybe the fact that female animals and monsters can still cast magic, while your women are completely unable to do it, unless their auras have been drastically altered? Oh... or maybe it's the fact that women only gain magic when they are possessed by banshees. That's a pretty big hint, if you ask me! Hell, you even had Flower as an example. Her element is fire, while Illuna's element is water. It's clear that she didn't just inherit the magic from Illuna, right? Didn't it ever occur to you that in order to channel that energy from the magical plane, you need to actually create a link with a magical spirit that is at least somewhat similar to you, in nature? You didn't seriously think that you could just pull that energy out on your own, without some magical spirit to act as a funnel for you, did you?\"<br/><br/>\"So,\" I say, \"what you are saying is that every one of the mages on the earthen plane is in fact linked with a spirit from the magical plane?\"<br/><br/> \"Well, yeah, but it's not like either of them is doing it consciously,\" Arraka says. \"Since they're on different planes of existence, the link does not need to be all close and personal. Most mages probably just link themselves to a spirit instinctively, and neither them, nor the spirits that they are linked to ever notice this for the rest of their lives. But you can't link yourself unconsciously with a spirit anymore if all of the spirits with similar auras to you are here, on the earthen plane instead. You can still try to cast magic through other means, sure, but then your aura would need to become something completely different. Like that of the stillwater girl, for example. Or that of your friend with the ice magic.\"<br/>\"But how did these spirits manage to exile you to a completely different plane of existence?\" I say. \"Surely, it can't have been as simple as just throwing you out and locking the door behind you!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, the exile was Memphir's idea, from what I've heard,\" Arraka says. \"He always did have the talent to come up with crazily elaborate plans like these, even though only half of them usually worked out in his favor in the end.\"<br/><br/>\"Memphir is the God of Fate, right?\" I say.<br/><br/> \"Yeah, the one with the illusions,\" Arraka says. \"I'm not sure how he came up with the idea, or how he managed to actually convince so many of the spirits to follow his plan, but what they basically did was to mess with the whole system that is in charge of assigning spirits to the magical plane, and they reprogrammed it in a way that assigns female spirits of the civilized races to the earthen plane instead.\"<br/>\"You can do that?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Well, obviously it's not easy,\" Arraka says. \"And you need a tremendous amount of energy to pull it off even if you figure out how to do it, but the bastards managed to rally enough of the spirits on their side to actually get the job done.\"<br/><br/>",

That's why there's this sort of... nest, or whatever you want to call it within the Magium that makes sure to pump out new spirits and to send them to the magical plane after the old ones die, in order to have roughly the same amount of spirits on the magical plane at any given time.

You can't win a fight through raw power alone. You need to have some versatility. As a generalist, Azarius can use spells of many different types, which makes his attacks a lot more unpredictable. Specialists will always be at a disadvantage when fighting against generalists for this reason. That's why I tried my best to master both enchantment and white magic, during my lifetime. Limiting myself to only one specialization would have given me far less options when fighting against other trained mages.\"<br/>\"Oh, come on!\" Hadrik says. \"It's not like Talmak can only cast earth magic. You've seen him at the last year's sage contest. He can cast lightning magic too. And a whole bunch of other spells!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Daren says. \"Basic spells. I never saw him cast any complex spells outside of his own specialization.\"<br/><br/>\"Does it matter if they're simple spells?\" Hadrik says. \"He can just use his huge energy to boost them and then they'll be just as strong as the more complex spells!\"<br/><br/> \"That would just be a waste of magical energy!\" Daren says. \"There's a reason why more complex versions of the basic spells were invented. It's because they're cost-effective.\"<br/>\"Why would Talmak care about cost?\" Hadrik says. \"He has plenty of energy to spare. It's not like we've ever seen him run out of energy in a duel before. Hell, as far as we know, his magical regeneration abilities may well be high enough that he can gain his energy back before he even has a chance to spend it!\"<br/><br/>\"Ugh!\" Daren says. \"Barry, can you believe this guy?

Eiden is also looking directly at me, with his eyes closed, but his smile is now gone from his face.<br/><br/>\"What are you getting at?\" Eiden asks me, calmly.<br/><br/> \"I'm saying,\" I say, \"that there's no way you can just build an entire civilization like that almost by yourself, and then in the span of only a few hundred years, you simply stop caring about what happens to any of these people and you kill them off like it's nothing. This is just you refusing to admit your mistakes. You failed. You had all the power in the world, but you still couldn't achieve what you wanted. And instead of manning up and trying to fix things, what do you do? You just sweep it all under the rug as if none of this was your fault, and then you decide to end everything by your own hand, as if that would somehow make it better. Stop this, already. You are only making a fool of yourself.\"<br/>\"I've heard just about enough of this,\" Eiden says, in a dismissive tone. \"You speak without even knowing the situation in which the other cities are in. Do you think that slavery and arenas are the real problems in Varathia? You have no idea what's going on in the other kingdoms. The levels to which some of these people have stooped are much lower than what you could ever imagine.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what?\" I say. \"Aren't you their leader? Isn't it the leader's job to make sure that his people don't go on the wrong path? How did you even manage to let it come to this? Did you just leave them all to organize themselves without even the least bit of intervention? Hell, even I would have done a better job at keeping things under control, and I know nothing about politics.\"<br/><br/> \"You're saying you could have prevented this if you had my powers?\" Eiden says. \"You, who could not even deliver a simple message?\"<br/>\"No,\" I say. \"I'm saying that I could have prevented this even if I had no powers at all! You, on the other hand had all the power you needed, but all you managed to do was make things worse. What was the deal with Olmnar, anyway? Did you think that by destroying that city, the fox would forgive you? Is that what you thought? Don't make me laugh! If you're seeking forgiveness, then how about you start by fixing everything you broke and by not being such a damn coward!\"<br/><br/>Once I finish my sentence, Eiden frowns, and all of a sudden, everything around me freezes, just like that time when I first fought the dragon. He then starts slowly walking towards me, while everyone except the two of us is frozen in place. He's looking pretty pissed.<br/><br/>",

I also noticed that he's been stretching his right arm to the side every once in a while ever since he stopped in front of me, but I have no idea for what reason.<br/>\"One of the benefits of being very good at reading auras,\" Eiden says, \"is that you can tell at every point during a conversation not only if a person is lying, but also if they are hesitating in some way, from the fluctuations in their aura. The fact that you were neither lying nor being hesitant at any point during your speech just now is something that I find truly fascinating.\"<br/><br/>Eiden takes a few moments to consider his next words, while he stretches his right arm to the side once more.<br/><br/> \"Here's what we're going to do,\" he says, as he closes his eyes again, and he slowly starts to walk back and forth, over a distance of a few feet. \"Whether you want to or not, this tournament is going to require you to visit a certain number of cities. You already know that you'll be visiting Galamir, and since you've met Melindra, I'm going to assume that you'll also be visiting Ollendor soon enough. There may also be other cities, depending on what the tournament's organizers prepare for the next rounds. I'm going to be monitoring your activity in these cities from afar, to see how much you can manage to change in the short time you'll have at your disposal. If you will stay true to your words from earlier, and you will indeed make radical changes through your own powers, then I will personally give you the power required to stop the calamity that is threatening these cities, and afterwards, I will leave you to shape the fate of these kingdoms in whatever way you see fit. If this unlikely scenario truly comes to pass, then I will--\"<br/>\"By the gods!\" I shout, interrupting him. \"Arraka was right! I can't believe it. You really are cheating!\"<br/><br/>\"I beg your pardon?\" Eiden says.<br/><br/> \"I just realized why you've been stretching your right arm every so often since you cast the time freezing spell!\" I say. \"And also why you've been walking back and forth for the past thirty seconds. It's because of the warning message, isn't it? I also had access to that same time freezing spell back when you powered up my stat device, so I still remember how it works! You're not allowed to move more than a few feet from your original position, so if any part of your body goes over a certain boundary, you're going to get a warning message, telling you that if you don't retreat in the next ten seconds, your spell will get cancelled.\"<br/>\"And what makes you think that triggering this warning helps me in any way?\" Eiden asks me.<br/><br/>\"It helps you,\" I say, \"because whoever designed that spell never bothered to take the actual warnings into account when calculating the duration! As long as you don't go too far beyond the boundary, and you retreat at the very end of the ten second countdown, you can practically add ten more seconds to the duration of the spell every time you do this. And since the time limit of the spell has been added by design, due to safety reasons, and not due to technical limitations, you could probably lengthen the duration of this spell almost indefinitely, if you're confident enough that you can keep it under control. So, that's what Arraka and Tyrath had been talking about all this time, when they said that you were using tricks. It's not that you don't need to obey the laws of magic because you're too powerful. You're just taking advantage of technicalities to get around the rules, and you make it seem as if it was thanks to your power all along. You're using loopholes!\"<br/><br/>",

I heard that this only happens to very skilled mages that go overboard with casting protections on themselves, without taking into account that some of those spells might actually do more harm than good, because they are in conflict with each other. If you're not careful, you could end up generating small openings in your defenses that could easily be exploited by someone that is skilled at reading the flow of auras. I could totally see Daren making a mistake like this.\" <br/><br/> \"Extraordinary!\" Eiden says, with his smile back on his face. \"I've used that trick countless times against many formidable foes in the past, and yet nobody managed to figure it out until now. However, I still do not see how this would help you and your group if you were ever to fight me seriously. Leaving aside the fact that I've had hundreds of years to learn these technicalities, even if you managed to learn them all, my level of magical power still dwarfs that of most beings on this island, with very few exceptions. I would say that you are not in a better situation now, than you were when you first met me on the second day of the tournament.\"<br/>\"Yes, I am,\" I say. \"Because now I know that you're not invincible. If you needed to learn all these tricks, then it means that your power alone was not enough to help you win all of your battles. It means that you have weaknesses.
