Once he reaches the sword, he picks it up from the ground and then he throws it in front of him again, as we're all walking alongside him on our way to the teleporter room.<br/><br/>\"It's just that you've been throwing that sword over and over for a few minutes now, and I was starting to get a bit worried about your mental state,\" Hadrik says. \"You know that you can ask one of us to hold your sword for a while if you're too tired to carry it, right?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not too tired to carry the sword,\" Daren says, as he picks up his weapon from the floor. \"I'm trying to use aura manipulation to make it fly back into my hand, like the king of the underground suggested. Why did you think I kept pointing my palm towards it every time after I threw it on the ground?\"<br/><br/>\"Is that what you were trying to do?...\" Arraka says. \"I would have never guessed in a million years. I swear, your sheer level of ineptude when it comes to anything aura related is truly a sight to behold.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, were you planning to say anything useful, or should I just ignore your mad ramblings and continue with what I'm doing?\" Daren says.<br/><br/> \"If you continue like that, the sun will die out before you make any meaningful progress,\" Arraka says. \"There's no use in expanding your aura if you don't know how to harden it. That 'king of whatever' already told you that this technique works best for items that you are familiar with, right? So instead of doing it manually, you should just try to focus on the sword's image in your head while you unleash the five flowing streams from your fingertips until you feel that they've made contact with the sword. It's as simple as that.\"<br/>\"The five flowing streams from my fingertips?\" Daren says. \"What kind of nonsense is that? Do you just make this stuff up on the spot, or what?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I don't have the patience to explain this like I'm speaking to some toddler again,\" Arraka says. \"Hey, goblin! You understood what I was talking about, right? You translate it to him!\"<br/><br/>\"Uhm... \" Kelrim says. \"I think she is referring to the tingly sensation that you get in your fingers every time when you begin to conceal your aura. If you try to remember that exact feeling and then imagine that it's coming from streams of water flowing through your fingertips, you could probably also imagine yourself 'unleashing' them like jets towards the sword on the ground. If remembering the tingly sensation is too hard, you could try to conceal your aura right now so that you get a good idea of what I'm talking about.\"<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" Daren says, as we all stop moving to get a good look at what he's doing. \"I suppose it's worth a shot. Let's see...\"<br/>He then throws his sword ahead of him again, but this time he no longer points his hand towards it. He just squints his eyes at his weapon, trying hard to focus. To all of our surprise, this time around the sword lifts itself from the ground immediately and it flies with its hilt directly into Daren's hand without him even needing to move his arm to catch it.<br/><br/>\"That was it?!\" Daren says. \"That's all I had to do? What the hell? I thought I would need at least weeks of training for this! If it's this easy, then why doesn't everyone do it?\"<br/><br/>\"It's not that easy, you dope,\" Arraka says. \"You obviously have a natural affinity for aura manipulation, or else you wouldn't have learned it so fast. If you were to ask some random mage to do the exact same thing you did just now, they would almost certainly fail. Hell, if you weren't such a blockhead when it comes to actually understanding the basics of how auras work, you might even become decently good at this.\"<br/><br/>",

Also, you are a bit slow, so there's that too.\"<br/><br/>\"Those nicknames were only examples!\" the teleporter guy says. \"And besides, how can you even be so sure that I didn't use to be fat as a kid, or that I didn't pluck my eyebrows since then?\"<br/><br/>\"Your desperate attempts at denying the truth are only making you look guiltier, slowpoke,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>",

Melindra caught my interest when she mentioned his relatively stagnant aura earlier, and I wanted to see if he was just suppressing it or if it really was something that he was born with, like he said. It was pretty obvious that I managed to both piss him off and make him lie about his old nickname when I made fun of him, but I still couldn't see any changes in his aura whatsoever. This means that he was most likely telling the truth about his aura naturally being like this, because I would have certainly noticed if he were trying to keep it stable on purpose.\"<br/><br/>\"So he was not suppressing his aura on purpose because he had something to hide from us, then,\" Illuna says. \"That's good to know.\"<br/><br/>\"Can you two lower your voices a little more?\" Daren says. \"We don't want to give away our position before we even get to the first shop.\"<br/><br/> \"It's fine,\" Melindra says. \"None of the guards are within hearing range of us, and they are not moving towards us yet.

I hope you were not kept awake by your feelings of guilt after betraying me and leaving me at the mercy of my lessathi jailor.\"<br/><br/>\"Nah, I think we're all good,\" I say. \"I was kinda hoping that you'd be deactivated by now, though.

This feature prevents you from shutting down the drones or the protocol while they are in maintenance mode, even if you are the system administrator. It is a precaution that was taken in order to avoid causing unwanted damage to the Overseer protocol by accident. Through the activation of the maintenance mode, I was able to stop Biliborrathrathsarran from shutting down most of the key aspects of the Overseer protocol, although he was still able to turn off some minor routines that were incorporated into the Overseer's personality.\"<br/>\"He removed some minor routines, huh?\" Hadrik says. \"Like... which ones, for example?\"<br/><br/>\"The routines that got removed were mostly the types that were unnecessary or purely optional,\" the Overseer says. \"Like the routine that made me want to prioritize the well-being of the citizens of Varathia. Or the routine that handled mercy.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"It is strange,\" the Overseer says. \"Even though these routines were only optional, I feel like their removal has greatly helped in making it clearer for me what my immediate goals are. For instance, now that I have come in contact with you once more, all I can think about is finding ways to make you perish. Is this what humans call having a 'desire for vengeance'?

The Overseer said that the secret shop is somewhere in this general area, so if Loyrang goes back to the surface, he'll likely be close enough to detect our auras even if we hide them. That means he will contact his buddies right away and then we'll still only have time to visit one shop. The only difference is that if we don't go to the underground herb store, we won't get to capture him.\"<br/><br/>\"This depends a lot on how much more time this royal guard plans to spend in that store, but I see your point,\" Daren says. \"Maybe we should hurry and head to the secret shop while the guard is still there. Overseer, could you show us the way?\"<br/><br/>\"Request acknowledged,\" the Overseer says. \"Come with me.\"<br/><br/>",

About forty seconds of walking later, we stop in front of a building that has a big sign on top of it saying 'Welcome to Pete's Herbal Shop. Best quality herbs in town. Now on sale!'<br/>\"This is it,\" Kelrim says. \"Let's go inside.\"<br/><br/>We walk through the door one by one, making sure to close it once we're all in. Before we get the chance to take a good look around, the shopkeeper greets us in a loud voice.<br/><br/>\"Welcome to Pete's Herbal Shop,\" the shopkeeper says. \"I'm Pete. Please take a look around. I guarantee that you won't find merchandise of better quality anywhere in Ollendor!\"<br/><br/>The shopkeeper standing behind the counter does not seem to be scared of us or be apprehensive in any way, as opposed to the other store owners we've seen through the windows on our way here. In fact, he seems to be quite excited that he finally gets the chance to sell some of his merchandise, considering how empty the streets are right now. As Daren is getting ready to address the store owner, Hadrik beats him to the punch and starts talking in a loud tone as well, to match that of the shopkeeper.<br/><br/>",

After about fifty seconds or so of walking behind the Overseer, the drone suddenly stops in front of an abandoned house that has all of its windows broken. Before we get to ask the Overseer anything, the drone begins to speak once again.<br/>\"This is where the shop entrance is hidden,\" the Overseer says. \"If you pull away that rug, you'll see that there is a trapdoor underneath it. This unit cannot fit through there, so from here on out you will be on your own. When you are asked for the password, tell the shopkeeper that the password is to 'shut his whore mouth and to open the door before you blow it open'.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure that's really a password and not just some guy you overheard threatening the shopkeeper to open the door?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>We wait for the Overseer to say something, but he remains silent.<br/><br/>\"Well?...\" Hadrik says. \"Aren't you going to answer the question?...\"<br/><br/>\"Question unclear,\" the Overseer says. \"Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol cannot provide you with--\"<br/><br/> \"Alright, alright, we get it,\" Daren says. \"Let's just go inside and we'll figure things out from there. It doesn't seem like the Overseer can offer us any more information anyway.\"<br/>With that said, Daren goes to open the trapdoor from under the rug, and this reveals a set of wooden stairs leading to a basement below the house. We carefully go down the stairs, trying to look out for any potential traps, until we arrive in front of a wall made of seredium. If what the Overseer said is true, then this is most likely the secret door leading to the shop.<br/><br/>\"Hello?...\" Daren says, in a loud voice. \"Could you open this door please?\"<br/><br/>We wait for a few seconds, but there is only silence. Seeing that the shopkeeper is not planning to answer him, Daren calls out to him again.<br/><br/>\"We know that you have a hidden herbal shop back there!\" Daren says. \"Listen, we just want to have a quick look at your wares. We have a lot of money with us. I promise we can make it worth your while!\"<br/><br/>After a few more seconds of silence, the shopkeeper finally decides to speak, with his voice being barely audible from the other side of the wall.<br/><br/>\"What is the password?\" he says.<br/><br/>",

As the shop owner is finally mustering up the courage to speak, I can't help but notice that the door to the storage room is slightly open.<br/><br/>\"D-do you have any idea what you've--\" the shopkeeper says, but his voice gets drowned out by Melindra, who is now shouting loudly while looking directly at the door on the other side of the room.<br/><br/>\"There's no use trying to mask your aura, royal guard,\" Melindra says. \"I can sense you hiding in that room behind the counter. How about you come out slowly, with your hands where we can see them, and nobody will have to get hurt?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch6_password || 0) == 3 && (locals.v_bluff || 0) >= 4) {%> <br/>\"I already gave you the password and you said it was correct,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"What?...\" the shopkeeper says in a hesitant tone. \"When did I... say anything like that?\"<br/><br/>\"It happened only a few seconds ago!\" I say. \"You said that the password was correct and that you were going to let us in. You're not seriously going to tell me that you forgot something that happened so recently, are you?\"<br/><br/>\"Uhm, no, no... Of course not,\" the shopkeeper says. \"I remember what I said. I'll let you in right away.\"<br/><br/>\"What the-- How the hell did you do that?!\" Hadrik asks me, while we wait for the store owner to open the secret door.<br/><br/>\"It's one of his new stats,\" Melindra says. \"Apparently, at a high enough level, his aura envelops his enemy and it can manipulate them into believing even the most far-fetched lies. This kind of thing will only work on people with very weak control of their aura, though.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch6_password || 0) == 3 && (locals.v_bluff || 0) >= 4) {%> \"So that's what happened!\" Daren says. \"I was wondering why it seemed like Barry's aura went through that seredium wall for a second, there!\"<br/>After a few more moments, there is a loud noise coming from above and then the seredium wall in front of us begins to get raised into the ceiling. Once the wall is fully out of our way, we enter the next room, which has many shelves filled with all sorts of plants, and also an old man with a short gray beard standing behind a counter, who I assume is the shop's owner. At the other end of the room, we can see a door, which likely leads into some kind of storage. The door is slightly open.<br/><br/>\"So, what brings you into this humble shop of--\" the shopkeeper begins to say, but Melindra interrupts him.<br/><br/>\"There's no use trying to mask your aura, royal guard,\" Melindra says. \"I can sense you hiding in that room behind the counter. How about you come out slowly, with your hands where we can see them, and nobody will have to get hurt?\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Despite the situation he is in, the man looks oddly relaxed, and his eyes don't seem to be showing any signs of hostility towards us.<br/><br/>\"You seem awfully calm for a man that has just been ambushed by a group of enemies,\" Kate says, while eying him suspiciously.<br/><br/>\"Hey, nobody says that we have to be enemies!\" Loyrang replies. \"You all seem like a smart bunch. Maybe we can cooperate!\"<br/><br/>\"You would betray your king just like that?\" Illuna says. \"Is one small threat all it takes for you to switch sides?\"<br/><br/> \"Sure, why not?\" Loyrang says, while still holding his hands above his head. \"It's not like I have any attachments towards the king or any of the people in this city. I'm a tournament participant like you, remember? I'm only in this for the money. If there's no longer any profit in it for me, I may as well cut my losses. You want information, right? I can give it to you for free! It's not worth much to me anyway, since I'm probably going to skip town as soon as things start to get heated up.\"<br/>\"Hmm...\" Melindra says. \"I'm not fully sure, but from what I can tell of his aura, he seems to be telling the truth.\"<br/><br/>\"You were planning to desert your post all along?...\" the shopkeeper asks him, perplexed.<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" Loyrang says. \"Why did you think I came here in the first place? I wanted to stock up on some rare herbs before I left.\"<br/><br/>\"Is Gontrok in on this too?\" Hadrik asks. \"Is he also planning to betray the king and leave the city?\"<br/><br/>\"Nah,\" Loyrang says. \"Gontrok has other plans. He wants to become the king's most trusted man, so that he can eventually manipulate him into attacking and conquering the other kingdoms of Varathia. When we first came in here, he told me that it disgusts him how all these technologically advanced relics are being wasted on defending the city, when they could be used for so much more.\"<br/><br/> \"I suppose that does make sense, given Gontrok's personality,\" Hadrik says.<br/>\"Never mind Gontrok's motivations,\" Daren says. \"Tell us something that can help us beat the royal guards! What do you know about their plans?\"<br/><br/>\"Plans?\" Loyrang says. \"What plans? The king put the ambassador from Thilias in charge of all the strategies. That guy's a moron. The only thing that he actually organized is the order in which the guards are raiding the civilian houses. He has no real strategy for when we're supposed to fight you, and the captain can't even keep half of his current troops under control. In all likelihood, Gontrok is probably going to charge ahead like he always does, and the others will need to rush after him to back him up. Aside from this, it all depends on how well you'll match up against each individual royal guard. I mean, you already saw how well you handled yourselves against Gontrok and the captain, so I'm not exactly sure what you're expecting to accomplish.\"<br/><br/>",

We either tie him up or we let him go. I'm not accepting any other options.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine, fine!\" Melindra says. \"You don't need to be so dramatic about it. I was only making a suggestion. So, what's it going to be, then? Let him leave or tie him up?\"<br/><br/>",

First of all, on a scale of one to five, how would you rate your interactions with the Overseer so far?\"<br/><br/>\"Can we choose 'zero' as a rating?\" Hadrik says. \"Because you sure as hell haven't given us any useful information since the first time we met you.\"<br/><br/> \"Your complaint has been noted,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol will do its best to improve the quality of its interactions in the future. Here is the second question. When the Overseer protocol warned you yesterday that there would be 'no turning back' once you decided to ignore my directions, would you say that the intent behind this statement was sufficiently clear for you to understand?\"<br/>\"...If I say 'no', will that stop you from trying to kill us again?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Negative,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol will still send its drones to kill you once the survey is complete.

I wouldn't want to risk her getting hurt when we have other alternatives.\"<br/><br/>\"Even if she were to hold it for only twenty seconds, it could still be enough for us to shake off these drones,\" I say. \"I'll tell Rose to not overdo it, and to only hold the spell until she begins to feel slightly uncomfortable. Just a second. I'm calling her now.\"<br/><br/>I then take out my transceiver, I make sure that the dial is set to Rose's number and I tap the device once.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Rose, are you awake?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I was cooking,\" Rose says. \"Anything wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"Sort of,\" I say. \"We're being chased by some drones and we could use some help.\"<br/><br/>\"...Drones?\" Rose asks, confused. \"What are 'drones'?\"<br/><br/>\"I'll explain later,\" I say. \"For now, could you freeze time for anyone except us, like you did yesterday? We don't need you to hold the spell for thirty seconds again, but even twenty seconds could make a huge difference.\"<br/><br/> There is no answer coming from Rose. Is she already trying to cast her spell, or did she simply not hear me?<br/>\"Umm... Rose, are you trying to freeze time now, or--\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the drones above us freeze in mid-air, and everything else stops moving except our group.<br/><br/>\"This is perfect!\" I tell Rose. \"Just keep it going for a few more seconds, and we'll be--\"<br/><br/>I don't get to finish my sentence, because the drones begin to move again, mere seconds after Rose initiated her spell.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry!\" Rose says. \"I'm sorry... I don't think I can do any better than this. I woke up with a big headache this morning, and it's keeping me from being able to concentrate.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry about it,\" I say. \"We're the ones who woke you up with that call about the herbs. I should have told you to go back to sleep instead of keeping you awake. You still bought us a few seconds, so we'll try to make the most of them. Talk to you later!\"<br/><br/>\"Bye, and be careful!\" Rose says.<br/><br/>\"Well, the drones are still closing in, so I guess it's time for plan B,\" I say, as I tap the transceiver and put it back in my pocket while we run.<br/><br/> \"I'm on it!\" Hadrik says. \"You guys go on ahead without me. I'll catch up to you in a sec.\"<br/>Hadrik then turns into an eagle and flies towards one of the red-eyed drones in the sky. Once he reaches it, he turns back into a dwarf and he kicks it in its eye, sending it crashing into the ground.<br/><br/>\"Great...\" Kate tells me, as we are still moving towards the shop. \"Now he's going to try and stop those drones by himself. You do realize that he has no chance of taking them all out on his own, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, but at least he's durable enough that we won't need to worry about him getting hurt,\" I say. \"He will destroy as many drones as he can, and we'll just have to deal with what's left.\"<br/><br/>\"Something tells me that what is left will be the majority of the drones, but there's no use complaining about it now,\" Kate says. \"Let's try getting as close as we can to the shop before we are ambushed.\"<br/><br/>",

Even though we appear to be doing a pretty good job of keeping our enemies at bay, there's still a large number of drones coming our way, which means that we can't really move from our position and because of this Daren and the others are getting further away from us the more we fight. Fortunately, I see Daren waving at me from a distance, and once I wave back, he goes inside one of the buildings along with Kelrim, Leila and Hadrik.<br/>Perfect. Now that I know where the shop is, we can keep fighting these drones without any worries of getting left behind.<br/><br/>We keep on shooting the metal balls for a while longer, until a certain moment when they all stop attacking us all of a sudden and they retreat in unison. We choose to be thankful for this turn of events and instead of chasing after them, we fly towards the herbal store, so we can meet up with Daren.<br/><br/>By the time we arrive, it seems that Daren has already finished his shopping, because he is now coming out of the store and so is everyone else.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_combat_technique || 0) >= 2) {%> <br/>\"I think she might be right, Hadrik,\" I say. \"Her attacks are much better suited for these types of enemies.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright, fine...\" Hadrik says. \"In that case, I'll move to the front of the group and try to destroy the metal balls that block our path.\"<br/><br/>\"Melindra, let's go,\" Kate says, as she conjures an ice platform below her feet.<br/><br/>\"...You do realize that I still don't have full control of my powers, right?\" Melindra says. \"I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to hold the barrier against all these drones.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sure you'll do fine,\" Kate says. \"Come on, get on the platform.\"<br/><br/>Melindra shrugs, and then she gets closer to Kate, as the two of them are now raising themselves higher into the air to fight the drones.<br/><br/>\"Let's keep moving,\" Daren tells us. \"Kate and Melindra will follow us from above.\"<br/><br/>After we run for a few more seconds, I take a glance upwards to see how Kate and Melindra are doing.

Is that it?\"<br/>\"Negative,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol has been ordered to pull back all of its units. Your completion of the survey will not result in any harm towards you or your team.\"<br/><br/>\"How do I know that you're not just lying to me?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"The Overseer protocol is not designed to tell any outright lies,\" the Overseer says. \"The only things I am capable of doing are to withhold critical information on purpose and to mislead people through omission of important facts.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine, I get it,\" I say. \"So, why did you receive the order to retreat, exactly?\"<br/><br/>\"The information you requested is not available at this time,\" the Overseer says. \"Please try again later. Also, this is a reminder that you still haven't completed the survey. If you no longer remember the question, a simple yes or no will suffice.\"<br/><br/>",

Even though it's still technically written in the Common language, if you've never learned how to write like this, you would have no chance of understanding it. <br/><br/>I have no idea who taught Pete to write like this or why he would choose to use this peculiar writing style on the labels from his shop, but at least now I can figure out what plants are on these shelves. Alright, let's see what we have here... On the top shelves we've got ambermayn pistil, drawsnap seeds, treddil roots... Then we have dragon claw, dragon fang, dragon tooth... Damn, whoever was tasked with naming these herbs must have really given up halfway through, huh? <br/><br/>Okay, on the other shelves we have mistwatchers, dawnbloomers and... summerglow grass? Yeah, I read that right. There's definitely some summerglow grass on one of these shelves. And quite a lot of it too.

You've more than paid for their value already.\"<br/><br/>\"Well...\" Hadrik tells Daren, as Pete is now grabbing the summerglow grass. \"There goes all the money I saved you. I still don't get why you couldn't just settle for those replacement herbs he brought you.\"<br/><br/>\"Because they were only replacements,\" Daren says. \"I had no guarantee that they would work as well as the real thing.

Daren's transceivers are the only ones powerful enough to function properly through such a thick layer of seredium, and even they work inconsistently, as far as I've seen.\"<br/><br/> \"I could try calling this friend of yours with my transceiver, but I'm not sure if it will do much help,\" Daren says. \"My transceivers are designed to work well in pairs due to the special frequencies they are each using, but whenever I try to use them on regular frequencies, they don't work much better than the normal transceivers you can buy on the market.\"<br/>\"It's fine...\" Kelrim says. \"Let's just try calling Barry again directly. If at least one of these calls gets through, maybe we'll still have a chance to get out of here.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, I'd say we should be far enough now from where we were previously,\" Daren says, as we all stop moving. \"I'm trying to call him again.\"<br/><br/>He then taps his transceiver once more and puts it close to his mouth.<br/><br/>\"Barry, can you hear us?!\" Daren shouts loudly.<br/><br/>\"Barry, we could really use your help right about now!\" Kelrim says.<br/><br/> \"Hey, Barry!\" Daren shouts again.<br/>\"Barry, why aren't you answering them?...\" we hear Albert's calm voice coming from Daren's transceiver all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"Albert?...\" we hear the teleporter guy's voice this time around. \"I didn't see you entering the room!\"<br/><br/>\"Of course you didn't,\" Albert says. \"I'm an assassin. I came here to see if there were more refugees needing guidance and what I found instead was you staring at a transceiver while people's screams were coming out of it. Mind telling me what's going on?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the teleporter guy says. \"I think there is a spell of some kind cast on their area which is interfering with their signal. I can't get a good lock on them with the teleporter, and they don't seem to hear me even if I've been trying to contact them for many minutes now.\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, we can hear you now!\" Daren says. \"We moved to a different spot, and I think the signal might be better here.

Ever since then, I've been trying to be more careful about my decisions, but--\"<br/><br/>\"You've been trying to be more careful about your decisions by... asking Arraka how to kill a god and then convincing us all to go along with your crazy plan?...\" Daren asks me, perplexed.<br/><br/>\"Aside from that!\" I say. \"Look, the point I'm trying to make is that I know I can make some really, really insane decisions sometimes, but I'm trying to improve, and I'd appreciate it if you guys helped me out with that. In other words, if you hear me coming up with a dumb plan in the future, just smack me over the back of the head or something. That way I'll at least know to tone it down a bit.\"<br/><br/> \"Barry...\" Hadrik says, as he puts his hand on the side of my shoulder. \"I want you to know that you can definitely count on me to smack you over the head as many times as you consider necessary. Not because I'd enjoy it, but as a favor to a friend!\"<br/>\"Perfect!\" I say. \"So, on that note, I just came up with this idea of how we could gain an advantage over the royal guards in the upcoming fight. If Melindra were to cast her air currents on me again, I could fly ahead and bait some of the enemies away from you guys by shooting crossbow bolts at them from the air. As long as I can keep their attention on me long enough, you guys could gang up on the remaining guards and take care of them while I--\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, I feel the familiar and nostalgic sensation of a cold, hard icicle smacking me over the head from behind. When I turn around, I see that Kate is still holding the icicle in her hand, looking at me with a disapproving expression on her face.<br/><br/> \"I should have known that you couldn't keep talking for more than a minute without saying something really stupid,\" Kate says. \"We already talked about this once. We're not splitting up. We will fight the royal guards together. Is that understood?\"<br/>\"Yes, ma'am!\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Kate says, as she makes the icicle in her hand disappear. \"Let's get ready, then. I'm beginning to sense Gontrok's aura too, now, so he must be getting close.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, well, Gontrok eventually decided to sprint ahead of the others, like last time,\" Melindra says, \"which means that he will be the first one to attack us. He'll be coming from over there, so I recommend that you prepare yourself, Hadrik.\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... guys, just one question before we begin the battle,\" Kelrim says. \"When you said earlier that you were planning to fight a god... that was only a figure of speech, right? You weren't being serious?\"<br/><br/>We all stare at the goblin, not sure exactly what to tell him.<br/><br/>\"Guys?...\" the goblin says, looking a bit more frightened, after he sees that we're not answering.<br/><br/>\"Ahahahahaha!\" Arraka laughs. \"Figure of speech, he said. This goblin is way too funny. You people should keep him as a mascot. Ahahahaha!\"<br/><br/>",
