We've been steadily approaching the city of Ollendor for these past few days, and according to Melindra we should be reaching our destination tomorrow, before noon. While we've been travelling, we all tried to avoid speaking about the rituals we went through as much as possible, and we did our best to act as if nothing had changed. However, even if on the surface our discussions didn't seem much different from before, it was becoming clearer with every passing day that each one of us had been affected in some way by the God of Time's trials.<br/><br/>This is probably also the reason why most of the people from our group eventually agreed with my idea of having Arraka train us to defeat Selkram. Some were more reluctant than others, but in the end the only two persons not officially participating in our daily meetings were Leila and Melindra. Considering that Leila will be remaining in Ollendor with her father and that Melindra will no longer be travelling with us after she will be done with her oath, it is probably better that way. Arraka's plans seem like they will be taking a lot of time to accomplish, after all.<br/><br/> \"I still can't believe that we're actually having these meetings with Arraka...\" Daren tells me, as we slowly climb towards our meeting spot, which is located on top of a small hill near our camp. \"If you had told me a week ago that I'd ever agree to do something like this, I would have laughed in your face.\"<br/>\"It's not like we have much of a choice,\" I say. \"You said it yourself. We don't have any kind of experience in dealing with gods. The only one in our group who has ever fought against them on equal terms is Arraka. If it were only up to us to make a battle plan, we wouldn't even know where to begin...\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, yeah, I get it,\" Daren says. \"It's just that it feels weird, you know? It was not so long ago that she tried to kill us. Actually, what am I saying? She did kill us, before the time got reversed. And now she's suddenly acting as our coach? Why would she agree to any of this? It's all a bit fishy, if you ask me.\"<br/><br/>\"She does have her own beef against the gods, though,\" I say. \"They're the ones who banished her from the magical realm, remember? Of course she'd want to get back at them in any way she can. And since she's been trapped in an amulet for decades, we're the best chance she's got.\"<br/><br/>",

There's still a chance that this is just one of her usual schemes, and she's making us waste our time for her own amusement.\"<br/>As we finally reach the top of the hill, we see that everyone except me and Daren was already there, waiting for us. It looks like Leila and Melindra have decided to join the meeting as well, even if they are only participating as spectators. Leila has also spectated our meetings the last two times, but Melindra didn't bother to join us until now. I guess that curiosity must have finally gotten the better of her when she saw that these training sessions were actually becoming a regular thing, instead of us just giving up after the first two tries.  <br/><br/>\"You're late!\" Arraka tells Daren and me, as we are approaching her and the others. \"The penalty for tardiness in my class is twenty push-ups.

Can you do that, at least?\"<br/><br/>\"No, of course not!\" Hadrik says. \"All we can tell from an aura is how much magical power someone has. We mostly just use this sense to figure out where our enemies are, and if they can cast any magic.\"<br/><br/>\"That's it?...\" Arraka says, shocked. \"Well why the hell didn't you say that from the beginning? That changes everything! What you morons need to be doing first is basic aura training. Start with breathing exercises and work your way up from there. Seriously, how could you even get to this level of magical proficiency without mastering the basics? With your levels of magic power it should be an elementary task to figure out someone's age. Just focus on the small, rotating, currents right above a person's head. The ones that give off a cold vibe, even if they look like they're letting out steam. You won't see them on your first try, but if you look really carefully, you'll notice that they are masked by a sort of waterfall that is blocking your view. Obviously, when I'm telling you to look carefully I mean with your magical sense, not with your eyes...\"<br/><br/> \"That description sounds even worse than the ones you gave us yesterday!\" Hadrik says. \"How do you even make this stuff up?\"<br/>\"Yeah,\" Daren says. \"If you ask me, she's probably doing it on purpose, in order to make it-- wait a minute...\"<br/><br/>He then gets closer to Flower, in order to have a better look at Arraka's amulet.<br/><br/>\"Did you just say something about a waterfall?...\" Daren says, as he looks at the amulet intently.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, the age is hidden right behind it,\" Arraka says. \"You need to imagine yourself passing through the waterfall and grabbing the rotating currents between your hands, until they stop moving. That's when the age number will become clear enough for you to read.\"<br/><br/> \"Hahahaha!\" Hadrik laughs. \"Daren, did you hear that? I think she wants you to go for a swim!\"<br/>Daren does not say anything, and he keeps looking straight at Arraka's amulet in deep concentration.   <br/><br/>\"Daren?...\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"No, no, no, this can't be right...\" Daren tells Arraka, after a short while. \"It tells me here that your age is negative three hundred fifteen. Unless I'm supposed to decipher it or something, this number doesn't tell me anything.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't read my age, you dope!\" Arraka says. \"I'm hiding it on purpose, so people can't tell exactly how old I am. I've also taught Illuna to do the same. Read somebody else's aura. Like that of the ice mage. Or that of the mute girl. Neither of their ages is hidden in any way, and they should be easy for you to see.\"<br/><br/>",

Kate is a relatively powerful mage and she would probably benefit from learning this stuff, but I'd prefer it if she focused on the tasks I gave her instead, since our time is limited. Illuna more or less knows the basics already and Flower didn't exactly learn them, but she can figure out some of the stuff at first glance, likely as a result of being an ethereal. And as for the mute girl... uh... Leila was her name, right? Anyway, so I think Leila may already know quite a bit more than the basics, since she's able to tell from your auras if you are lying or not. That's a pretty rare ability to have, even for a lessathi, so as far as aura reading skills go, she's on another level compared to you lot. I'm not sure if this is a result of many years of practice, or if she's just particularly talented in this field, though.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not really all that talented...\" Leila writes. \"A lot of the time I fail at calling people's bluffs, even after reading their auras. It's only for people that are very easy to read, like Barry, that I always manage to tell if they're lying or not.\"<br/><br/> \"The mute girl brings up a good point,\" Arraka says. \"Barry, your bluffing skills are simply abysmal. Your face and your tone of voice might not give you away most of the time, but when you lie about something, your aura just shakes like crazy. If you don't do something about this problem of yours, you might risk giving us away to Selkram before we even get the time to put our plan into motion. Get control of your aura, already!\"<br/>\"And how would you expect me to do that?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"By investing some points in your Bluff stat, obviously,\" Arraka says. \"Do I really need to tell you everything?\"<br/><br/>\"My... Bluff stat?...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, the one that helps you keep the flow of your aura calm, even when you tell a bald-faced lie,\" Arraka says. \"It's literally called 'Bluff'. You can't miss it.\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" I say. \"I don't have a bluff stat on my stat device! And neither does Leila!\"<br/><br/>\"What?...\" Arraka says. \"No, that can't be right. You must be looking in the wrong place or something. Give me that stat device of yours. Bring it close to my amulet, so I can study the magical particles on its screen properly. I'll find that stat for you.\"<br/><br/>",

But he's obviously not the first one to have invented this technique. Many others have come up with similar techniques in the past, which have more or less the same purpose. Never mind that, though. I think I may have found a new task for you and Leila. I'm guessing that you still haven't made any progress towards unlocking your Magical Power and Magical Knowledge stats, but maybe you'll have more luck if you try to unlock your aura stats. You should get Daren to help you too, since he's an enchanter. But make sure that you don't tamper with your device too much.

Once they find this out, it's going to be complete chaos! All of the gods and powerful spirits in the magical realm will start fearing for their own existence, and they will try to rid themselves of both Selkram and Ulruk. This would also force the God of Fate to pick a side in this conflict, and while Memphir may not care much about the God of Time, he most certainly couldn't just turn against the God of Death right in the middle of their alliance. Thus, the three gods would have no choice but to form a new alliance, while making enemies out of every single spirit in the magical plane.

If Daren could use even half of those fancy moves, it would be a huge improvement.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch1_unlock || 0) == 0) {%> \"Okay, but what about Hadrik, then?\" Melindra says. \"What would he have to gain by contacting his spirit?\"<br/>\"Nothing,\" Arraka says. \"But that's not the point. What matters is that WE would have something to gain by him contacting his spirit.\"<br/><br/>\"And why would that be?\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Arraka says, \"the second and much more important reason why we want to get in contact with a spirit from the magical plane is that we want to set up a little conflict between the God of Time, the God of Death, and all the other spirits.\"<br/><br/>\"A conflict?...\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Mhm...\" Arraka says. \"See, I'm not sure how much attention you've been paying to my discussion with Selkram, but one thing I mentioned when I was talking to him was that I figured out he also tried to absorb other spirits, just like me, in order to gain more power. He failed miserably, and obviously never attempted anything like that again after the first few times, but the other spirits don't know that. In fact, the others likely don't know anything at all about the fact that he and Ulruk tried to absorb spirits, because if they did, they would have tried to throw them out of the magical plane, just like they did with me. It doesn't look like any of the spirits figured out that the multiple voices Selkram and Ulruk gained when they talk are coming from the spirits they absorbed incorrectly, but that would change if I could somehow come into contact with one of the spirits on the magical plane, and spill the beans.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch1_unlock || 0) == 0) {%> \"But would they believe you?...\" Melindra says.<br/>\"They would be forced to believe me if I gave them enough proof,\" Arraka says. \"And since I'm the one who invented the technique, I obviously know exactly what they need to test for, in order to convince themselves that the voices are indeed coming from badly absorbed spirits. Once they find this out, it's going to be complete chaos! All of the gods and powerful spirits in the magical realm will start fearing for their own existence, and they will try to rid themselves of both Selkram and Ulruk. This would also force the God of Fate to pick a side in this conflict, and while Memphir may not care much about the God of Time, he most certainly couldn't just turn against the God of Death right in the middle of their alliance. Thus, the three gods would have no choice but to form a new alliance, while making enemies out of every single spirit in the magical plane. The God of Storms and the God of the Seas would most definitely be leading the charge against them, and there are some strong animal and monster spirits too, that could pose quite a challenge for our godly trio.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Nevertheless, Memphir would almost certainly be forced to join the side of the outcasts, so the most likely scenario is that there would soon be a very long lasting all-out war between the God of Fate, the God of Death, the God of Time, and every other god and spirit in the magical realm. Although I wouldn't put it past the God of Fate to manage to get a few of the other gods on their side even in a situation like this. He's always been a crafty bastard.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, so if the other gods and spirits will be doing our work for us, why are we still training to fight against the God of Time, then?...\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"They won't be able to take those three out so easily,\" Arraka says. \"If even I wasn't able to kill them, then the other spirits won't be able to do it either. At most, we can hope for a stalemate. But there's no way Selkram can come out unscathed after a battle like that. He will be greatly weakened, and that's just what we need.\"<br/><br/> \"I still don't get why Daren and I are the only ones trying to talk to our spirits, though,\" Hadrik says. \"Shouldn't everyone be involved in this, if it's so important? I'm pretty sure that both Kate and Leila have better magical sense than I do.\"<br/>\"And who would they contact, you moron?\" Arraka says. \"Kate is an artificial mage, so she isn't connected to any spirits, and Leila isn't a mage at all. You and Daren are the only ones in this group who are linked to any magical spirits. Well, technically Flower is linked to Illuna, I guess, but she's not in the magical plane, so she doesn't count.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, but I was saying that they should try to contact our spirits, instead of theirs,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"It doesn't work that way,\" Arraka says. \"I already told you yesterday. You need to contact them by yourselves. If somebody could have done it from the outside then I would have done it myself, since I can already see those damn invisible strings tying you to your spirits as clear as day! Anyway, we're just wasting time arguing about this. Let's move on with the rest of the meeting. Kate, what's your status? Did you manage to magically sharpen your icicles enough to affect those targets I gave you?\"<br/><br/> \"No, the icicles just keep passing right through them,\" Kate says. \"I tried sinking a lot of my magical energy into my projectiles to make them as powerful as possible, but it's still not having any effect, no matter how hard I try.\"<br/>\"It's not the power that you need to be focusing on,\" Arraka says. \"It's the sharpness. Let me explain. Those targets I made for you were created from a substance that is similar to the 'solid light' that makes up Selkram's energetic body. In order to be able to directly affect something like that, you need to focus less on the physical aspect of your ice, and more on its aura. When you magically sharpen your projectiles, what you are doing in fact is that you are sharpening the auras of your icicles, not the icicles themselves. It's the same when you use magical sharpening for any other elements. And if the aura is sharp enough, it can affect even a body that is made almost entirely out of energy. That's why no matter how powerful or fast you make your projectiles, it has no meaning unless their aura is good enough.\"<br/><br/>",

With Selkram, it's going to be way harder than that. Of course, if Melindra were to join us too, things might get a lot simpler. I'm pretty sure that her wind blades are more than sharp enough to destroy my targets, and with a little guidance from me, she might even be able to cut through actual solid light in a matter of days. What do you say, Melindra? Wouldn't you like to take some sweet, sweet revenge on the God of Time after all he did to you?\"<br/><br/>\"I already told you that I'm not interested,\" Melindra says. \"I only came to this meeting out of curiosity, not to join you in your plans. I don't have a death wish, unlike the rest of the people here.\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"But...

You could try punching some of Kate's targets to see how well you're doing, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. So, let's see who was next on the list... I already confirmed that Barry and Leila haven't made any progress in unlocking the stat device's magical stats, so I guess that leaves us with Flower and Illuna, but I already know their progress since I'm always hanging around their neck. Flower, you should just keep focusing on sharpening your element, like Kate. Illuna, you could do that too, but I think you should keep working on those techniques I've taught you, back when I was still your mentor. Sharpening your element will come much more naturally, once you've practiced those techniques well enough.\"<br/><br/> \"I will keep that in mind,\" Illuna says.<br/>\"Alright,\" Arraka says. \"So we've got Barry who's working on unlocking his magical stats, we've got Kate, Flower and Illuna who are working on their elemental magic, and we've got Daren, whose enchanted sword may well be the only weapon somewhat capable of harming the God of Time right now, but who can't even defend himself from someone throwing a pebble, without covering himself in heavy armor... I love it! This team is so beyond hopeless that if you people actually end up killing Selkram, it would be the most hilarious thing to have ever happened in all of the history of the magical and earthen planes combined. I mean, just imagine the humiliation Selkram would be going through in his final moments, after being beaten by this group of pushovers! I am trembling in excitement at the very idea of it!\"<br/><br/>",

We're all on the same team, remember? But yes, it most definitely has been a while since I've put so much effort into a plan like this. It feels almost as if I were back in the magical plane, hatching one of my grand schemes to take down the gods and their allies. Of course, things would be going a hell of a lot smoother if I didn't have to carry all this dead-weight with me, but beggars can't be choosers, am I right?\"<br/><br/>\"Hey,\" Hadrik says. \"I'll have you know that one of these dead-weights you're talking about is going to be the future winner of the Magium tournament!\"<br/><br/>He then turns to me, with a grin.<br/><br/>\"Isn't that right, Barry?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/> \"Huh?... Oh, yes... Yes, of course!\" I say, in a slightly hesitant tone, as Kate turns to look at me, suspiciously.<br/>\"Uh-huh,\" Arraka says. \"The winner. Right...\"<br/><br/>She remains silent for about two seconds, and then she continues.<br/><br/>\"So anyway, there is much more I'd like to discuss with you all about Selkram and his weaknesses, but like I said before, our top priority at the moment should be to get in contact with one of the spirits from the magical plane. Therefore, I will spend the remainder of this meeting trying to teach Daren and Hadrik the basics of auras, in the hopes that we can actually make some meaningful progress, this time around. Everyone else is dismissed. You can go tend to your own tasks regarding Selkram, or whatever it is you want to do. Daren, Hadrik, come over here. We've got work to do.\"<br/><br/>As everyone is moving away from the meeting area, I get ready to leave as well, but just as I take my first step Kate places herself in front of me, blocking my path, while looking at me with a very serious expression on her face.<br/><br/>",

If that were true, then you might have a greater chance to get some real use out of the Magium than the mages that joined the tournament.\"<br/>\"Yes,\" I say, \"but I used to think that the Magium was the source of all magic. In that context, it wouldn't have been unrealistic to assume that I could use it to make me into a mage. But now that I've seen what the Magium is capable of... I'm not even sure if I want to use it anymore. Just the thought of going back into that world is making my hair stand up on the back of my neck.\"<br/><br/>\"Then don't use the Magium,\" Kate says. \"You already have the solution to your problem right there, in your pocket. You can use your stat booster to become a mage. You only need to find a way to unlock your magical stats, and then you won't even need the Magium anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"That would only work while I'm here, in this tournament,\" I say. \"Once there will no longer be mages around me to power up the device, the energy will slowly deplete by itself, until the stat booster will become completely unusable.\"<br/><br/> \"But what if you tried to use the knowledge from the Magium to alter your stat device?\" Kate says. \"From what Arraka said, I'm guessing that it's somehow possible to access the Magium even if you don't enter its world. Surely, amongst all that knowledge, there would also be a way to make your stat device gain its energy directly from the magical plane instead of getting it from other mages, don't you think?\"<br/>\"I... think you might be right!\" I say, as I suddenly jump up from the rock I was leaning against. \"Yes... Why didn't I think of that? Even without knowing what exactly the Magium is, I still should be able to at the very least get some knowledge from it. And given my advantage of being a half-lessathi, I might actually be able to make my own version of a stat device, with enough practice. That's brilliant!\"<br/><br/>\"So, should I take it that you've now gained back some of your motivation for winning this competition?\" Kate says, as she raises an eyebrow, while still leaning with her back against the rock.<br/><br/>\"Yes, definitely!\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Kate says. \"Maybe now you'll be able to finally focus more on our goals, than on your own internal turmoil.

It's not like we've been travelling together for a lifetime, so that we'd be comfortable enough to talk about this sort of stuff without hesitation. And besides, most of the people in our group are either the types that don't like to burden other people with their problems, or the types that don't want to appear weak by showing they can be affected by such things. If we're ever going to have heart to heart discussions about how these rituals impacted us, it will probably happen slowly, and only after everyone has already managed to deal with their problems by themselves.\"<br/>\"I guess you're right,\" Leila writes. \"Not everyone is going to be comfortable opening up to people they've only known for a short while. But perhaps these things will change, with time...\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"Anyway,\" Leila writes, \"I think we should start working on your stat device. Maybe we'll get lucky and actually make a bit of progress today, before we go to sleep.\"<br/><br/> We spent the next two hours trying to fiddle with my stat booster, in order to see if we could somehow unlock the three hidden aura stats that Arraka told me about during our meeting. Given that we didn't want to disturb Daren during his training session with Arraka, we initially tried to make do with the enchanting tools we had already gotten from him two days ago, when we started working on figuring out the secret code required to activate the magical stats. Once Daren came down from the hill, however, we asked him if he could give us some more appropriate tools, because the ones we were using before were better suited for our previous task of cracking codes, and not so useful for our new goal of finding hidden menus.<br/>With the help of Daren and with Leila's knowledge of magical devices from her father, we eventually managed to discover the hidden menus that Arraka was talking about, but now we were facing a new challenge, as the only method Daren and Leila could come up with for unlocking these hidden stats was a risky one, which may even render my device completely useless if we got unlucky.<br/><br/> \"No matter how long I think about this, I'm not seeing another option,\" Daren says, as he is holding two sharp metal tools in his hands, using them to manipulate the aura around my stat device. \"I'm not sure if Leila's father could come up with a better idea than this, but I can't think of any other way of unlocking these extra stats than to break the seal placed on them by force. The problem is that if there is some sort of security measure in place to prevent such a thing from happening, your stat device may go into an emergency lockdown mode which could completely prevent you from using your regular stats until the lockdown is deactivated. If that happens, then fiddling with the device further without having a very deep understanding of how its mechanisms work could cause it to break completely. Maybe it would indeed be better to wait for Leila's father and see if he has some other ideas, before we go any further with this plan.\"<br/><br/>",

He is sitting on the ground at the base of the hill, in a place where we can oversee our camp without being too far away from it, so that we would be able to reach the tents quickly in case of an emergency.<br/>\"Hold on, Barry,\" Daren tells me, just as I reach him. \"Could you stand in place there for a few seconds and not move? I'm trying to test something.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, sure, I guess...\" I say, as I stop moving and look at him confused.<br/><br/>He then stares at me for a while, with a very concentrated look on his face.<br/><br/>\"Alright, now turn around,\" Daren tells me.<br/><br/>\"Okay...\" I answer him, as I do what he says.<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Daren says, after another few seconds. \"Could you turn around again, but this time from the side?\"<br/><br/>",

When I told him I'd do anything, I thought he'd jump right at the opportunity, but he gave me the power just like that, without asking for anything in return. Actually no, he did ask for something... He asked me to 'prove him wrong'. What do you suppose he meant by that?\"<br/><br/>\"He was almost certainly talking about your previous argument with him,\" I say. \"Don't you remember? When you first met, you told him that there is still some good worth fighting for, and that as long as you don't give up, you will find a way to right the world's wrongs. That was what started your whole feud with him. So maybe after he saw you throwing yourself on your hands and knees in front of your worst enemy just for the sake of saving one slave girl, he might have had a slight change of heart. When he asked you to prove him wrong, I think he wanted you to show him through your actions during this tournament that there is indeed still hope for humanity like you said, and that he made a mistake by giving up on all humans the way he did.\"<br/><br/> \"No...\" Daren says, in disbelief. \"That can't be what he meant. Eiden has lost his humanity a long time ago. He might have had good intentions at some point, but that was hundreds of years ago! You've seen the way he acts. He considers humans to be nothing more than insects. He even said this himself. There's no way he'd be having second thoughts now, after all this time.\"<br/>\"Are you sure about that?\" I say. \"Because if we are to judge him by how he reacted when I told him I'd save all the cities in Varathia, I'd say the situation might be quite different. I think that deep down he wants to be wrong, but it's way too late for him to turn back now. That's why he is giving us one last chance to do what he couldn't do, before everything goes down the drain, for good.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, boy...\" Daren says. \"I had completely forgotten about how you said you'd solve all of Varathia's problems by yourself too. Between winning the tournament, killing the God of Time and saving the cities, you sure have a busy schedule ahead of you, don't you, Barry?...\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, you know me!\" I say, trying to appear as confident as possible. \"It's all in the day's work!\"<br/><br/> \"What the hell?...\" Daren says. \"Did you hit yourself in the head or something? I could swear that I heard some hesitation in your voice just now!\"<br/>\"What are you talking about?\" I say. \"Of course I wasn't hesitating! I never hesitate. Maybe you're the one who hit himself in the head, instead of me.\"<br/><br/>\"Right...\" Daren says, as he looks at me suspiciously. \"Listen, if you think that your plan of fixing all the problems in Varathia is too reckless, then you don't have to go through with it. We already know from the prophecy that we will have the possibility to save the cities from destruction either way, so you don't need to rely on Eiden's generosity. In fact, it might be better if we didn't take his word for granted at all, because who knows when he might change his mind... And even if you are right about him and he does truly wish to be wrong about his stance on humanity, I don't think he will make life any easier for us when we walk through those cities. In fact, I am almost certain that he will be doing everything he can to make things as hard as possible for us, in order to both 'test' us and amuse himself at the same time. We might be better off just focusing on the prophecy for now, and dealing with the cities after one of us gains access to the Magium.\"<br/><br/>",

I did not need to ask Melindra for a closer look at the rock, because she rotated it in all the possible angles while showing it to Flower, which gave me more than enough time to read the text on it. Apparently, the symbols were written in a very old dialect of the goblin language, and the meaning behind them was: 'The password is griffin beak.'<br/><br/>The words didn't exactly tell me anything, but who knows?

        "text": " \"Well, if worst comes to worst, Melindra could just fly us over the walls like she did in Thilias, right?\" Hadrik says. \"It's not like a few crossbowmen are going to stop us.\"<br/>\"We should be in sight of the city walls in a few minutes, and then you'll have your answer,\" Melindra says. \"Now please stop talking so I can focus on these rocks. I want to finish showing them to Flower before we reach Ollendor.\"<br/><br/>We do as Melindra says and we keep quiet for the next few minutes, until she is done showcasing all of her rocks. After she puts them in her backpack, Melindra tells us that we will be seeing Ollendor as soon as we pass the line of willows in front of us.<br/><br/>\"So, do you all remember when I told you that in Ollendor, they are still preserving old relics from the lessathi empire's days of glory?\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, you did say something like that when we were in the second stage of the God of Time's ritual,\" Daren says. \"Why do you ask?\"<br/><br/> \"Well...\" Melindra says, and then she pushes away the willow branches in front of us, so we can get out of the forest.<br/>What we see when we walk out of the woods stuns us briefly, as we all just gaze in complete shock at the city that can be seen in the distance, in front of us. Just like Melindra told us, it looks like the ruins of the black seredium towers that used to gather magical energy for the old lessathi empire are still being preserved, but what she omitted to tell us was that they are apparently still functional, even in this state of decay.<br/><br/>In a similar fashion to how it all worked five thousand years ago, these towers have flying platforms on each side of them which carry mages across their various levels, and on top of each of the ruined towers there is a purple-colored yarn of magical energy that is moving chaotically in every direction. Someone must have restored these towers somehow, but not to their full functionality, because their size is at least four times smaller than the towers we saw during the ritual, and the energy they are radiating is nowhere near as impressive as the one from five thousand years ago.<br/><br/> That being said, it looks like even this smaller amount of energy is more than enough to power up all of the magical contraptions they could possibly need. The air above the city is being filled with flying metal vehicles, the large holographic screens in the sky that we saw in the old lessathi empire are also present, and aside from all that, there seem to be quite a few twenty-foot tall metal golems that are patrolling the area around the city, ready to attack any unwanted intruders. As we look at the city in front of us with our jaws dropped, a lonely bird innocently tries to fly over the walls, so it can get to the other side.<br/>Just as it passes the wall, one of the golems immediately turns its head towards it, and it sends a huge beam of fire flying out of its mouth which incinerates its target instantly, leaving only ashes in the air where the bird once was.<br/><br/>While the rest of us are simply staring in front of us in disbelief, it is Hadrik who breaks the silence, by asking Melindra a question.<br/><br/>\"So...\" Hadrik says. \"I'm guessing that's a 'no' on the plan to fly us over the walls, then?\"<br/><br/>",
