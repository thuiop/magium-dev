And now that the time limit is drawing closer, the so-called 'God of Fate' even went as far as forming a temporary alliance with the 'God of Death', saying that he'd help him with his indiscriminate murders, as long as they were being focused on Varathia!

After a few more seconds, the God of Time reverses time once again, to make sure that he doesn't kill her by accident, and he continues to squash her, over and over again, like before. <br/><br/>\"Oh, no...\" Arraka says. \"Not the time reversals again...

As soon as the light disappears and I can see around me again, I notice that I'm still lying on the ground, but everyone else is gone. <br/>Wait, no, that isn't right... It's not that everyone else is gone. It's that I've been transported to an entirely different place. I am still in the middle of a forest, somewhere, but this forest seems awfully familiar. As if I've been here before, in my distant past.<br/><br/>When I decide to get up and explore a bit, I am momentarily frozen in shock, as I realize that my height is now considerably lower than it was before. And it's not only my height, that's different, either. My arms are also much shorter, my hands are smaller, and I'm no longer wearing the same clothes.<br/><br/>\"--these rituals of his always change, but there should almost certainly be some time-travelling involved,\" I hear Arraka's voice in the back of my head, as I suddenly remember what she was saying to me earlier. <br/><br/>Time-travelling, a smaller body, and a familiar-looking forest. I'm getting a bad feeling about this.<br/><br/>I immediately check my pockets, to see if I still have any of my old items, but they are all gone, including my stat device. If this is really the forest I think it is, and if that strong, magical aura I'm feeling in the distance also belongs to whom I think it does, then the God of Time must have sent me back to when I was around thirteen years of age. But for what purpose?...<br/><br/> I throw all those thoughts away, and I start running as fast as I can, towards the house that I once used to call my home. I say that I'm running towards my house, but truth be told, my home used to be more of a cabin, really. It was made almost entirely of wood, and it was somewhat isolated from the rest of the village, because my father liked the quiet. We had a river close to us, and we could get all the firewood we needed from this forest, so we were somewhat independent of the other town folk. We even had a small patch of land, that we were farming, and a barn, where we kept our hay. It's funny how I can still remember all of these details so vividly, when I haven't thought about this place in many years.<br/>As soon as I reach the edge of the forest, I take a look towards the old cabin, and my heart skips a beat, when I see my little sister in the middle of our front yard, just as the banshee within her is awakening, and preparing to take over her body. That powerful magical aura radiating from her is just as sinister as I remembered, and it's sending shivers down my spine. Not only is my sister's aura changing, but her body is also transforming into something that could no longer be called human. Her face looks like it's melting, and her skin is turning purple, while the rest of her body is getting slowly deformed.<br/><br/> As the donkey in front of our barn is making loud and scared noises, my parents and my little brother are just coming back to the house, and they're rushing towards the yard, to see what is happening to my sister. They're still alive... My parents are still alive. This time I didn't arrive too late. I can still save them. I can make things right. I can-- wait... what about that trial the God of Time was talking about? Is saving my parents part of the trial, or am I supposed to be doing something else?<br/>No... To hell with that trial! I'm being offered a once in a lifetime opportunity to fix my past mistakes. I'm not going to throw it away. This time, I won't be too late. This time, I'm going to save them all.<br/><br/>",

The banshee was trying to impale my father with her bare hand, but due to my intervention, she only managed to lightly wound me in the left side of my abdomen, instead.<br/><br/>My mother gasps, as she sees the blood, dripping out of me.<br/><br/>\"Barry!\" she shouts, with fear in her voice.<br/><br/>I do not give the banshee the time to attack me again, and I run my pitchfork straight through her chest, while holding the weapon with both my hands. The banshee screams in a very loud and shrieky voice, but she doesn't manage to muster the strength for another strike, and after a few more seconds, her screams and her squirming all come to an end, along with her life.<br/><br/> As I drop the pitchfork from my hands, along with the banshee's body, my mother comes to hug me tightly, and then she just holds me in her arms for a few seconds, without saying anything.<br/>\"Thank you...\" my mother says. \"Thank you so much for saving him. I can't even imagine how it would have been to lose both my daughter and my husband in the same day.\"<br/><br/>She then retracts all of a sudden, as she takes a look at my wound.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry,\" she says. \"I shouldn't have been pressing on your wound like that. I'll go get some bandages and some rubbing alcohol from the house. It looks like it's only a surface-level wound, so it should be enough to clean it up a little. I'll be right back!\"<br/><br/>She then rushes towards the house, as my father is still apparently in a state of shock from what happened, and my brother is crying in the background.<br/><br/>",

Now, as long as I can figure out what the God of Time's ritual is, and how to survive it, I should be able to--<br/>My thought process gets interrupted by an extreme dizziness, as the entire area gets flooded with a bright white light again.

My magical sense is enough to give me all the information I need. The aura of the banshee possessing my sister is just as strong as it was the first time I was sent back in time. I can also sense that my parents and my little brother have not reached our house yet. I can sense it all.

I did everything perfectly this time around. I didn't get wounded, I didn't interact with either of my parents, and I killed the banshee before she even had the chance to complete her awakening. This has to be what the ritual wants from me, right? Otherwise, why would it have sent me here?<br/><br/>\"Barry...\" my mother says, with tears in her eyes. \"What have you done?\"<br/><br/>When I look at the ground, to see the corpse of the banshee I killed, I notice, to my shock, that her body has reverted to the original form that my sister had, before the awakening began. As my mother grabs the lifeless corpse of my sister tightly in her arms, my father is looking at me with nothing but contempt in his eyes, as a silent fury is slowly taking over him.<br/>\t<br/>\"You killed her...\" my father says. \"You killed her in cold blood.

I WANT him to know. Barry... I want you to remember what I'm about to tell you, for every single day that you'll be spending rotting away in prison. You are NOT our son. You never were. Your real parents were a couple of outsiders who moved into our remote village less than a year before you were born. They were both murdered in broad daylight, a few years later, by some hooded thugs that somehow managed to then vanish without a trace, and since there was no one left to care for you, Helen and I decided to take you in. But we only did it out of pity, and because nobody else wanted you. Do you understand?! Nobody wanted you! Nobody wanted--\"<br/>The last words of my father's sentence were completely drowned out by the sound of my mother slapping him very hard across the face.<br/><br/>\"I said that's enough!\" my mother says, as she looks at him with a determined look on her face, while she wipes a tear from her eyes.<br/><br/>",

We all could feel the powerful and unnatural magical aura coming from your sister just minutes ago, and we could see from a distance what monstrous form she'd taken, before you killed her. I... don't know anything about magic, and neither does your father. But you were always fascinated by it, and always took every opportunity you had to learn more about it.

That's just the story that I've been telling everyone for the past fifteen years. I've been telling it for so long, that I've even managed to fool myself into believing it was real. But the reality of these events was in fact far different from what I remembered. Now I understand what this ritual wants from me. Now I finally get what I need to do.<br/><br/>As the realization of what really happened all those years ago finally dawns upon me, I first experience a feeling of shock, then, a feeling of resignation, and finally, a feeling of hatred. A feeling of pure hatred towards the God of Time, which only keeps intensifying as I walk through the forest.<br/><br/>When I finally reach the edge of the woods, I go inside the barn to pick up the pitchfork, and then I head towards my parents, who were now trying in vain to talk with the being that was once my sister. I position myself at a safe distance from my parents, and I wait.<br/><br/> After a few more seconds, the banshee finally awakens, and she tries to impale my father with her bare hand. Amazingly, my father manages to dodge her first attack, so the banshee attacks him a second time, by driving a sharp cone of rock through his leg, making him fall on the ground, as he screams in pain. The banshee is now screaming as well, seemingly because she is also in pain, as a result of straining herself so hard, immediately after her awakening. While the banshee is distracted, my father finally notices me, and he also sees the pitchfork that I am holding in my hands.<br/>\"Barry...\" my father says. \"Quick... Throw me the pitchfork!\"<br/><br/>I say nothing to my father, and I continue to stare at him, while I keep cursing the God of Time in my mind, more and more, with each passing second.<br/><br/>\"Barry!\" my father says, this time in a more desperate tone. \"There's no time! You need to give me the pitchfork!\"<br/><br/>Unfortunately for him, the banshee had already recovered, and she was preparing for a third, and final attack. My father could not do anything to escape, due to the large wound in his leg, and he was impaled once more, this time through his chest, which killed him almost instantly.<br/><br/> My mother screams in terror, as she sees my father die before her eyes. She is now much too scared to move, but before her dying moments, she manages to utter a few last words.<br/>\"Barry, please... save me...\" she says.<br/><br/>Just like before, I do not move from my spot, I do not answer her, and the banshee kills her by slitting her throat, with a dagger made of sharpened rock. When the banshee sees me just standing there, looking at my parents' corpses, she begins to laugh. The exact same sinister laughter that I remember clearly to this day. And now I finally know what she was laughing about. She wasn't laughing because she enjoyed killing my parents. She was laughing at me.<br/><br/>It wasn't that I arrived too late. That was never what happened. I was there when my parents were being attacked. I saw it all happen before my eyes. I had the pitchfork in my hands, ready to strike, but when I got closer to the banshee, and saw her monstrous figure staring at me with that vicious look in her eyes, I simply froze. I completely froze, in fear, and I couldn't even hear my father and mother begging me to help them. It was only when my little brother was almost about to get killed by the banshee as well, that I finally mustered up the courage to attack her. That is what really happened, fifteen years ago, and what I've completely blocked from my mind for more than half of my life.<br/><br/>",

Hadrik, Kate and Daren are also here, apparently, but they are not saying anything.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_both || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_ch11_saved_slave || 0) == 3) {%> \"First, let me give you a bit of context!\" Arraka says.<br/>\"What's happening?\" I say. \"How did you bring us here?\"<br/><br/>\"Shh...\" Arraka tells me.<br/><br/>\"Rose,\" I hear Daren saying. \"Could you show me to my room?

But why are you showing me this? Does this have anything to do with Daren's ritual?\"<br/><br/>\"I told you,\" Arraka says. \"I'm trying to give you some context! It wouldn't be any fun otherwise. Alright, next up, we'll fast-forward to Daren's room.\"<br/><br/>Once again, the whole scenery around us changes in an instant, and we both find ourselves inside Daren's room from Rose's mansion, where Daren is currently sitting on the bed, with his torso leaning forward, and his elbows propped on his knees, while he is holding his head with both his hands.

Almost immediately after we arrive in this place, we can hear the scream of a young boy, echoing somewhere in the distance, and then we hear a little girl, screaming in pain as well, although she appears to be somewhere closer than the boy. Not long afterwards, we start to hear the terrified screams of a few other children, as well. Some of them are begging for mercy, some of them are trying to suppress their screams, and others are calling in vain for their parents to save them.<br/>I've heard the stories about this place from both Kate and Leila, but I never would have imagined it to be as bad as this.

I know it may not seem like it, most of the time, but I rarely do things without a reason. For example, I specifically chose this moment in time as our initial destination, because I knew they were going to be doing experiments at this hour, and there would be a lot of screaming going on. It just would have felt like a waste if I kept you waiting in a silent, empty hallway, you know?\"<br/><br/>\"Ugh...\" I say. \"Just shut up and get us out of here, already.\"<br/><br/>\"Easier said than done,\" Arraka says. \"I may be a genius when it comes to magic, but you still can't expect me to comb through all of these events that have been happening here in a matter of seconds. It's not like I get to connect myself to the Magium like this on a daily basis.\"<br/><br/>\"You keep casually talking to me about the Magium, but you haven't even told me what it is, yet!\" I say.<br/><br/>\"That's the joke, Barry-boy,\" Arraka says. \"I keep doing it because I know it frustrates you. It's a good way to keep myself from dying of boredom, while I go through the tedious process of scanning these memories.\"<br/><br/>\"Can you at least tell me how you are able to switch between past and future with so much ease?\" I ask her. \"And how is it that you can also access people's memories, and transport us into them as if they were a part of our reality?\"<br/><br/> \"When you're linked directly to the Magium in the way we are now,\" Arraka says, \"terms like 'past', 'future', 'memories', and 'reality' become irrelevant. In here, everything is both real and imaginary at the same time. Allow me to demonstrate!\"<br/>A giant, red serpent, with two wings, and four small claws suddenly appears in front of me, and it immediately flies towards me, with a menacing look in its eyes, while its whole body is surrounded by flames. I panic a little, and I jump back, trying to pull my dagger out, but the monster scratches my right leg with one of its claws, and then it disappears just as quickly as it made its appearance.<br/><br/>\"Arraka, what did you do?\" Flower asks, shocked, as Illuna approaches me, in order to heal me.<br/><br/>\"Relax!\" Arraka says. \"Neither of us can die in here.

Our real bodies are still right where we left them, stuck in one of those weird trances with the glowy eyes. What I was trying to show you was that I can do whatever I want, while we're in here. It's like my own playground. Obviously, I can't interfere with what your friends are doing, since we don't really exist in their worlds, but as far as spectating goes, my options are unlimited.\"<br/><br/> \"So, you're saying that my friends can't die either?\" I say. \"They're just in an imaginary world, right now?\"<br/>\"No, this only applies to us, because we are projections, like I said,\" Arraka tells me. \"The worlds that your friends have been transported into are very much real. It's just that they're not OUR world. They are parallel worlds, similar to ours, in which the future never actually happened. Obviously, none of the changes that they make in those worlds will affect our world in the slightest, but they have no way of knowing that. Didn't you find it strange that you managed to pass your own ritual even if it should normally have been impossible for you to perfectly reproduce the exact actions you took fifteen years ago, down to the last detail? That's because it wasn't the laws of time preventing you from doing what you wanted. It was just Selkram, messing with your head.\"<br/><br/>\"The God of Time...\" I say, as I am suddenly filled with uncontrollable hatred, just by uttering his name. \"Is he watching us, right now?\"<br/><br/>",

That's why he usually only comes in at the very beginning, and at the end, unless it is absolutely necessary for him to personally intervene in the middle of a ritual. Otherwise, he'll mostly just stay in the magical plane, and wait patiently for the rituals to gather energy for him.\"<br/>\"But how do these rituals help him?\" I say. \"What is it about these trials that give him so much power?\"<br/><br/>\"He's gathering energy from your negative emotions,\" Arraka says. \"Hatred, anger, fear, despair... that kind of stuff. Those are the types of emotions that can be exploited in the most efficient way, through these methods. But he can't really do any of that without linking himself directly to the Magium, during the time weaver prophecies, so he needs to squeeze as much as he can out of you guys, while he still has the chance. That's why these trials are designed the way they are. To make sure that they trigger as many strong negative emotions out of you as they can.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not sure if I like where this is going,\" I say. \"Just what kind of messed up trial is this guy trying to put Kate through, if he needed to send her all the way back to her years at the Beacon?\"<br/><br/>\"We will both see in a few seconds,\" Arraka says. \"I never actually looked at this ritual before I came here with you, so we'll both be experiencing this for the first time, together. I'm sure it will be fun. Let us begin!\"<br/><br/> We both disappear from the corridor with all the screaming, and we reappear in a dark, empty room where an eleven year old version of Kate seems to be talking with what I'm assuming is a twelve year old version of her friend, Diane. Kate is easy to recognize, because she just looks like a smaller version of her usual self, but Diane has long, blond hair, and a much more frail physique than she had, in her adult form, so it's a bit more difficult for me to tell if it's really her or not. They are both dressed in rags. The room we are in resembles my old holding cell from the arena, with one bed and a small window on top, so I'm guessing that they are most likely in Diane's room, and Kate decided to pay her a visit, in order to tell her something that she knows from the future.<br/>\"I didn't manage to make her thoughts audible, so we're going to have to work with what we have,\" Arraka tells me. \"Let's see where this goes.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm telling you, it's not the test of loyalty!\" Kate tells Diane, while whispering, in order to make sure that the guards outside don't hear them. \"I know that it's hard to believe, but I've come from the future, and I know that the lessathi caretaker who is trying to help us escape will become Leila's adoptive father later on. I know that he can be trusted!\"<br/><br/>",
