Is there really a plan to make when we don't even know the Overseer's full capabilities in this plane of existence?\"<br/>\"I wasn't saying that we should anticipate the Overseer's every move,\" the king of the underground says, \"but we should at the very least know what each of us can do before we head into battle. We don't want to risk getting in each other's way by accident before we even begin to fight, do we?\"<br/><br/>\"I suppose you're right,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Would you perhaps care to go first?\" the king of the underground says. \"I'm assuming that there must be some special reason why you are the one accompanying your ethereal friend and not any of the powerful mages in your group, correct?...\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yeah,\" I say. \"It turns out that being a mage doesn't really help you to cast magic on this plane of existence unless you're an ethereal or a being from the magical plane. I, on the other hand can cast a fair amount of spells in this plane, thanks to the extensive amount of knowledge in the field of magical theory that I've gained throughout my life, due to my never-ending quest of trying to become a mage.\"<br/><br/>\"Fascinating...\" the king of the underground says. \"It's not that I don't believe you, but could you perhaps demonstrate a few spells for us so that we can have a general idea of how this works? Do your spells function in the same way as the ones on the earthen plane?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" I say, \"they're mostly the same, except for the fact that I need to know the flow of magic and the theory behind each spell perfectly, or they'll fail to cast. Let me give you a few examples.\"<br/>After I stop talking, I begin to cast one basic spell from each element, to give them a little taste of what I can do. Once I'm done showing off, the king of the underground spends a few moments contemplating on what he's just seen before he speaks again.<br/><br/>\"Given the variety of the spells you've just shown us, am I to understand that you are the equivalent of a generalist on this plane?\" the king of the underground says. \"How many more spells do you know?\"<br/><br/>\"It's hard to say,\" I answer him. \"There are some spells that I've already tested, so I know that I can cast them here, but for many others it's going to be a gamble. I know the theory behind too many spells to be able to test them all, and I can't be sure that I can cast a spell in this plane successfully before I try it and see how it works. One thing I can tell you for certain is that my stat device will not work here, because I'm not carrying it with me on the ethereal plane, so the only thing I can rely on is my magic. Oh, and I might also be able to use the multi-step dispelling technique that I invented while I was apprenticing under Brinhorn, now that I think about it. That should be simple enough to do even in a place like this.\"<br/><br/>\"Multi-step dispelling...\" Peter says, as he is trying to comprehend what I've just said. \"You mean the Brinhorn dispelling technique?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, that's the one,\" I say.<br/><br/> \"What do you mean you invented it?!\" Peter snaps, all of a sudden. \"Are you insane? Brinhorn was the one who invented it, not you! It's even in the name!\"<br/>\"Well, yes, he asked me if he could name the technique after himself and I said that I didn't mind,\" I say. \"I've met hundreds of Barrys in my lifetime. There really wouldn't have been much point in naming that technique after me.\"<br/><br/>\"You are delusional,\" Peter says. \"And you expect me to believe that Brinhorn even considered accepting you as an apprentice when you couldn't cast any magic at all? This is beyond ridiculous!\"<br/><br/>\"Now, now, Peter,\" the king of the underground says. \"I will admit that what he told us is a little hard to believe, but he did just show us that he can cast a wide variety of spells in this realm, so that does lend a bit of credence to his story.\"<br/><br/>The king now turns towards me.<br/><br/>\"Either way,\" he continues, \"I believe that we should now know enough of your capabilities to work around them. Peter is a generalist as well, so I'm sure that the two of you will get along just fine.\"<br/><br/>",

He said that he's trying to fix the issue, so maybe we should give him some time to do just that.\"<br/><br/>\"You are suggesting that we should let our enemy do exactly what he wants?...\" Peter asks.<br/><br/>\"I'm saying that I'd rather take my chances with whatever his experimental procedure is supposed to be, than have to fight him while he's still releasing those waves of energy at us,\" I answer him. \"There's no way we can defend ourselves against something like that without the hardened aura shields.\"<br/><br/>\"And after the shield breaks?\" Peter says, as another shockwave hits the king's invisible barrier, generating a few more cracks. \"What then?\"<br/><br/>\"Then we'll have Flower teleporting us far away from here, and we won't come back until we have a proper plan,\" I say. \"There's no point in continuing to fight a battle that we know we can't win. Or at least I think there's no point. I'm still a little new to this whole 'trying not to be needlessly reckless' thing.\"<br/><br/> \"Fair enough,\" the king of the underground says. \"For now, let's wait until my barrier gives in completely, and we'll see where we go from there.\"<br/>We wait in silence for the next shockwaves to come, while we watch more and more cracks forming in the invisible barrier in front of us. After taking two more direct hits from the Overseer's energy waves, the invisible shield finally breaks, leaving us completely defenseless.<br/><br/>\"Okay, that's it,\" I say. \"Flower, get ready to teleport us somewhere far awa--\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you for your patience,\" the Overseer says all of a sudden, as the weird noises that it was making until now are finally stopping. \"The issue has been resolved. The experimental procedures will now continue as scheduled.\"<br/><br/>\"So, umm... just out of curiosity...\" I tell the Overseer, \"these experimental procedures of yours wouldn't happen to include any more of those deadly shockwaves, would they?\"<br/><br/>\"Negative,\" the Overseer says. \"The disintegrating shockwaves were never a part of the original planned procedures.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, that's great!\" I say. \"At least we can rest assured that there won't be any more instant death scenarios right off the--\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, watch out!\" Flower shouts, and she teleports me away, as a huge disintegrating beam that got suddenly fired by the green-eyed drone was just about to reach me.<br/><br/> \"The Overseer protocol is pleased to announce that its first test of the disintegrating beam is a success,\" the green-eyed drone says, once it is done with its attack. \"We will now be commencing the second phase of testing, which will involve firing more than one beam at the same time. To ensure the most optimal testing conditions, please remain stationary so that the drones can hit you more easily. Thank you in advance for your continued cooperation.\"<br/>As the Overseer is saying this, a few dozen red-eyed drones are appearing out of nowhere throughout the ether, completely surrounding us. I quickly use my air currents to dodge one of their disintegrating beams and then I destroy two of the drones with a lightning spell, so that I can fly past them.<br/><br/>\"Everyone scatter!\" I shout at the others, as I make my way out of the perimeter that the drones were surrounding. \"We need to divide the Overseer's attention as much as we can! And don't stop moving even for a moment!\"<br/><br/>\"We already know what we need to do,\" Peter says, as he takes out four drones by himself with an ice spell and then flies away from his other attackers. \"None of us were born yesterday.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" I say, as twenty drones suddenly materialize all around me, blocking my every possible path of escape.<br/><br/>",

I can do that.\"<br/><br/>\"Then do it,\" the king says. \"I will shield your flames with my aura manipulation technique as soon as you create them.\"<br/><br/>\"Roger that!\" Flower says, and then she creates her flames in front of her, waiting for a drone to attack her.<br/><br/>\"Kill every drone that isn't directly in front of her,\" I tell Peter, as I fly towards Flower and begin destroying several drones with my spells. \"She needs to keep all her focus on her flames.\"<br/><br/> As Peter and I are busy fighting the drones, Flower and the king of the underground manage to position the aura-shielded ball of fire exactly in the path of one of the incoming disintegrating beams. Just as the black beam engulfs the flames completely, the king cancels his hardened aura shield and the flames quickly begin to absorb the black energy of the beam from the inside, until all that is left is a ball of pure black fire, of the likes that I've never seen.<br/>\"Black flames...\" Peter says while looking at the black ball of fire, in awe. \"So, it can be done...\"<br/><br/>\"Flower,\" I say. \"Hurl those flames of yours at the green-eyed drone, will you? That should get his attention.\"<br/><br/>When the green-eyed drone sees the black flames heading in its direction, it immediately places five red-eyed drones in a straight line in front of it so that they can block the incoming attack. This strategy does not pay off in the slightest, however, because the flames simply pass through the metal balls, obliterating them instantly just by touching them.<br/><br/> \"Warning! Warning! Warning!\" the green-eyed drone says, as it begins to fly around in circles, while being chased by Flower's black fire. \"The danger levels have crossed all acceptable thresholds and therefore the first experimental procedure must be canceled prematurely. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we will begin the second experimental procedure ahead of schedule.\"<br/>\"Second experimental procedure?...\" I say. \"What second experimental--\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Flower's ball of fire turns back to its normal orange color, while the red-eyed drones disappear, and now a very large blue summoning circle is starting to form below us.<br/><br/>\"Oh no,\" I say, as we're all getting away from the blue light that is quickly beginning to envelop the area. \"Oh no, no, no... Please tell me this isn't going to be another red-eyed mammoth.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " My question gets answered very soon, when a forty foot tall monstrosity begins to slowly materialize in front of us. As I take a good look at it, I realize that I am at a bit of a lack of words for describing it, because I've never seen anything like it before. What is it supposed to be exactly? A flying hydra? A seven-headed dragon?<br/>It doesn't have any legs, like a dragon would, but the wings are exactly like those of a drake, and its heads all have different colors. The colors are red, green, yellow, dark blue, light blue, white and brown. Actually, now that I take a better look at it, it's not just the heads that have these colors, but the entirety of the snake-like creatures coming out of the main body, while the body itself has more of a light red tint to it.<br/><br/>I've researched many creatures before joining this tournament, both mythical and non-mythical, and I'm quite certain that nothing close to this has ever come up during my studies. Could this be the Overseer's own original creation?<br/><br/>\"Experiment number two,\" the Overseer says. \"You are right now looking at a being that had the potential to exist on the earthen plane but never came to be, due to a multitude of unfortunate factors. It has no official name, so you can call it whatever you like. If you survive the experiment, the Overseer protocol would very much like to hear your first-hand impressions of the creature, as the information would be particularly valuable.\"<br/><br/> \"Oh yeah?\" I say. \"Well, how about you take your information, and shove it up your... green eye socket... or whatever else would make sense in this context since you don't actually have an--\"<br/>I do not have the time to finish my sentence, as one of the hydra's heads breathes fire in my direction, and I am forced to get out of its way. Right after that, one of the other heads shoots a beam of ice out of its mouth, forcing Flower to fly away as well.<br/><br/>As I was looking at the flying hydra, I could not help but notice that the fire came out of the red head, while the ice came out of the head with a light-blue color. There's also the fact that the number of heads which the hydra has is exactly the same as the number of magical elements that exist in the world, if you also count the non-traditional ones like acid, ice and electricity. Surely, this can't be a coincidence, right?...<br/><br/>\"Guys, I'm not sure if you've figured it out already, but I'm gonna say it anyway, just in case,\" I say. \"I think that this hydra's heads might each represent a different element, and that we should be able to tell which one is which by their colors.\"<br/><br/> \"I think you might be right,\" Peter says, as he is looking very attentively at the seven-headed hydra that is at the moment just staring at us menacingly. \"If we go by simple logic, my guess is that dark blue means water, white means air, green means acid, uh... yellow means...\"<br/>\"Yellow is probably lightning,\" I say. \"We already saw what red and light blue are, so that only leaves brown as earth.\"<br/><br/>\"An earth-breathing hydra head?...\" Peter says. \"What kind of nonsense is this?\"<br/><br/>\"Look, it doesn't matter if it breathes earth or not,\" I say. \"The important part is that it will likely be doing something earth-related. And now that we know all this, it should be easier to fight it, since we already know what a hydra's weaknesses are. If it's like a normal hydra, then we could try to chop all its heads off at once, burn it with fire, or stab its heart. Either one of these options should work, hopefully, but we should probably stick to just one for now.\"<br/><br/>",

Maybe you could give me a hand, Peter?\"<br/><br/>\"If you think I'm going to risk cutting a hydra's heads off based purely on your anecdotal evidence, then you are out of your mind,\" Peter says. \"Burning it with fire is obviously our safest bet.

        "text": " \"Processing... Processing...\" the Overseer says. \"Insufficient data available. The Overseer protocol requires more encounters with the mysterious being that just contacted us in order to properly assess its threat level. The experiments will continue as scheduled, until a final conclusion has been reached.\"<br/>\"Are you insane?!\" Peter asks the Overseer. \"You want to challenge what could possibly be the ether itself just because you don't have... enough data?\"<br/><br/>\"Please remain calm,\" the Overseer says. \"The experiments will not be conducted in ideal conditions if you do not retain complete control of your mental faculties.\"<br/><br/>As the Overseer finishes its sentence, twelve of the hydra's heads begin to roar loudly and menacingly. The only two heads that remain silent are the brown ones, which are simply watching each one of us in turn, looking as if they were trying to choose their next target.<br/><br/>\"Well...\" I say, as I get in a stance and begin to make a few hand gestures in quick succession. \"If fire doesn't work, then we might as well try electricity.\"<br/><br/> I then point my finger towards the hydra, and a bolt of lightning shoots out of it, straight for the monster. Just like with the fire, the hydra seems to feel the pain of it, but aside from that, it doesn't look like my attack is having much of an effect on the creature except for making it target me next.<br/>I anticipate its teleporting attack and dash backwards by using my air currents, but immediately after its teleportation, the monster sprays acid with both its green heads in all of the area around me. Even though I manage to create a dome of rock just in time to protect me from the brunt of the attack, the acid is very quickly eating through the rock, and the hydra seems to be pouring more acid at a faster rate than I can reinforce the stone.<br/><br/>\"You're covered!\" the king of the underground says, as he makes a very tall invisible shield between me and the hydra that is stopping the rest of the acid from reaching me. \"Now get away from there!\"<br/><br/>\"You don't have to tell me twice,\" I say, as I quickly fly backwards, until I am out of range from the hydra's breath attacks.<br/><br/>While I am distancing myself from the monster, I feel my consciousness being sent back to the earthen plane a few more times, but this time things are happening a little differently. Instead of switching perspectives between the two planes of existence, I am beginning to become aware of my surroundings in both planes simultaneously. <br/><br/> The only other occasion when I experienced something similar to this was when the Magium tried to erase me and Leila from existence in the seredium tower. For now, my main consciousness still seems to be in the ethereal plane, but at the same time I am also in control of my real body from the earthen plane, except that it doesn't really feel like my body at the moment. It feels more like some kind of... puppet... that I'm controlling with invisible strings.<br/>Come to think of it, I remember Flower saying the same thing about her own body on the earthen plane. That it feels like she's controlling a puppet. Could this be how Flower has been living her life this whole time?<br/><br/>While I am busy contemplating my own existence, I suddenly detect a good number of red-eyed drones approaching me on the earthen plane, as I am still lying on the ground in the middle of a puddle. When I finally get up, I see that the king of the underground is awake on the earthen plane as well, and he is right now raising himself into the sky, so that he can fight the drones.<br/><br/>\"You too?\" I ask the king of the underground, realizing that I am not the only one whose consciousness is constantly switching between planes.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the king answers, simply, and then he flies higher into the sky.<br/><br/>",

Flower told me that your fight in the ethereal plane is still not over.\"<br/>When I turn around, I see that Flower has flames in her eyes on this plane of existence as well, except that in here they are currently blue, because Illuna is the one controlling her body.<br/><br/>\"I think the ether might be attacking us,\" I say. \"Some mysterious voice in our heads told us to stop fighting and return to our 'sanctuaries', but the Overseer doesn't want to stop.\"<br/><br/>\"By 'sanctuaries' I'm assuming that it is referring to your minds from the ethereal plane...\" Illuna says, as she ponders on my words for a few seconds. \"Alright, so did it give you a time limit? How long do you have until the ether destroys your souls?\"<br/><br/> \"Destroy our souls?...\" I say. \"Hey now, let's not get hasty! Nobody said anything about destroying any souls. We're just having a little disagreement, that's all.\"<br/>\"Right,\" Illuna says. \"Well, if you don't have a time limit, then I suggest you hurry it up before this 'disagreement' of yours turns into something a lot more final.\"<br/><br/>As Illuna was talking, I could hear a loud explosion above us, and when I turned my head to see what was happening, I realized that the king of the underground just did another one of his aura shockwaves that sent a few dozen drones crashing down all at once.<br/><br/>\"Please refrain from causing any more damage to the red-eyed units,\" the green-eyed drone tells the king on the ethereal plane. \"You are impeding them from completing their task.\"<br/><br/> \"And what task might that be?\" the king of the underground asks.<br/>\"The red-eyed units are attempting to carry your unconscious comrades out of the plaza, and to bring them into secure prison cells where they will remain for the foreseeable future,\" the green-eyed drone says.<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's what I thought,\" the king says.<br/><br/>\"If you do not cease your actions on the earthen plane immediately, the Overseer protocol will be forced to take more extreme measures to deal with the threat that you pose to this city's continued prosperity,\" the Overseer says.<br/><br/>\"Extreme measures, you say?...\" the king tells the Overseer. \"Well, why don't you show these 'extreme' measures to us, then?\"<br/><br/>\"As you wish,\" the Overseer says.<br/><br/>",

The red-eyed units will lead you to the designated safe areas in a timely manner. This is not a drill. I repeat. This is not a drill.\"<br/><br/>\"That's your big plan?\" I tell the green-eyed drone in the ethereal plane. \"Evacuating the city so you can use bigger spells on us without fear of collateral damage? You do realize that the king is still killing your drones faster than you can send them, don't you?\"<br/><br/>The Overseer does not say anything, but instead he sends his hydra to attack us again. As we are busy trying to stay alive on the ethereal plane, I begin to feel some earth tremors on the earthen plane, which are only intensifying with every passing moment. When I look around to figure out where this is coming from, I am shocked to see that five of the giant metal golems who were guarding the city gates are now approaching us slowly from a distance, while trampling and destroying every house on their way here.<br/><br/> \"Please remain calm,\" I hear the red-eyed drones talking through the voice magnifiers again, while people on the streets are running away, terrified. \"The red-eyed units will ensure your safety as long as you follow them. If you are worried about your destroyed houses, then rest assured that they will be rebuilt, and that you will very soon be reimbursed for all of the monetary losses that you've sustained during this conflict. Have a nice day!\"<br/>\"No way...\" I say, as I look at all the destruction that the metal giants are leaving in their wake.<br/><br/>\"Is this your idea of ruling a city?\" I ask the Overseer in the ethereal plane. \"You're going to destroy an entire neighborhood just to kill two or three people that are opposing you?\"<br/><br/>\"According to my analysis, the perceived threat of the king of the underground is higher than that of losing several structures,\" the Overseer says. \"Once this final war is over, the citizens and the drones will all work together to repair the damage that has been done.\"<br/><br/> \"Damn it...\" I say. \"Hey, king of the underground, are you listening? We need to take the fight away from the plaza or your rebels are going to be squashed to death soon!\"<br/>\"I can't leave them alone!\" the king tells me. \"If I fly away now, the red-eyed drones will surely seize the opportunity and capture them all while they're undefended.\"<br/><br/>\"Crap,\" I say. \"You're right.\"<br/><br/>I then pause for a few seconds, to think of my next course of action.<br/><br/>\"In that case, Flower, can you go back to your mind really quick and teleport Hadrik to his sanctuary?\" I say. \"I'm guessing that he must have remembered where his mind is located, by now. If we can at least have Hadrik awake on the earthen plane, we might have a chance against the golems.\"<br/><br/>\"Only Hadrik?...\" Flower says. \"What about the others?\"<br/><br/>",

I can't imagine how bad this would have been if I had told Melindra to cast the version of the currents where she needed to be awake to help me control them.<br/><br/>Before heading for the golem, I fly around for about twenty seconds or so, trying to see exactly how well I can handle myself in this storm.

In fact, I think it might even be a little easier, because the air currents are much more responsive than the controls of a gnomish flying contraption.<br/><br/>Once I'm done testing all of the basic flight maneuvers, I head straight for the metal golem that is closest to us, in the hopes that I can maybe lure it away from the plaza.

Am I really that predictable?

Thankfully, my air currents are extremely responsive, so I was able to pull off my stunt perfectly. Having successfully evaded the attack, I stop in mid-air again, so that I can taunt the golem some more.<br/><br/>\"You almost got it, buddy!\" I tell the metal giant. \"Why don't you try again? I'm sure you'll get it next time.\"<br/><br/>Once again the golem shoots me with its fire beam but I evade it easily, just as it was about to hit me. Seeing that my enemy has now stopped trying to aim for me and it's just standing there, confused, I cross my arms and then the two of us begin to simply look at each other, in complete silence.

After dodging two more beams by relying solely on my reflexes, I decide to stop in mid-air and to taunt the golem, since there really isn't much point in trying to outsmart it anymore.<br/>\"Come on!\" I shout at the golem, while waving my arms around like a lunatic. \"I'm right here! What are you waiting for?! Give it your best shot!\"<br/><br/>After a few seconds of silence, the golem fires its beam at me, and I move out of the way at the last possible moment. I then stop somewhere above the golem again, so that I can taunt it some more.<br/><br/>\"What's wrong?!\" I shout. \"Is your fancy algorithm too stupid to hit a stationary target? Can't predict my moves anymore if I'm standing in place? Huh?!\"<br/><br/>Once again the golem shoots me with its fire beam but I evade it easily, just as it was about to hit me. Seeing that my enemy has stopped trying to aim for me and it's just standing there, confused, I shrug at it from a distance with my arms stretched, and then we continue to watch each other for a while without saying anything.<br/><br/>While I am still waiting for my opponent to make a move, I see a small but familiar shape on the ground approaching the golem at a breathtaking speed.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch9_currents || 0) == 1 && (locals.v_aura_hardening || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_perception || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_reflexes || 0) < 3) {%> <br/><br/>I begin to focus my consciousness on the earthen plane and I raise my arms up, causing Melindra's air currents to activate themselves and to propel me upwards.<br/><br/>When I reach a higher altitude, I quickly realize that the air currents are very unresponsive compared to what they are usually like, and this is almost certainly because of the new version of currents that I asked Melindra to cast on me before the battle.

        "text": " Before the metal giant gets to understand what's happening, the small shape, also known as Hadrik, makes a high jump and it punches the golem in the head, sending it flying about fifty feet backwards and then causing it to land on its back on a few empty houses that got completely wrecked in the process. The dwarf does not give the golem the time to get back up and he jumps on its head, punching it several more times until the enemy stops moving completely.<br/>\"Hey, I'm back!\" Hadrik shouts at me, while still standing on the golem's head. \"Did you miss me?\"<br/><br/>\"You have no idea...\" I answer him.<br/><br/>\"So, what's the plan, here?\" Hadrik says. \"Should I also take care of the other four golems really quick? Is there anything else I should know about before I go?\"<br/><br/>\"Forget about the golems,\" the king of the underground says loudly, as he is now flying closer to us. \"I have a much better task for you. Let's all get a little closer to each other first. I don't want a certain someone to listen in on our conversation.\"<br/><br/>The king and I then both fly towards the ground, as Hadrik gets off the metal golem and walks in our direction to meet us halfway.<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" Hadrik says, once we're all close to each other. \"You said you had a task for me. Let's hear it.\"<br/><br/> \"Do you remember what the original purpose of our mission to the surface was?\" the king says, as he takes out a small metal device out of his pocket. \"The reason why we risked so many people's lives despite knowing what an overwhelming force the Overseer had at his disposal?\"<br/>\"Yeah, um...\" Hadrik says. \"We came here to destroy the, uhm... core, was it?... Yeah, the Overseer's core.\"<br/><br/>\"Precisely,\" the king says, and then he hands Hadrik the metal device. \"And this little device is what's going to lead you to our main objective. Here, let me show you how to use it.\"<br/><br/>He then presses a button on the device, and a small three-dimensional holographic map of our surrounding area begins to float above it, similar to the map that Arraka made for us when we were walking through the ogre fort in search of the sacred chalice. This map does not seem to be as detailed as the one made by Arraka, and there are no colored dots to indicate the enemies and allies in our vicinity, but there are however two dots, which I'm assuming are the only ones that are needed for our current purposes.<br/><br/>\"I see that neither of you are surprised,\" the king says, after looking at each of us in turn. \"Should I take it that you've seen a holographic map before?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Arraka cast one for us in the past.\"<br/><br/> \"The banshee in the amulet, right...\" the king says. \"Well, this particular map is nothing too fancy. It's just a simple illusion spell that indicates the device's current position and the position of the core, displaying them as dots on a three-dimensional map. The device was made by doctor Reidzek, so the chances of it malfunctioning should be very low. Anyway, the point is that with the Overseer focusing his attention and most of his forces on this plaza, and with the additional distraction that is created by our ongoing battle against him in the ethereal plane, there is no better moment than this to go destroy his core. Hadrik, with your speed and strength, you should be able to get to this location on the map, eliminate all remaining defenses and destroy the core in a matter of minutes. This whole fight could be over in mere minutes, do you understand what I'm saying?\"<br/>\"Okay, I get it, but what about the flying metal balls and the giant golems?\" Hadrik says. \"Couldn't they kill you in minutes too?\"<br/><br/>\"You leave those to us,\" the king says, as he pats me on the back. \"Barry and I have got it all covered. Isn't that right, Barry?\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, sure...\" I say. \"Sure, why not?\"<br/><br/>\"See?\" the king tells Hadrik. \"No problem here. Now go! Go, before the Overseer figures out what we're doing!\"<br/><br/>",

I can't afford to ignore them just because the hydra is attacking my soul on a different plane of existence. If I really want to make it out of this alive, then I'm going to need to find a way to control both my soul and my earthen body at the same time.<br/><br/> I close my eyes while the hydra is chasing me and I try to visualize the environments from Ollendor and the ether. On the one hand I've got an endless sea of light, and on the other, I have the wind blowing in my face and a whole bunch of wrecked buildings that I am flying over.<br/>When I will open my eyes, I will see both of these environments at the same time. I will be able to control my bodies from both planes at the same time. I can do this. I can do this.<br/><br/>\"What is wrong with you?!\" I hear Peter shouting at me in the ethereal plane. \"Open your eyes, you fool! The hydra is gaining on you!\"<br/><br/>As soon as I do what Peter said, I see the hydra in front of me, ready to take a bite off me, but I'm also seeing the storm and the crashed buildings in my peripheral vision. Even though I'm not focusing on it right now, I feel like I could seamlessly switch my consciousness to my earthen body and then back to my soul again by just blinking my eyes.<br/><br/>I use a gust of wind to push myself away from the hydra before it lunges for me, and then I blink. <br/><br/>Now I'm back in Ollendor, getting dangerously close to the four metal golems. One of them attacks me with a fire beam, and I roll in mid-air to the right side, getting out of the way in time and then continuing my flight towards them at a high speed. <br/><br/> Meanwhile, with the corner of my eye I see Peter spraying the hydra with acid in the ethereal plane. The monster brushes off the attack, just like it did with all of the other elements that we've thrown at it, and once it regenerates itself, it begins to go after Peter. I take advantage of this brief pause in the ethereal plane to position myself between two golems, hoping that I can trick them into destroying themselves by shooting their beams at each other. Sadly, the golems are not as stupid as I would have wished, and instead of shooting me, they're slowly walking towards me so that they can squash me between their palms.<br/>I blink again and switch my main focus to the ethereal plane, so that I can fly closer to the hydra and give Peter a helping hand. I begin to do the necessary hand motions for a paralysis spell, and once I am within range, I immediately cast it on the creature.<br/><br/>To our shock, the monster freezes in place right after I hit it with my spell, and it just stays like that for ten seconds, before it finally breaks free. Ten whole seconds of immobilization from a spell that is designed to paralyze human-sized beings?... That is incredible! A mammoth would have barely gotten stopped for more than a second by a spell like this.<br/><br/>Could it be possible that we've finally found the hydra's only weakness?<br/><br/>",

So far, Daren's barrier seems to be holding up nicely, but there's no telling when it will start to crack.<br/><br/>\"So, are we just stalling them, or?...\" Daren asks me, as all four beams are now hitting the barrier.<br/><br/>\"We just need to keep them busy for another minute or two,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Why?\" Daren says. \"What happens in two minutes?\"<br/><br/>\"The end of the battle, hopefully,\" I say, as I blink and then switch back to the ethereal plane to create two more of the magical pillars that were needed to cast the paralysis spell.<br/><br/>As soon as I am done placing the last pillar, I give the 'okay' signal to Peter so that we can commence our simultaneous casting.<br/><br/> The semi-invisible pillars that have been placed in a circle around the hydra are now all lighting up, and they are beginning to form a perimeter of green light around the monster. The light is getting more and more intense by the second, while the area inside the perimeter is getting bombarded by magical energy.<br/>As the king of the underground releases the hydra from its imprisonment, the green lights from the pillars are now all attacking the monster in unison. Realizing that its time is at an end, the hydra roars loudly with the majority of its heads. The only heads that remain silent, just like the last time, are the brown-colored ones. Coincidentally, these are also the only heads that haven't used any sort of breath attacks so far.<br/><br/>No breath attacks... No roaring... What are they waiting for, exactly?<br/><br/> When I see the two hydra heads looking directly at me, I get a sudden chill down my spine and without thinking, I rush towards the king and Peter, while doing some very quick gestures with my hands and chanting a really old incantation that I can't believe I'm still remembering after all the time that passed since I read about it.<br/>Just as I am finishing my spell, the brown hydra heads open their mouths at last, and the sound that they are making is so loud that it feels like it could rupture our eardrums in a matter of seconds. Fortunately for us, the spell that I was casting earlier finally activates itself, creating a large anti-sound barrier around Peter, the king and myself, which blocks all incoming noises, no matter how powerful they are.<br/><br/>As we are standing within our sound-proof shelter, we watch the hydra roaring silently for about another ten seconds or so, until the pillars unleash their last wave of energy upon the monster, turning it into stone.<br/><br/>\"Okay...?\" I say, as I look a little confused towards the hydra that had turned into a statue and then I deactivate the anti-sound barrier that was surrounding us. \"I could have sworn that this spell was meant to just paralyze, not petrify its target. I honestly have no idea where the petrification came from. But hey, I suppose beggars can't be choosers, right?\"<br/><br/>\"...How did you know?\" Peter asks, after looking at me in silence for a few seconds.<br/><br/>",

The light is getting more and more intense by the second, while the area inside the perimeter is getting bombarded by magical energy.<br/><br/>As the king of the underground releases the hydra from its imprisonment, the green lights from the pillars are now all attacking the monster in unison. Realizing that its time is at an end, the hydra roars loudly with the majority of its heads. The only heads that remain silent, just like the last time, are the brown-colored ones.

Fortunately for us, the spell that I was casting earlier finally activates itself, creating a large anti-sound barrier around Peter, the king and myself, which blocks all incoming noises, no matter how powerful they are.<br/><br/>As we are standing within our sound-proof shelter, we watch the hydra roaring silently for about another ten seconds or so, until the pillars unleash their last wave of energy upon the monster, turning it into stone.<br/><br/>\"Okay...?\" I say, as I look a little confused towards the hydra that had turned into a statue and then I deactivate the anti-sound barrier that was surrounding us. \"I could have sworn that this spell was meant to just paralyze, not petrify its target.

There is exactly one spot that should temporarily shield me from all of the golems at the same time, and that is at the very center of them. As long as I place myself correctly, I should be positioned right between two separate pairs of golems, and at a sufficient enough distance from them that they can't just instantly walk over to me and attack me with their hands.<br/><br/>This is perfect.

Or rather, the kind of fire that feels hot but for some reason is not burning me, even though she is touching me directly with it.<br/>\"Barry, do you remember what it was like inside your mind on the ethereal plane, before the Overseer kicked your soul out of it?\" Flower says, loudly. \"Can you picture the inside of your sanctuary in front of your eyes right now?\"<br/><br/>\"The inside of my sanctuary...\" I tell her, in a very weak voice. \"Yes...

That's all you remember?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, it... wasn't like your house, with paintings and... all the other stuff...\" I say. \"My sanctuary was just... an empty cube...\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, then I need you to think about the interior of the cube,\" Flower says. \"I need you to visualize it clearly inside your head. Do you understand?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes...\" I say, with my voice barely louder than a whisper.<br/>Just like she asked, I try to remember every small detail that I can from the place called my 'sanctuary', and then I recreate it inside my head. I then close my eyes, so that I can see the image in my mind more clearly.<br/><br/>\"I'm imagining it now...\" I tell Flower, in the same weak voice as before.<br/><br/>\"Do you have a clear image of it?\" Flower says, in a somewhat panicky voice. \"Are you certain?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, yes,\" I tell her with my eyes still closed. \"I'm looking at it as I'm speaking to you. What do I do now?\"<br/><br/>I can no longer see my body from the ethereal plane because my eyes are closed, but I can tell that it's only gotten more transparent since I've started talking to Flower.

Is she trying to send me back to my sanctuary? Is that why she asked me to imagine it inside my head?<br/><br/>As I continue to visualize the empty cube in my mind's eye, the bright light from both the teleportation spell and the ether disappears, and the only thing I can see through my eyelids is complete darkness. Does this mean that the teleportation was successful? I can't tell whether my body is back to normal or not. Aside from the light disappearing, I still feel weak, and it doesn't seem like much has changed.<br/><br/>The silence around me is deafening. The anticipation is killing me. Did I get teleported properly or not? I have to know!<br/><br/>",

I still have the image of the cube in front of me right now, so I guess I should probably keep thinking of it. This is the only thing I should be worrying about. Nothing else matters. Just keep imagining the cube.<br/><br/>A whole minute passes without me doing anything other than concentrating on the image of the sanctuary which I have in my head. Or at least I think it's been a minute. It's kind of hard to keep track of time in this complete darkness.<br/><br/>It's fine. There's no need to open my eyes. I'm still conscious for now, and this is all that matters. A minute ago, I could have sworn that I only had a few seconds left to live, but somehow I'm still here. I'm still awake. Whatever Flower did, it must have had at least some positive effect, or else I wouldn't be alive.<br/><br/> As I'm still waiting for something to happen, I suddenly feel myself being drenched from head to toe in freezing cold water, and when I instinctively jump up, I quickly realize that there is now ground beneath my feet, and it no longer feels like I'm floating in an endless darkness like before. The rain is pouring down my cheeks, a sound of lightning echoes in the distance, and the wind is still blowing.<br/>Is this it?... Am I finally back on the earthen plane for good?<br/><br/>\"Are you planning to open your eyes anytime soon, or are you expecting me to talk to you like this?...\" I hear Flower's voice, speaking in Illuna's tone.<br/><br/>When I finally open my eyelids, I see Flower standing right in front of me with blue flames in her eyes, confirming to me that Illuna was indeed still the one currently controlling her body on the earthen plane.<br/><br/>Every connection that I had with the ethereal plane is now gone. Even though I'm trying to switch my consciousness to the other realm, it's not working anymore. Could this be the result of my soul finally returning to my sanctuary on the ethereal plane?<br/><br/> \"There was this... darkness,\" I tell Illuna. \"It felt similar to the void that the Magium made me float around in when it almost erased me from the world, except this time I still had my memories and my identity left intact. Wait, no, that's not right... There was also something else different about this... nothingness that I was in. I didn't really get to see it because I had my eyes closed the whole time, but the darkness around me seemed almost... oppressive. Like it was trying to swallow me whole. Do you have any idea what might have happened?\"<br/>\"Ah, so that's what Flower did,\" Illuna says. \"I had some pretty strong suspicions, but I could barely get any kind of coherent information out of her through our telepathic link when I talked to her earlier. I should probably let her know that she didn't end up killing you by accident before she gives herself a heart attack out of pure anxiety.\"<br/><br/>\"She thought she might have killed me?...\" I ask, in an uneasy tone. \"Wait, what did she do?\"<br/><br/>Instead of answering me, Illuna raises two fingers in the air in front of me, signaling me to be quiet while she talks to Flower telepathically in the ethereal plane. Once she is done, she lowers her hand so that we can resume our conversation.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " We spend the next few minutes listening to Hadrik's story about how he broke through the Overseer's defenses and destroyed his core. In the meantime, the rest of our friends are awaking one by one and joining us, until Flower finally manages to guide all of our group's souls to their sanctuaries.<br/>Once we are all assembled and Hadrik is done telling his story, Illuna joins us as well, and we are now preparing to be teleported back to the underground. <br/><br/>While Peter is talking to Breynan on the transceiver, giving him an update on our current situation, I get a sudden dizziness, and for a split second it feels like my consciousness is drifting away again into the ethereal plane, where I get a direct view of the inside of my empty cube that is supposed to be my sanctuary. What just happened? Did I really switch back to my perspective from the ethereal plane for a second there, or am I just imagining things?<br/><br/>\"You alright, Barry?\" Hadrik says, when he sees me frozen in place at the back of the group, and sweating something fierce.<br/><br/>\"You didn't... feel anything just now?\" I ask Hadrik, as I'm trying to calm myself down.<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Hadrik asks. \"What was I supposed to feel?\"<br/><br/>\"...Nothing,\" I tell him. \"I'm sure it was nothing. We should... probably get a little closer to the rest of the group. It will make it easier for Breynan to teleport us.\"<br/><br/> As Hadrik nods and then walks a little closer to the others, I stand there in place for a few more seconds, contemplating on what just happened.<br/>A fluke. It has to have been a fluke. Hadrik didn't experience anything unusual, so we're not being targeted by the Overseer again. Even if what I saw was real, I was clearly sitting inside my sanctuary, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I'm not going to get kicked out into the ether again.<br/><br/>After the brief pause, I decide that there's no point in dwelling on this any further, and I follow Hadrik as well, in order to get ready for our teleportation. <br/><br/>\"Everything is fine,\" I tell myself, as our bodies begin to vibrate loudly and the usual bright teleportation light envelops us all.<br/><br/>There is nothing to worry about. My consciousness only got sent back to the ethereal plane once, and only for one second. It was probably just a small side-effect due to my soul's prolonged exposure to the ether. I will likely forget all about this in no time, and the event won't ever repeat itself.<br/><br/>Everything is fine.<br/><br/>",
