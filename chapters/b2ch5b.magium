 "I remember you saying something similar before our battle with the troll..." Leila writes.
"Yeah, but now it's different," I say. "The troll is dead. So are the creatures. I don't see what other tricks they could pull out of their sleeve this late in the game."

"Really?" Leila writes. "You don't see any way in which the organizers could guarantee your death in the next round?"

"Not a one," I tell her. 

"Alright, then," Leila writes, simply.

A few minutes later, the announcer receives a written list from a member of the organizing team, and after glancing over it for a few seconds, he begins to read it aloud.

"I am now going to announce the names of the gladiators that will be fighting in the first duel," the announcer says. "This will be a fight to the death. The gladiators will need to battle until only one of them is left alive. No surrendering is allowed."

"Get ready," Leila writes to me.

"Ready for what?" I ask her.

"The name of the gladiators are--" the announcer says, as he gets ready to read the first line on the parchment.

 "--Barry and Daren," the announcer continues.
"Oh," I tell Leila.

The iron gate in front of me gets raised, and so does the one from Daren's division.

"Will the two gladiators who just had their names called please enter the fighting area?" the announcer says, in a bored voice. "Thank you."

"Oh..." I tell Leila again, not knowing what else to say at this point.

"Good luck..." Leila writes, with a serious look on her face, as I slowly step out of my division area and into the arena.

Okay, calm down, there's no need to panic. I've gotten through every obstacle in my path so far. There's no reason why this should be any different. So there's no need to panic, okay? No reason. Just need to calm down. No panic. No panic...

While I'm busy thinking to myself, Daren is also slowly advancing towards me, only he seems to be unusually calm about all of this. Why is that? Is it because he knows he can beat me? No, no, that can't be the reason. Could it be that he already managed to figure a way out of this mess? What is he planning to do, exactly? Damn it, I'm sure that I could come up with a plan too, if only I could manage to calm down!

Once Daren and I both get to the center of the arena, facing each other, Daren gives me a wide grin, he drops his sword and shield on the ground, and then he throws his hands in the air.

 "I surrender!" Daren shouts, as loud as he can. "I cannot fight this man. How could I?"
"This fight is to the death, healer," the announcer says. "Even if this man is your friend--"

"I mean, look at those muscles!" Daren shouts loudly, interrupting the announcer. "No sane man would ever dare fight such a beast!"

Suddenly all of the spectators in the crowd burst into laughter.

"Those arms look like he could smash my head like a watermelon between his bare hands!" Daren continues, with a mocking grin on his face. "And look at the size of his back! May the gods have mercy on my soul!"

Laugh it up, Daren... 

Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. The idea to surrender was genius. Genius, and yet so obvious. How did I not think of this?

While the crowds are still laughing, the ambassador of Ollendor is making his way into the fighting area through one of the iron gates, and he is heading towards us.

"What is the meaning of this?" the ambassador shouts, and the crowds slowly fall silent. "Why aren't you fighting? This is a fight to the death! You can't just surrender!"

 "Well, what are you going to do about it?" Daren tells him, with a smirk, when he reaches us.
The ambassador's face turns red with rage, and then he looks towards me.

"You there!" he says. "Peasant! Your opponent is disarmed. Finish him off now, or face the consequences!"

 "Who are you calling a peasant? Peasant!"
As I speak, I use a loud enough tone of voice to make sure that the spectators can hear me.

"I'm not the peasant, you lowborn scum!" the ambassador shouts. "You're the peasant!"

"No, you're the peasant!" I tell him.

"You are the peasant!!!" the ambassador shouts, with his face even redder than before.

The spectators cannot contain themselves any longer, and they all start laughing in unison.

"Hey, Daren," I say. "I think I finally found someone who is even easier to tease than Flower!"

"Are you mocking me?" the ambassador says.

"Of course he's mocking you," Daren says. "I mean, seriously, what did you expect? Did you really think that you could just come in here and convince us to kill each other if you yelled at us a little?"

 "If you don't kill each other, I'll have you both executed!" the ambassador shouts.
"No, you won't," Daren says, loudly, so that everyone can hear him. "There is no standard arena rule that says we need to kill each other. We only broke one of this event's rules. That means that you can't execute us. You can only make us into undesirables, and force us to participate in the penalty round. Those are the rules."

"I don't care about the rules!" the ambassador shouts. "I make the rules! You will do as I say, or you are both going to die!"

There is a loud murmur coming from the spectator seats after the ambassador's last outburst. The ambassador does not notice, and he continues his rant.

"Which instant?" I ask him.

"This instant!" the ambassador shouts.

"You mean this instant right now, or the one from when you were just talking?" I ask him. "Because if you need him killed in the past, I may have to learn some time magic, first!"   

The spectators cannot contain themselves any longer, and they all start laughing in unison.

"Of course he's mocking you," Daren says. "I mean, seriously, what did you expect? Did you really think that you could just come in here and convince us to kill each other if you yelled at us a little?"

 "Fine, fine, I'll finish him off," I say.
I start walking towards Daren, with my dagger still in its sheath, and I stop within arm's reach of him. I then punch him lightly in the chest, and Daren throws himself to the ground, pretending to die in a very fake and dramatic way.

"It is done," I tell the ambassador, in a very loud voice, in order to make sure that everyone in the crowd can hear me. "The healer is dead."

The spectators cannot contain themselves any longer, and they all start laughing in unison. The ambassador's face is now even redder than before.

"Are you mocking me?" he shouts.

"Of course we're mocking you," Daren says from the ground, as he slowly gets back up. "What did you expect? You didn't really think that we'd change our minds and start killing each other just because you told us to, did you?"  

 "If you don't kill each other, I'll have you both executed!" the ambassador shouts.
"No, you won't," Daren says, loudly, so that everyone can hear him. "There is no standard arena rule that says we need to kill each other. We only broke one of this event's rules.

 "Did you seriously think that those rules ever had any importance?" the ambassador shouts, even louder than before. "This whole arena's only purpose was to have you killed! You were never meant to walk out of here alive! Do you hear me? This whole arena was nothing but a farce! Don't make the mistake of thinking that you have any chance of survival just because you've won two measly rounds. I am the ambassador of Ollendor! If I wanted, I could have you both executed right now, in front of all these people, and nobody would bat an eye! That is how much power I have! Now hurry up and kill each other like the dogs you are, or I will have your heads placed on spikes, along with all of your friends!"
While the ambassador was talking, the murmurs from the crowd started to slowly turn into booing that only intensified the more the ambassador spoke. By the time he finished his monologue, most of the spectators had picked up the booing, and they were getting louder by the second.

"Off with the ambassador's head!" shouts one of the spectators, loudly enough for everyone to hear him.

This one phrase seemed to have perfectly resonated with what everyone was thinking at that moment, because all the spectators in the crowd gradually picked it up and made a shorter version of it, in order to be able to chant it in unison, repeatedly.

"Off with his head! Off with his head! Off with his head!" the crowds keep chanting, as the ambassador's arrogant look on his face slowly gets replaced with a much darker and more fearful expression, while a trickle of sweat begins to run down his forehead.

 "How does it feel, ambassador?" we suddenly hear Eiden's voice, coming from somewhere behind the ambassador, although the stillwater himself is nowhere to be seen.
"Damn it, not again!" Daren says, as soon as he hears Eiden's voice.

"Is that... Eiden?" the ambassador says, as he looks around, trying to identify the source of the sound.

"How does it feel to have so many people threatening to end your life at the same time?" Eiden says. "Take a good look at these people, ambassador. Do you think that they would care about your high rank if you met them now on the street? Do you think that they would hesitate to kill you, even for a moment, if they were given the chance to do so?"

He pauses.

"These are the people that you've shunned all of your life, ambassador," Eiden continues. "And you have done so due to your strict adherence to the belief that all of the people below your social rank were nothing but inferior creatures, unworthy of your attention. Do you still have what it takes to stick to your beliefs now, and face the direct consequences of your actions? What choice will you make, ambassador? Your time is running out."

TEXT: 

 I can almost imagine Eiden's smirk, with his closed eyes, as he watches the ambassador biting his nails, trying to find a solution that could help him both to calm down the crowds, and to have us killed on the spot. The solution, however, never came.
"I've changed my mind!" the ambassador says, finally, loudly enough so that the spectators can hear him. "We will follow the rules! These two gladiators have now become undesirables. If they survive the final round, then they will be set free, as promised. You may continue the rest of the round as you see fit."

He then storms out of the fighting area, and as far away from the booing noises as his legs can carry him. In the meantime, Daren has picked up his sword and shield from the ground, and he is now looking towards the place where we've heard Eiden's voice coming from.

"So, how's it going, Eiden?" Daren says. "Are you enjoying the show?"

The empty place that Daren is addressing gives him no answer.

"You know, I was thinking..." Daren says, ignoring the fact that Eiden never answered his question. "While I was travelling, I've often heard of these new types of circuses, where they involve their audience directly in some parts of their shows. I was thinking that since you're such a loyal spectator, maybe we could try some of that! What do you think?"

 Daren pauses for a bit, as if he were actually waiting for Eiden to say something.
"Great!" Daren says. "Here goes!"

He then throws his sword with breathtaking speed, right at the spot where Eiden was standing invisibly a few minutes prior. The sword passes through the empty space where the stillwater had been standing, and it falls on the ground, a few dozen feet beyond that position. Looking a bit disappointed, Daren lets out a small sigh, and he goes to retrieve his sword. 
  
Not long after the departure of the ambassador, the announcer officially ends the fight between me and Daren, and he declares me as the victor of the battle, due to Daren's surrender. As I am preparing to return to my division room, the announcer stops me, telling me that I was scheduled to fight to the death with a gladiator from the sixth division right after my battle with Daren. The announcer also reminds me that as an undesirable, I now have the right to refuse to fight until the penalty round, if I so desire.

 I decide to accept the duel. I'd much rather fight this gladiator now, while he's alone, than be forced to face him later on in the penalty round, when we'll be fighting everyone at once.
I notify the announcer that I've decided to stay, and an iron gate opens up, clearing the way for my adversary to enter the battlefield. As the man enters the fighting area, I recognize him as being one of the more proficient fighters in his group. Actually, I'd even go as far as saying that he is comparable in terms of combat prowess to the fighters from the first division. His build is also quite impressive, being as tall as Daren and as bulky as Bruce. Just like most of the other gladiators, he seems to be wearing leather armor, but instead of a sword, his weapon of choice appears to be a large double-edged battle-axe, which he is now holding in both hands.

The beginning of the fight will likely be announced as soon as he reaches me. Now, then... How do I go about this? The fight is to the death, but as an undesirable, I am no longer bound by such rules. If I want him out of the way, killing him would be easier, but technically I could also just break one of his legs or something, and it should be enough for my intents and purposes.

 I have no reason to spare this man's life. Judging by his muscular build, I very much doubt that this is his first fight in an arena. He likely will not hesitate to kill me if given the chance, and neither should I.
But how will I fight him? Do I try to disarm him first, or should I just focus on hitting him where he's undefended? Would it be a better idea to wait for him to make mistakes or to attack him head on and take him by surprise? I'd much rather prefer to have a plan than to rely solely on instinct.

We both wait for the announcer to give us the signal, and once our battle officially begins, the gladiator charges at me directly, with his axe raised in the air, ready to strike.

I somehow manage to surprise him even when he was the one who initiated the attack, and I use my scimitar like a hook, to pull his battle-axe out of his hands by its head.

Once my opponent gets disarmed, I make a quick rush towards him with my weapon, and in an attempt to dodge me, he falls on his back. I then immediately put my blade to his throat, not giving him a chance to get back up.

It's going to be a bit hard to take him by surprise, when he's trying to do the exact same thing to me at the same time, but it's a bit late to change tactics now. I charge towards the gladiator as well, and I attempt to catch him off-guard with my speed, so that I can attack him before he gets a chance to block.

I somehow manage to surprise him even when he was the one who initiated the attack, and I use my scimitar to stab him between his ribs. Given the curved nature of my weapon, the cut does not go very deep, but it is enough for the gladiator to panic and to jump back, in order to get away from my blade. I quickly follow him, and I slash at him again, which makes him trip and fall on his back, while dropping the battle-axe from his hands. I then kick the weapon away from him, and I put my scimitar to his throat, to make sure that he won't try to get up anymore.

That one moment was all he needed, and he quickly brings down his battle-axe upon me, killing me in one blow.

Evading the warrior's attacks is definitely not easy, due to the large size of his battle-axe, and there are more than a few times when I almost feel like I'm not going to make it. Fortunately, the long reach of my scimitar gives me a little bit more space to maneuver, and it also allows me to parry some of the strikes that might have hit me otherwise. As soon as I catch my opponent on the wrong footing, I use my scimitar like a hook, to pull his battle-axe out of his hands by its head, sending it flying away and out of his reach.

Once my opponent gets disarmed, I make a quick rush towards him with my weapon, and in an attempt to dodge me, he falls on his back. I then immediately put my blade to his throat, not giving him a chance to get back up.

 I take my weapon away from the man's throat, and then I use it to stab him directly in the heart, granting him a quick death.

 I ignore the crowds, and I use my blade to stab the gladiator in his right leg. This should be enough to make sure that he won't be fighting me in the final round.
I then turn my back on him and start walking away. 

"What do you think you are doing?" the announcer says.

"I'm going back to my division room," I say. "The fight is over. I won."

"No, the fight is not over until I say it is over," the announcer says, angrily. "Now, get back there and finish the job!"

"Nah," I say.

"What is your problem?" the announcer says. "This man isn't your friend! I bet you've never even seen him before this arena event. Why are you not killing him?"

"I refuse to kill a guy I've just met for the sole purpose of your entertainment," I say. "My only goal was to incapacitate him in order to not have to fight him in the final round. If you want to kill him, do it yourselves."

"I'm not going to announce your win until you kill this man," the announcer says.

"Then make him the winner," I say. "I don't care. I'm done, here."

As I take my leave, the crowds begin booing me. Their shouts and insults are only getting louder as I approach my division room.

"Shut up!" I shout at them, as I finally snap. 

 The noise from the crowd slowly dies down, as the spectators are all looking at me, curiously, to see what I have to say.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" I continue. "Is this what you consider entertainment? Watching people murder each other and get mauled by wild beasts? How sick in the head do you have to be to get enjoyment out of something like this? You're all pathetic! Does it make you feel good to know that some people have even worse lives than you? Is this why you're watching this crap? Well, I've got news for you! As soon as you walk out of here, it's going to be the same crappy lives waiting for you, outside! And you all deserve it! The way you are all treating these gladiators is the same way that the nobles are treating you. You have no right to complain about anything that is going on in your lives. How about you all take a small break and do a bit of self-reflection before you start booing me again like a bunch of mindless sheep? I'm going back to my cell. I'm done with you idiots."

Unsurprisingly, as soon as I finish my speech, the booing from the crowd gets louder than ever before, and the swearing is now a lot more diverse, as well. I ignore the sheep, and I return to my division area without as much as a single glance towards any of them.

"Wow," Leila writes, when the iron gate closes behind me. "That was... quite the speech."

"Yeah," I say, simply, and then we both watch the next fights in silence.

However, there seemed to be something of a pattern forming with the scheduling of the duels. First of all, neither me, nor Daren, nor Hadrik were being called anymore for any of the fights. Kate was scheduled to fight a few times, but she refused every time, taking full advantage of her undesirable status. Secondly, there have been no more fights to the death whatsoever, after my last battle. Most of the battles ended with light scratches, or with gladiators surrendering before the fight even began, due to obvious differences in power levels.
By the time the third round ended, it was getting pretty obvious that these changes had been specifically requested by the ambassador, with the purpose of keeping as many of the gladiators alive as possible, in order to get us to fight them all in the penalty round.

The winner of the third round was some guy from the seventh division that didn't really do anything special, but had the luck of running into a lot of cowards who surrendered before their fights even began. Once the winner received his prize, the announcer called for all the gladiators to assemble in the fighting area one last time, so the penalty round could finally begin.

"Will the undesirables please form a line and face the rest of the gladiators?" the announcer says.

 Daren, Hadrik, Kate and I all head towards the center of the arena, and we stand side by side, preparing our weapons. 
"Now, who is ready to participate in the final--" the announcer starts to say, but he stops, when he sees Leila and Bruce both move at the same time, in order to join our side.

"What are you doing?" the announcer says. "You are on the wrong side! Neither of you are undesirables!"

"Yet!" Bruce says.

"You are saying," the announcer says, "that you are voluntarily turning yourselves into undesirables after the event has already ended, just to stand by these gladiators' side?"

"The true members of the fourth division shall stand united until the very last blow of the horn," Bruce says.

Wilhelm frowns at Bruce, who was looking straight at him when he said those last words. The assassin, however, chooses not to respond to Bruce's provocation, and he remains in his spot.

 "Very well," the announcer says. "While we're at it, is there anyone else who would like to join the undesirables' side?"
The gladiators fall silent, and it seems that nobody else is planning to join us anymore.

"Good!" the announcer says. "Then it's about time that we get this round started, don't you think? Volunteers, please step forward, so that you may join this optional round."

One of the gladiators begins to move forward, but another one pulls him back, from behind.

"Do you have a death wish?" the gladiator from behind says. "Don't you see who you're up against? That dwarf pulverized half of the manticores and the scorpions all by himself! And that healer in armor pretty much fought all the monsters by himself too, and he doesn't even have a scratch. You'd have to be insane to want to fight them!"

Hearing the gladiator's speech, the few other warriors who were planning to join the final round are now all starting to have second thoughts.

 "Really?" the announcer asks, shocked, as he sees that none of the gladiators are volunteering to fight. "No one? Do you people realize what you can gain if you kill either one of those warriors in front of you? You can be freed just like that, or get showered with riches!"
"Better to be poor than dead," one of the gladiators says, while many of the others nod in agreement.

"What do you all think you are doing?" the ambassador shouts furiously, as he comes running into the fighting area once more. "Why aren't you fighting them? There are dozens of you! Dozens!"

"Numbers don't mean anything when you're up against enemies of that caliber," one of the gladiators says.

The gladiators fall silent, and it seems that nobody else is planning to join us anymore.

 "What caliber?" the ambassador shouts, furiously. "They are just a bunch of peasants! Do you think that fighting them is not worth the risk? Then I'll make it worth it! I can give you money beyond your wildest dreams. You will never have to work another day in your life! If you join this fight, I will free you all and give you a high enough status that you will never risk having to fight in a place like this ever again! Just tell me what you want, and I will provide it for you! All you have to do is fight! Fight, damn you!"
The gladiators are all looking at each other, with an uneasy look in their eyes, but it doesn't seem like any of them are seriously considering accepting the ambassador's offer.

"What is wrong with you?" the ambassador shouts, with his face red from anger. "Do you have no ambitions? No goals? What is it going to take to make you fight them? What is it going to take? Tell me, you miserable excuses for human beings! What do you want? Tell me! Tell--"

The ambassador's last words get drowned out by a few very loud horns that seem to all be blowing in unison from different sides of the city. The crowds are starting to panic. It seems that they all know something we don't. Whatever it is that those horns were supposed to signify, I'm definitely not liking the sound of this.

 "Oh, no..." the announcer says, trying to keep calm. "Will the spectators please evacuate the arena in a calm and orderly fashion? The show is cancelled. I repeat. The show is cancelled!"
The spectators are now rushing in droves towards the exits of the coliseum, and while they are not looking very calm and orderly to me, they are at least not knocking each other down, so they still have some sense of self-control left in them, despite their panic.

Now that he's done with the spectators, the announcer turns towards us.

"Gladiators," he says. "I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to temporarily join the forces of our army until our current crisis gets averted. According to the laws of Thilias, during a city-wide state of emergency, gladiators are to be used as resources of the kingdom, until the state of emergency is officially declared to be over."

The announcer interrupts himself, because a very powerful wind comes blowing towards us all, feeling as if it could lift us in the air any second, if we weren't on our guards.

This wind... I've only witnessed something like this once before. Oh gods, please, don't let this be--

"Half-lessathi," I hear a familiar voice calling me from above. "I've been looking for you."

As I hesitantly turn my head upwards, I see Tyrath, the king of all dragons, flapping his wings high above in the sky, while looking directly at me with a menacing stare.

"Gods have mercy..." Bruce says.

 The announcer screams, and he falls on his back, as soon as he sees the dragon. The spectators look terrified. They are now screaming and pushing each other like madmen. At this rate, it won't take long until some of them get pushed to the ground and get trampled by the stampeding crowd.
The ambassador lets out a girly scream, and he runs away, as fast as his legs can carry him, outside of the fighting area.

"Did you think that you could hide from me forever, half-lessathi?" Tyrath says. "You should have realized that I would be able to track down your smell as soon as you'd get out from your underground hole. All you managed to do was prolong the inevitable."

 "Hey, Tyrath!" we hear Arraka's voice coming from our left. "Long time no see! Remember me? It's your old friend, Arraka!"
Flower is now jumping down from the spectator seats, using fire jets coming from her feet to slow down her fall. She then comes running to join the rest of us in the center of the arena.

"Arraka..." Tyrath says, taking his eyes off me to look towards her amulet.

"Is it just me or did you get a new look?" Arraka asks the dragon. "What happened to your scales made of molten lava? Where is that intimidating fiery aura that you used to have? Wait, is it because you got older? Aha- AHAHAHAHA! So much for being all-powerful, huh? I bet you must really hate yourself for having become such a weakling!"

"How did you break the seal?" Tyrath asks her.

"You mean the seal from the cave?" Arraka asks. "Seriously? You never even found out I escaped? How did you even manage to miss the still winter? Were you hibernating or something? Boy, do I have some stories to tell you!"

 "The seal," Tyrath says again. "How did you break it?"
"Oh, that old thing had already started to crack after the first thousand years or so," Arraka says. "As soon as there were enough cracks in it, all I had to do was wait for someone to enter the cave, and BAM! I took over his body. Or at least I tried to. We ended up having to share it, eventually. But seriously, though, what did you think would happen? You had to ally yourself with all of those lessathi and mages just to stand a chance against me, and you thought that your half-assed seal would hold me there forever? Don't make me laugh! The only reason why you even managed to beat me was because I'd only just gotten myself banned from the magical plane, and I didn't really know the ins and outs of this world at the time. If we had a rematch now, I'd obliterate you."

"You would obliterate me from inside your amulet?" Tyrath says.

"Hey, you break this amulet for me, and we can have that rematch right now, if you want," Arraka says.

"You can stay there and rot," Tyrath says. "I didn't come here for you. I came here to get revenge, and to prove to an insignificant insect just how hopeless it is to oppose me."

 "Wait, are you talking about me?"
"Yes, I'm talking about you, you miserable wretch!" Tyrath shouts. "Now stop talking, and activate your magic stats again so I can prove to you how weak you truly are!"

"Uh, you see..." I tell the dragon. "The thing is that I can't really activate those stats anymore."

"So, you refuse to fight me at your full power, then?" Tyrath says.

"No, you don't understand," I say. "I'm saying that I really can't use those stats right now. Couldn't you come back later, after I've learned how to activate them?" 

"If you're not planning to activate the stats," the dragon says, "then I'm going to start by slowly murdering all of your friends, one by one, until you finally come to your senses. And once I'm done with you, I will destroy this entire city, and then I will burn all the other human settlements from this continent to the ground. I will do today what I should have done ten thousand years ago. Your race was never meant to get out of the caves."

Immediately after he finishes his speech, a very large explosion envelops the dragon, and then a few smaller explosions start to fill the area around him. Flower, who is now high up in the sky, some two hundred feet away from the dragon, makes a victory gesture with her right fist, as soon as she sees the explosions.

 "Nice job distracting him, Barry!" Flower says, as she gives me a thumbs up, while still floating in the sky, with the aid of the fire jets coming from her feet. 
"Watch out!" I shout at her. "The dragon is immune to fire!"

"Even if he is immune to fire," Illuna says, "the impact from the explosions is still going to leave a mark."

"Well, you heard her!" Flower says, with a smirk. "One more fireball, coming up!"

The girl then creates a spinning ball of fire between her hands, and she sends it flying towards the dragon, making it explode on impact.

"So this is the dragon that you guys were talking about," Hadrik says, with half a grin, and with a look of both excitement and apprehension in his eyes. "Let's see what he's made of, then!"

Hadrik then turns into a giant eagle, and he soars into the sky, towards the dragon. Flower makes sure to stop her fireballs when she sees him, and as soon as Hadrik positions himself above Tyrath, he turns back into his usual dwarf form, making a dive towards the dragon and punching him in the back. Hadrik's punch was so strong that we heard it from all the way down here, and it sent the dragon flying a dozen feet towards the ground. The dwarf then turns back into an eagle, and he flies away, waiting to see what his opponent will do next.

 "Didn't you lose against me the last time, though?"

 The dragon looks furious. It seems that he's planning to go all out from the start, this time around. Before Flower gets to cast a new fireball, the dragon disappears from where he was previously, and he reappears right in front of her, slashing at her with one of his claws. Flower reacts immediately, and she uses a jet of fire from her left hand to push her to the side, and out of the dragon's reach. Tyrath wastes no time, and he teleports again, right behind Flower. This time, it is Illuna who quickly turns around, and she uses two water jets from her hands to attack the dragon and also to push herself away from him at the same time. While the girl and the dragon repeat the same motions a few more times, Kate is preparing a very large cone of ice in the air above her, getting ready to send it flying towards Tyrath.
"Kate, this isn't going to work," Daren tells her, as he sees her preparing her ice cone. "Don't you remember how things went the last time we've fought him? Your ice cones didn't affect him at all. If you could use one of your ice platforms to fly me all the way into the sky, maybe I could manage to hurt him with my sword."

"This won't be like the last time," Kate says, with a determined look on her face. "Now that I know the full extent of my enemy's power, I no longer have the luxury to worry about conserving my magical energy. This time, I'm going to fight him with all I've got, even if I end up fainting from exhaustion."

 "Damn it, listen to me!" Daren says, but Kate ignores him, and she surrounds herself in a cage made of ice that she then uses to lift her up in the sky, so she can get a better view of her target.
The cone of ice that she's creating is definitely looking a lot different from anything she's ever made before. It looks as sharp and durable as elven steel, and it is simply radiating magical energy. It feels like the whole area around it is trembling from the magical power that is being pumped into that one ice cone, and once the creation process is complete, the cone starts turning by itself, following the dragon's movements. After Tyrath teleports a few more times in order to attack Flower, Hadrik finally catches up to him again, in his eagle form, and he turns into a dwarf once more, punching him right in the face.

 While the dragon gets briefly stunned by the dwarf's attack, Kate uses the opportunity to launch her ice cone at her target. There is an extremely powerful explosion of air behind the ice cone, as it gets sent straight into the dragon's chest at an incredible speed. The icicle penetrates Tyrath's tough hide, and he lets out a very loud roar, which almost makes everyone lose their consciousness, even while they are desperately trying to cover their ears. The dragon then yanks the ice cone out of his chest with his claw, and he teleports right next to Kate, who is now barely even able to stand on her feet, inside her floating ice cage, due to the dragon's roar from before. Just as the dragon is about to burn her alive with his fire breath, a golden cage appears out of nowhere, trapping him inside. This does not stop Tyrath from breathing his fire, but somehow, none of the flames manage to pass through the cage's bars, and they eventually die out by themselves.
"The fox's cage..." Tyrath says.

He then turns around, looking straight at Illuna.

"Is this your doing?" he asks her.

"I've had enough of your annoying teleporting," Illuna says. "You are going to stay put for the next few minutes. Do you understand?"

"How is this going to help you in any way?" Tyrath says. "I may not be able to attack you from inside here, but neither can you. All you are doing is wasting time."

"Not exactly," Illuna says.

 Flower then starts to move around the dragon's cage with her fire jets, creating balls of fire with her hands, and then leaving them floating one by one, all around the cage. 
"I'd like to see you handle all of these at once, king of dragons," Flower says, with a smirk.

The dragon scoffs, and he begins to cast a series of protection spells on himself, getting prepared for the moment when the cage disappears. Kate is now also creating as many of her newly designed ice cones as she can, although judging by the expression on her face, this process is definitely wearing her out much faster than her usual means of casting magic. I don't know if she can keep this up much longer.

Damn it, there has to be something I can do in this situation. Maybe I can find a way to get up there somehow.

 As I look around, I see, to my surprise, that the empty spectator area is now slowly being filled with hundreds of persons dressed in guard uniforms, and many of them are holding some very peculiar weapons in their hands. In the meantime, some other people are pushing several flying machines into the arena's fighting area. The machines look similar to the flying contraptions built by gnomes, with a large propeller on top, a long tail in the back, and two wings that help with gliding through the air. The propeller is usually powered by a spell cast by an air elementalist, but aside from that, there is no further need for magic in order to help these machines fly.
I used to know a gnome a few years ago who would keep making me do flight tests of his prototypes in exchange for the information I needed about mages. I remember one of those prototypes being so bad that the propeller actually stopped working while I was in mid-flight, and I had to glide all the way down. I still have nightmares about some of those flights even to this day.

One of the people that pushed the flying contraptions into the arena is now having an argument with a gnome, not very far from our position. As I look closer, I realize that the gnome is none other than king Golmyck.

 "What do you mean the pilots and the gunners aren't here, yet?" Golmyck says. "I specifically asked for three pilots and gunners to be ready and waiting in case any of the manticores went berserk! Where are they now?"
"I apologize, your highness," says the man who helped push the machinery. "The manticores were all killed in the first round, so the pilots and gunners went out for a drink. I tried to contact them through their transceivers, but they wouldn't answer..."

"Damnations!" Golmyck says. "I'd pilot one of these myself, but I still need someone to man the guns!"

He then turns towards us.

"You there, gladiators!" he says. "You're all in the army now, am I correct? Do any of you have any experience piloting aircraft? Or are you at least any good at aiming from a moving vehicle? I could use some help, here!"

 "I've piloted gnomish flying machines before," I say. "I could give it a try."
"Splendid!" Golmyck says. "Come over here, uh... Barry, was it? I'll teach you the basics."

"I'll go help the soldiers," Daren says. "They'll need all the protection they can get if they're planning to start shooting at the dragon."

He then rushes towards one of the gates, in order to reach the upper levels, where the soldiers are currently located.

"Now, Barry, listen closely," Golmyck says, once I reach him. "These are your flight controls."

He then points towards the cockpit.

"Over here you have the control stick," Golmyck continues. "The rudder pedals are down below. You should only change the rudder's direction for making minor adjustments, and not for actually turning the aircraft. Turning should only be done by using the control stick."

"Yes, I know," I tell him.

"This lever over here," Golmyck says, as he points towards a lever on the left side of the cockpit, "is used to adjust the pitch for the rotor blades. Increasing the pitch will make you gain altitude, but it will decrease your forward speed. Decreasing the pitch will make you lose altitude. Does this all look familiar to you?"

"Yeah," I say. "It's pretty similar to what I've piloted in the past. I can handle it."

 "Perfect!" Golmyck says. "When I designed these machines, I tried to make the controls as intuitive as possible for people who have piloted other gnomish machines in the past. I'm glad to see that my efforts were not wasted!"
The gnome looks up at the dragon trapped in the golden cage, with a thoughtful expression on his face.

"Barry," Golmyck says, "you wouldn't happen to know how much longer that cage is going to last, would you?"

"Uh..." I say. "About two more minutes, I guess?..."

"Good," Golmyck says. "We have plenty of time. Hop in. I'll give you the rest of the instructions during our flight. Make sure to strap yourself in tight. Also, you should wear these goggles."

Golmyck gives me a pair of protective goggles, which I immediately put on, and then I enter the cockpit, strapping myself in. There are only two chairs in the cockpit, one for the gunner and one for the pilot, back to back. The gnome enters the cockpit as well, seating himself on the chair behind me and then putting on his straps.

"Now, Barry, listen closely," Golmyck says, once I reach him. "This right here is the main gun you'll be using."

He points towards a small turret that is located at the base of the machine's tail.

"You can turn this left and right by using these handles," Golmyck continues. "You can also pull on the same handles to turn the turret up and down. The trigger is over here. The mechanism is somewhat similar to the regular cannons that are being used on ships, except this turret magically loads itself with bullets and black powder, so you only need to worry about aiming and shooting. Do try to use these bullets sparingly, though. Our ammunition is not unlimited."

"Uh..." I say. "I may be stating the obvious, here, but you do realize that normal bullets will not work on this dragon, right?"

 "Of course, of course," Golmyck says. "That's why we won't be using regular bullets. The bullets that I've loaded into this turret are made of a metal that is highly resistant to acid, and they have all been coated with acid, which we know for a fact that the dragon is weak against. We've had these prepared for a while, since Tyrath has been a looming threat for quite some time, now. Obviously, even with the acid coating, the bullets will likely only moderately inconvenience him, but that's fine, since they are only meant as a distraction."
The gnome looks up at the dragon trapped in the golden cage, with a thoughtful expression on his face.

"Barry," Golmyck says, "you wouldn't happen to know how much longer that cage is going to last, would you?"

 "So, uh..." I say, as I see the gnome adjusting the turret that is located at the base of the machine's tail. "I may be stating the obvious, here, but you do realize that normal bullets will not work on this dragon, right?"

The gnome then points towards a button on my control panel.

"You also have your own weaponry, by the way," Golmyck says. "Just press that button, and the bullets will shoot themselves. Both the front gun and the turret operate on a mechanism similar to cannons that are used on ships, except for the fact that they magically load themselves with black powder and bullets, so you only need to worry about aiming and shooting. Do try to use these bullets sparingly, though. Our ammunition is not unlimited, and these bullets cost a lot to make."

As soon as the two of us are ready to take off, the gnome signals an air elementalist nearby, and he casts a spell on the machine's propeller in order to make it rotate.

 I pull on the lever to my left side in order to increase the pitch, and the flying machine begins to slowly gain altitude.
"So, you were saying before that the bullets are only a distraction," I say, rather loudly, in order to compensate for the sound of the propeller. "What did you mean by that?"

"Oh, the real purpose of this machine is not to shoot down the dragon," Golmyck says. "What we are in fact aiming to do is to manage to place ourselves above him, and then to drop a spinning rope on him."

"A spinning rope?" I ask him, confused.

"Yes," the gnome says. "Our enchanters designed a magical rope that is made to unfurl itself and then to start spinning once it gets dropped from our small cargo hold below. The rope has been enchanted to be nearly unbreakable, and it is long enough to tie down the dragon's wings, in order to prevent him from flying. The only problem is that the dragon will need to hover in one place for quite a while and not be paying attention to us in order for this setup to work. We can't do it after the cage is dismissed, because there will be too many explosions, and the dragon will try to get away from there as soon as possible. We only have one cargo hold, and only one rope, so we can't afford to miss our chance. We shouldn't use it unless we are absolutely certain that our plan will succeed. Until then, we'll only be using bullets to attack him, in order to provide assistance to your friends and my soldiers that will be attacking the dragon at the same time."

"And what if the dragon starts breathing fire at us?" I say.

 "This aircraft is using lessathi technology," Golmyck says, "to provide us with some rather effective shielding against fire attacks. Of course, this does not make us invulnerable, and I'm not sure how long the shields can hold against flames that are as hot as the dragon's, so we should try evading his fire breath as much as possible."
As we reach a high enough level of altitude, the golden cage surrounding the dragon is slowly starting to fade.

"Get ready," the gnome tells me.

As soon as the cage disappears, all of Flower's fireballs explode at the same time, sending a very powerful gust of wind towards us, and Kate's ice cones also get launched into the dragon soon afterwards. The protections that Tyrath cast on himself during all this time help him to survive the damage, but it's clear that he didn't get out of that unscathed. What's more, the amount of damage that he needed to absorb with his magical shields also seems to have drained him of his magical energy for the time being, because he is no longer using teleportation to move around and has gone back to using his wings to fly. 

 Almost as soon as he gets away from all the explosions, the dragon uses his fire breath to attack Kate. He was rather far from her when he attacked, however, which gave Kate enough time to move her ice cage out of the way, before the flames reached her. Tyrath now attempts to make a dive towards her, but before he reaches his target, the king's soldiers activate their strange weapons in unison, and they release a very powerful bolt of lightning that hits him head on. Visibly upset, the dragon begins to rain down flames upon them, trying to dispose of them all at once. Luckily, Daren had already reached the spectator area a while ago, and as soon as he sees the flames, he uses his shield to create a large semi-transparent barrier, which defends all of the soldiers from the fire attack.
I think I'm finally starting to understand how the dragon's fire breathing works. It seems that he needs to inhale a great deal of air in his lungs before he attacks, and he also never exhales the fire right away afterwards. I'm guessing that this is because he first needs to ignite the fire, before breathing it out. This means that as long as you pay attention to his breathing, you should be able to tell when he'll attack you with fire, and you'll have all the time you need to dodge his flames, if you are fast enough.

 This information will really help me while I pilot the aircraft, because I don't think that I'd have time to maneuver out of the way otherwise.
Tyrath seems to have changed his mind again, and he's now chasing after Hadrik, who is currently in his eagle form. Even with Hadrik's speed, it still seems like the dragon is going to catch up to him soon. Maybe now would be a good time to make use of those acid coated bullets?

He also needs to wait a second or two for the fire to ignite, before he can breathe it out. As long as you pay attention to his breathing, you should be able to anticipate when he's going to shoot fire at you."

The dragon then inhales as much air in his lungs as he can, preparing to breathe his fire at us. 

I anticipate his attack, and I quickly push the control stick forward, to make us dive down, in order to evade the incoming flames. The fire breath misses us by a fair margin, but the dragon is already on our tail, and he is gaining on us. 

Damn it, move faster, you stupid machine. Move faster!

I turn the plane to the left, trying to shake the dragon off, but he easily switches his direction and he reaches us within seconds. Tyrath then dives directly towards our cockpit, and he grabs me in his hind claws, crushing me between them, and killing me on the spot.

"Understood," Golmyck says.

As soon as I make sure that I've got a clear shot at him, I press the button on my control panel, and I shoot about a dozen bullets into the dragon's right wing. The dragon screams in pain, and then he flies out of the way, preparing to make a charge at us. I decide that it's time to retreat, and I turn the plane around, in an attempt to get as far away from the dragon as possible.

I look back, towards Tyrath, and I see that he is inhaling a lot of air in his chest, preparing to attack us with his fire breath. I quickly change the direction of the aircraft in order to avoid the dragon's attack, and the flames miss us by a fair margin. The dragon is now right on our tail, but he seems to be having a bit of trouble with his wing that I shot earlier, which is causing him to fly a little slower than before.

In the meantime, Golmyck is using the turret to keep pressure on the dragon, but he doesn't get to hit him much, because Tyrath can easily tell where the bullets will be shot from the way the turret is facing, and he doesn't have much trouble dodging most of those shots.

 As the dragon gets closer to us, Hadrik finally catches up to him in his eagle form, and he turns back into a dwarf in order to smack him in the back of the head. He then quickly turns into an eagle again, and he flies away, while one of Kate's ice cones penetrates the dragon's chest. Tyrath pulls the cone out with his claw, and then he starts inhaling air to prepare his fire breath, but just as he does that, the whole air around his head gets replaced with water, and he breathes that in, instead. Realizing his mistake, the dragon immediately attempts to cough out the water from his lungs, but the water around his head does not disappear, so all he manages to do is breathe more water in with every cough.
"This is it," Golmyck says. "This is our chance! See if you can fly us over the dragon while he's busy with the water, so I can drop the spinning rope on him."

"Alright," I say. "I'll try."

The dragon is now moving up and down, shaking his head violently, in an attempt to get rid of all the water above his neck.

"There's no use fighting it," Illuna tells the dragon, in a cold voice. "That water won't go away. And you can't burn it with your flame breath either, as long as you can't get rid of all that water in your lungs. Stop struggling and accept your fate."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "How do you like drowning in mid-air, Tyrath? I'm the one who taught this technique to Illuna, you know. You were blowing all that hot air just now, but in the end it turns out you can't even defeat one of my disciples! I guess you were never a match for me after all. Aha- AHAHAHAHA!!!"

I start aiming the turret by the handles, attempting to target the dragon's wings. Once I feel that I've got a clear shot at him, I press the trigger, and I shoot about half a dozen bullets towards my target.

All six of my bullets penetrate the dragon's right wing, which makes him scream in pain and stop in his tracks. He then flies out of the way, in order to avoid getting hit by any more bullets.

"This is it," Golmyck says. "This is our chance! I will try to fly us over the dragon while he's busy with the water. When I give you the signal, pull that lever on your right. It will drop the spinning rope from the cargo hold. Do you see the lever I'm talking about?"

"Yeah, I see it," I say. "I'll wait for your signal."

The dragon is now moving up and down, shaking his head violently, in an attempt to get rid of all the water above his neck.

 "There's no use fighting it," Illuna tells the dragon, in a cold voice. "That water won't go away. And you can't burn it with your flame breath either, as long as you can't get rid of all that water in your lungs. Stop struggling and accept your fate."
"Hah!" Arraka says. "How do you like drowning in mid-air, Tyrath? I'm the one who taught this technique to Illuna, you know. You were blowing all that hot air just now, but in the end it turns out you can't even defeat one of my disciples! I guess you were never a match for me after all. Aha- AHAHAHAHA!"

"I'm about to attack Tyrath," I tell Golmyck. "Get ready."

"Understood," Golmyck says, as he grabs the control stick firmly in his hands.

I start aiming the turret by the handles, attempting to target the dragon's wings. Once I feel that I've got a clear shot at him, I press the trigger, and I shoot about half a dozen bullets towards my target.

Shooting a moving target with a mounted turret proves to be a little more difficult than I thought, and I end up completely missing half of my shots, while the other half hit the dragon in the chest, instead of his wings.

Tyrath screams in pain, and then he flies out of the way, in order to avoid being hit by more bullets. Before heading towards us, the dragon inhales a lot of air in his chest, preparing to breathe his fire at us. 

Golmyck anticipates his attack, and he quickly pushes the control stick forward, to make us dive down, in order to evade the incoming flames. The fire breath misses us by a fair margin, but the dragon is already on our tail, and he is gaining on us.

I attempt to shoot at him again, but Tyrath adeptly dodges most of my bullets while in mid-air, by paying attention to the way I move the turret. Only a few of the acid coated bullets hit him, and they don't seem to do much damage.

 "Can't this thing go any faster?" I ask Golmyck.
"I'm afraid not," Golmyck says. "I'll try to shake him off."

Golmyck pulls on the control stick as hard as he can, and the plane quickly changes its direction. This does not fool the dragon, however, who immediately matches our trajectory, without falling behind. When he reaches us, Tyrath dives directly towards our cockpit, and he grabs me in his hind claws, crushing me between them, and killing me on the spot.

 Tyrath's eyes start glowing bright red all of a sudden, and he looks more pissed off than ever. He now seems to be voluntarily increasing his body temperature to an alarming degree, because I'm beginning to see steam coming out from all over him. He must be trying to evaporate all the water from his body, in order to be able to breathe fire again. 
While Tyrath is busy heating up his body, Golmyck and I manage to position ourselves right above the dragon, and we ready ourselves to drop the rope on him.  As soon as the dragon achieves his purpose of evaporating all of the water inside him, he uses the last of his breath to exhale a large flame from his mouth, eliminating all of the water that was surrounding his head until now.

"I'm dropping the rope!" Golmyck says, as we watch the dragon gasp for air.

He then pulls on a lever to his right, and the cargo hold opens below us, dropping the rope.

 Just as the gnome said, the rope unfurls as it falls, and then it starts spinning by itself. The dragon is too busy catching his breath to look above him, and as soon as the rope reaches him, it ties itself around his wings, preventing him from flapping them any further. Tyrath looks shocked, as he starts falling towards the ground, and his first reaction is to try and break free from the rope by using the force of his wings. Failing that, he begins to chew on the rope with his fangs, while also attempting to cut it with his claws, but it's no use. As he gets closer to the ground, the dragon tries using the last of his magic energy reserves to slow down his momentum by teleporting a few dozen feet above his position a few times in a row. This does not slow down his falling speed at all, however, and eventually he hits the ground, with an extremely loud noise, creating a crater in the middle of the arena's fighting area, and sending large clouds of dust all around him.
"The dragon is grounded!" Golmyck shouts, suddenly, to everyone in the area. "Finish him off, now!"

"ENOUGH!" Tyrath shouts loudly, and a very powerful explosion of hot air originating from his position suddenly hits us all in the face.

 Following the explosion, the dragon's body changes completely, and it starts looking like it is now covered by molten lava, and not by regular scales anymore. He is also now emanating an intimidating fiery aura that is completely different from the one he had before. But that is not all. The magic power that I am now sensing from him is simply insane. If I were to compare it with anything I've felt before, I'd say that it's on a pretty similar level to the magical power of the golden fox. Is this seriously the true form of the red dragon, Tyrath? The one that Arraka was talking about earlier, before we began the fight? How are we even supposed to fight something like this? 
The rope that was tying the dragon's wings has already been burned into ashes by the dragon's transformation. Tyrath now soars back into the sky, looking more menacing than ever before.

"This is all my fault," Tyrath says, in an unusually calm tone. "I alone am to blame for having given you the illusion that you could actually stand a chance against me. I am now going to fix that mistake. Instead of continuing to fight you individually, I will simply destroy this whole city and everyone in it with a single spell. This way, there will be no more misunderstandings."

 "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, king of all dragons," says Eiden, who appeared out of nowhere again and is now floating right in front of the dragon, with his eyes closed, as usual.
"Eiden..." Tyrath says, in a mildly annoyed tone.

"See, if you'd kept fighting in your other, weaker form," Eiden says, "I might have been tempted to continue ignoring your gross violation of our pact, but now you've driven things to a point where even I can no longer gloss this over..."

"What are you babbling about?" Tyrath says. "What pact?"

"Why, the pact that you, I and the golden fox have signed several hundred years ago, of course," Eiden says. "Have you already forgotten? According to the pact, neither of the three of us are allowed to directly attack any of the other's followers. This is to avoid a fight breaking out between any of the three signing parties, because a fight between any two of us would have the potential of destroying the entire island before reaching its conclusion, and neither of us would want that. As such, any and all conflicts between the three of us are to be resolved indirectly through our followers, and not through any direct means, whatsoever."

 "Ridiculous," Tyrath says. "That old pact has long ago lost its meaning. The only reason why we signed the pact in the first place was because our powers used to be comparable. That has no longer been the case for more than a hundred years. Ever since you left the continent, you've only grown weaker, and now you are but an empty shell of your former self. If you didn't always resort to petty tricks, I would have killed you a century ago. You are no longer a threat, stillwater, and therefore, our pact is now void."
"Is it?" Eiden asks, with a wide smile. "Well, let us declare a new pact, then!"

All of a sudden, the air all around us starts to feel like it's weighing heavily on our shoulders, and the world itself seems like it is trembling. It's almost as if there was now an earthquake in the middle of the air, instead of the earth below, and the blue sky looks as if it is ready to crack any minute, under the pressure. I realize immediately that this is the direct result of Eiden unleashing his magical aura, and that this may well not even be the true extent of his power.

"Well, well," I hear Arraka talking from somewhere behind us. "I see that Eiden has finally decided to get a little bit serious."

"A little bit?" Illuna shouts at her, in disbelief.

"We never really got to name our old pact," Eiden tells Tyrath, "but we could call this new one 'The pact of the Creator's return'. What do you say, old friend? Will our words be enough this time, or should I get a pen and paper?"

 Tyrath looks at Eiden for a while, measuring him up and down, with a thoughtful look on his face.
"Perhaps I was wrong," Tyrath says. "Perhaps your travels have not made you nearly as weak as I would have liked to believe..."

He pauses.

"I do not intend to destroy the whole continent while fighting with you, stillwater," Tyrath says. "I will honor the pact, and won't interfere any longer. But know that my purpose remains unchanged. If I cannot destroy all the human cities myself, then my armies will just have to do it for me. I will not rest until every single one of these cities is burned down, whether that takes me weeks or years to accomplish. The next time you will be seeing me will be after I've destroyed everything that you've once loved and cherished in this godforsaken world. Remember this."   

As Tyrath turns to leave, Eiden calls out to him one last time.

"Oh, I forgot to mention," Eiden says, with a polite smile. "The mages that have joined the tournament will also temporarily be classified as my followers under the terms of our pact. They are our esteemed guests after all. Therefore, you are not to bring harm to any of them until the end of the tournament, unless, of course, they attack you first."

"Hmph," Tyrath says. "I will keep that in mind."

 The dragon then soars higher into the skies, and he flies away from us, in the same direction that he came from when he first attacked us.
"Farewell, king of all dragons," Eiden says, as the dragon leaves.

"Eiden!" we hear a girl's voice coming from one of the empty sides of the spectator seats. "Hey, Eiden, do you hear me?"

I look towards the coliseum, and I see that there is a young girl in her late teens standing all alone in the middle of the deserted spectator seats, and she has been shouting Eiden's name for a while now.

"Damn it!" the girl says. "Don't you dare ignore me!"

Eiden makes a bored hand wave in the general direction of the girl, and suddenly, none of the words she is speaking are reaching us anymore, although the girl doesn't seem to have realized it herself, and she still appears to be shouting louder than ever. Did Eiden just cast a silencing spell?

Eiden then turns towards the soldiers from the king's army, who are all looking at him as if they've seen a ghost. Eiden's smile widens when he sees them, and he decides to give them a parting message before he leaves.

"Well, what are you all standing there for?" Eiden asks the soldiers. "Go on, spread the news! Spread it far and wide. Rejoice, for your Creator has finally returned!"

 He then disappears once more, leaving the soldiers just as confused as they were before.
"I think it's about time we descended back to the fighting area, Barry," Golmyck says. "Our job here is done."

 "Hey, Arraka," I say. "Is Eiden still around, or is he gone for good, this time?"
"Nah, he's gone," Arraka says.

"Alright, let's get back down," I tell Golmyck, and then we make our way back to the fighting area of the arena.

Once we land our flying machine and get out of the cockpit, the king shakes my hand, and then he goes to meet his soldiers, telling me that we'll see each other again, back at the palace. Not long afterwards, Daren, Kate, Hadrik and Flower all gather one by one near my plane, so we can leave the arena together. I wave to Leila, who comes to join our group as well, and as we prepare to leave, Bruce comes to say his goodbyes.

"Good fight, stillwater," Bruce says, as he pats me hard on the shoulder. "Good fight! And the same goes for you, silver-haired princess. If we all ever get trapped in another deadly arena, I wouldn't mind having you again as my allies. Maybe we'll meet again, someday."

"Who knows?" I tell him. "It's a small continent, after all."

Both Leila and I bid him farewell, and then we join the rest of the group. Once we're all ready to go, the ones of us who participated in the arena go to grab our backpacks from the locker rooms, and then we meet back in the fighting area, in order to head towards one of the spectator exits.

 "Come on," Daren tells us. "I think I saw Enrique spectating us from somewhere around here, and I'm pretty sure that he left through one of these gates when the evacuation started. He must be waiting for us outside."
We all exit through the gate, trying to find Enrique , but before we get to even look around, we are greeted by a young girl with a pleasant smile on her face. I recognize her immediately as being the same girl who was calling out to Eiden, earlier.

"Hello!" the girl says. "I hope I'm not bothering you. It's just that I watched you fighting during the arena event, and I was very impressed! I was wondering if you all could help me out with something."

"Sorry, kid," Daren says, as he pats the girl on the shoulder, briefly. "We're not giving autographs."

He then turns his back on her and heads towards Enrique who was waiting for us not far from the gate. The girl looks mildly irritated by Daren's remark, but it does not look like she's planning to give up just yet. Taking a better look at her, I notice that her clothes, while aesthetically pleasing, do not look much different from the pajamas that they sell on the Western Continent. They remind me quite a lot of the type of clothing that Eiden likes to wear.

 "My friends," Enrique says. "That was fantastic! Simply magnificent! I have no words! I thought I'd already seen everything when you were done battling those creatures in the arena, but then you went and defeated a dragon! And to top it all off, you've survived the encounter with barely any scratches. This calls for a celebration! Tonight, we will have a feast. I will not accept 'no' for an answer!"
"Um... excuse me, sir?" we hear the young girl from before, calling out to Daren from behind us.

"Listen, Enrique," Daren says, ignoring the girl behind him, "I really appreciate all of this, but this arena event already puts us three days behind all of the other participants in the mage tournament, so I really don't think it would be a good idea for us to be spending yet another night in Thilias."

"Umm, sir?..." the young girl asks again, but nobody pays attention to her.

"Come on, Daren," Hadrik says. "Don't be a stick in the mud! They never gave us a time limit for completing the first objectives. It's not like they're going to disqualify us if we don't start looking for the pine cones right away."

"Damn it, Hadrik!" Daren says. "You are the last person that I want to hear this from. You don't even care about winning the tournament! Didn't you say that you only came here for the challenge? I bet you're only trying to postpone this because you hate the idea of having to go search for pine cones."
