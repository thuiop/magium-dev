As I stand here, in the middle of this forest, gazing at all of the explosions far in the distance, I realize I may well have crossed that line, to a point of no return.<br/>My name is Barry. I am twenty-eight years old, and  I could quite accurately be described as your everyday ordinary guy. I have no talents, no particular skills and no academic background. The only thing that defines me is my lifelong obsession to become a mage. It is what I've wished for ever since I was five years old. It has been my driving passion throughout my life, as I've constantly amassed knowledge about mages and travelled the world in the hopes of finding a way to make my dream come true.<br/><br/>After endless years of searching through dusty tomes and weathered parchments I have finally found a way to do it.<br/><br/>The catch? I need to first win a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world. Sounds crazy? That's probably because it is. But it is far too late to go back now. The only way that's left for me is forward.<br/><br/>As I stand here, knowing that it's no longer possible to return to my normal life, I can't help but feel quite...<br/><br/>",

Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence.\"<br/><br/>He is talking about the spell the organizers of the tournament cast on each of the participants before teleporting us here. We aren't allowed to hurt the humans that live on this continent, so their spell warns us when one of them is near. If what they said can be believed, their spell is supposed to stop us even before we try hurting any of the locals. If it's accidental then it simply stops us before doing it. If it's intentional, it eliminates us from the tournament and sends us back. <br/><br/>Their spell is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. They said they'll transmit the objectives to each of us individually. It's funny. All of those careful preparations on their side, and they never even bothered to check if I was a mage or not. Hell, what am I saying? They probably didn't even care.<br/><br/>\"So you must be a participant, then,\" Daren continues. \"What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?\"<br/><br/>I am after the same thing as every other participant in this tournament, Daren, but I'm not sure how wise it would be to tell you of this. <br/><br/>I'm after the prize that's being offered to the winner. The Magium.<br/>Nobody knows exactly what it looks like, or what it's made of, but everyone knows the fact that it is the source of all magic in the world, and that it can only be found on the continent of Varathia. All mages seek it. They crave it. They are certain that if they have access to it, they can increase their powers a hundredfold and become living legends. And although it is a common misconception that the Magium is only useful for learned mages, my studies have led me to believe that the Magium is so extraordinary that it can even turn a normal human into a mage.<br/><br/>I've searched very long for a way to get into Varathia, but the only way one can travel to their continent is by receiving a direct invitation. Very few of those are sent yearly, and the people being teleported there are being held under direct supervision for the duration of their stay, and return with no information regarding the coordinates of the place.<br/><br/>But when all hope seemed lost, the announcement came. A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   <br/><br/>I knew then that there would never be another chance like this. <br/><br/>\"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?\" Daren asks me again.<br/><br/>",

But that's not really an option for me at this point. All I can do now is try to survive until the end of the tournament.\"<br/>Daren pauses a little to reflect on my words.<br/><br/>\"Hold on, Barry... I think there's also another way.\"<br/><br/>\"There is?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah! Remember the rules? They said they'd eliminate us from the tournament and teleport us right back if they detected any intent to harm the locals. You could use that, Barry! You just need to find any of the humans living on this continent, try to punch them in the face, and you'll be set free!\"<br/><br/>\"I..uh... I never thought of it this way.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, I'll make sure to keep you safe until we reach one of the cities!\"<br/>\"I'm not so sure about that. I mean, I just witnessed you get completely wrecked by that knife throwing guy. How does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave, anyway?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, that...\"<br/><br/>He is sounding embarrassed.<br/><br/>\"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly...\"<br/><br/>\"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?\"<br/><br/>",
