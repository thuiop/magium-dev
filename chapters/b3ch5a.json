Before I get to answer him, the king cuts me off with a question that takes me completely by surprise.<br/><br/>\"Should I take it that you're done negotiating with the Overseer?\" he says in a casual tone, while still not taking his eyes off the sheet of paper in his hands.<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?...\" I say, trying to appear as calm as possible. \"I thought the meeting with the Overseer was scheduled for tomorrow.\"<br/><br/>The king of the underground sighs, and he stops reading his report, so he can look me in the eye.<br/><br/>\"Listen...\" the king says, with a very tired expression on his face. \"The situation is very dire at the moment, so I'm not really in the mood to play games with you and your group. I'm going to tell it to you straight. I've been suspecting that you would go see the Overseer behind my back ever since our very first meeting. That's why I made sure to have Breynan accompany you on your little trip. I wanted to have an insurance that your private negotiations would not result in any negative consequences for the people of this city.\"<br/><br/> \"Breynan,\" Kate says, with her eyebrows furrowed. \"Did you--\"<br/>\"I didn't lie to you, I swear!\" Breynan tells Kate. \"I haven't spoken a single word with the king about this!\"<br/><br/>\"You misunderstand me, Kate,\" the king says. \"I did not order Breynan to do anything. He went with you of his own accord, and he was not acting as a spy on my behalf. What tipped me off, in fact, was your behavior towards me.\"<br/><br/>\"My behavior?...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the king says. \"From our very first meeting, I could tell by the look in your eyes that you didn't trust me at all. This wouldn't have been a problem if the healer were your leader, but since he openly stated that you people generally like to take decisions as a group, my intuition told me that it would be highly unlikely for you to ever agree to work together with me and my men. That is why I told Breynan at the end of the meeting that he wouldn't be allowed to go talk to the Overseer. I knew very well that this would turn him against me, and that he would most likely end up joining you on your little quest if he saw you heading for the surface.\"<br/><br/>As I'm hearing the king's words, I suddenly remember that I noticed him taking a short glance towards Kate at the end of our first meeting with him, right before he told Breynan that he wouldn't be allowed to come with us to meet the Overseer. Did this guy seriously anticipate our actions before we even had a chance to make up our own minds about them?<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"What kind of a ridiculous plan was that?...\" Melindra says. \"You were willing to keep the person who knew the most about the Overseer out of the negotiations team simply based on a hunch? What would you have done if your guess turned out to be wrong, then? What if Daren would have convinced us to wait until tomorrow and to go with your men to see the Overseer?\"<br/>The king shrugs.<br/><br/>\"In that case, I suppose I would have just told Breynan that I've changed my mind, and that I would allow him to meet the Overseer after all,\" the king of the underground says. \"Besides, it wasn't just my initial hunch. Every one of your actions since then has done nothing but confirm my suspicions. You never let go of your backpacks even when we provided you with a room, and the ice mage has been openly announcing her distrust of me for almost the entire duration of our second meeting. By that time, I was almost certain that you would go meet the Overseer by yourselves, which is why I came up with the proposition to forge an alliance with you based on necessity and not on trust. An alliance where each of us would be free to backstab the other when it served their interests. You do remember that I said this to you, right?\"<br/><br/> \"So, what you are saying is that it is now your turn to backstab us?\" Illuna asks the king.<br/>\"Good heavens, no!\" the king of the underground says. \"I'm not planning to do anything to you. Breynan might not be all that loyal to me, but he is most certainly loyal to the people of Ollendor, so I couldn't possibly imagine him still being on friendly terms with you if you had tried to hurt our people in any way. Given that he's not saying anything, I'm going to assume that at the very least you're not working against the interests of our people. That is good enough for me. After all, your healer friend has been working tirelessly to save my men's lives in the quarantine zone ever since he came here, so it would be an insult to him if I were to treat any of you as my enemies.\"<br/><br/>\"Does this mean that you're not going to ask us what we discussed with the Overseer?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Obviously I'm still going to ask you that question,\" the king says. \"But you are free to not answer me if that is your decision. So... are you going to tell me what were the results of your negotiations with the Overseer or not?\"<br/><br/>",

How is this such a difficult concept for you to grasp?\"<br/><br/>\"It's because your words sound like gibberish!\" Daren says. \"How was I supposed to know that what you really wanted me to do was to imagine myself untying them like actual knots? I thought that I had to change the direction of each flow individually! You just don't know how to explain things clearly!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh yeah?\" Arraka says. \"Then how come the goblin understood, smart-ass? I only had to tell him once, and he got it right away. What's your excuse for that?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know, maybe you just understand each other better because you're both monsters!\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"I'm an elf, you miserable cretin!\" Arraka says. \"I already told you this once before!\"<br/><br/>\"Should I take it that you're making progress with finding the cure for the people in the quarantine area?\" Illuna says, when Daren and Arraka reach us.<br/><br/> \"So, what you are saying is that it is now your turn to backstab us?\" Illuna asks the king.<br/>\"Good heavens, no!\" the king of the underground says. \"I'm not planning to do anything to you. Breynan might not be all that loyal to me, but he is most certainly loyal to the people of Ollendor, so I couldn't possibly imagine him still being on friendly terms with you if you had tried to hurt our people in any way. Given that he's not saying anything, I'm going to assume that at the very least you're not working against the interests of our people. That is good enough for me. After all, your healer friend has been working tirelessly to save my men's lives in the quarantine zone ever since he came here, so it would be an insult to him if I were to treat any of you as my enemies.\"<br/><br/>\"Does this mean that you're not going to ask us what we discussed with the Overseer?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Obviously I'm still going to ask you that question,\" the king says. \"But you are free to not answer me if that is your decision.

Now he pretty much figured out the cause of the disease, so all he needs to do is go get the right tools for the job.\"<br/>\"Easier said than done,\" Daren says. \"The tools themselves likely won't be a problem to obtain, but from what Kelrim told me, the shops around here are running quite low on medicinal herbs. There aren't many towns willing to do trading with a rogue city like this, and the medicinal herbs that I'm looking for apparently don't typically grow in the area surrounding Ollendor. We're going to need to try out a lot of shops until we find the ointments that I need, which is going to be a little difficult, given that we're wanted criminals in this city.

He probably didn't do it intentionally, but when he said that, it immediately reminded me of his goblin friends that we murdered without a second thought before we entered the city. The fact that he's not blaming us for his friends' deaths makes it even worse. A quick look at Daren and Kate tells me that they're both thinking the same thing. Realizing that there isn't really anything he could say to make things better about what we've done, Daren decides to respect the goblin's wishes and to offer his full support.<br/><br/>\"In that case, you can be sure that I will have your back, Kelrim,\" Daren says, with a serious look in his eyes. \"I promise that I won't let anything happen to you while we're on the surface.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you,\" Kelrim says. \"For what it's worth, I will also try to make the best use of my healing abilities, if we get attacked.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch2_goblins || 0) != 1) {%> \"Are you sure?...\" Daren says. \"From what I understood, the sickness progresses much slower for goblins, so you could still wait a week or two for the city-wide lockdown to be over until you go shopping for the herbs.

What more do you want from us, you senile old hag?\"<br/>\"I want you to take initiative!\" Arraka says. \"I want you to surpass your damn limits and go way beyond them. Don't just blindly follow my training programs like some brainless puppets. You're aiming to kill a GOD! How are you planning to do something like that if you can still be so easily defeated by two measly royal guards?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't understand why you care so much about this,\" Kate says, as she is leaning with her back against a wall, while crossing her arms and looking at the amulet. \"You usually like to treat everything as a joke, but for some odd reason I never see you do that when you're talking about our training to kill the God of Time. Why is that?\"<br/><br/>\"Because this isn't a joke, damn it!\" Arraka says. \"Do you have any idea how many thousands of years I've waited to take my revenge on these self-proclaimed gods from the magical plane? After all this time, even if I were to kill them myself in the most painful ways I could think of, it still wouldn't be enough. But to have them killed by a circus troupe like you? That would be the cruelest and most humiliating death imaginable for a being made of pure magic that has reached that level of power. Ever since Barry-boy gave me that idea, I couldn't even think of a more fitting end for an arrogant sack of trash like Selkram. One way or the other, I'm going to make this happen, and you losers had better not stand in my way.\"<br/><br/> \"While it is reassuring that you're not doing things on a whim for once,\" Daren says, \"would you by any chance also happen to have some concrete advice to give us? Or are you just going to keep hurling insults at us until we get better?\"<br/>\"Oh, I'll give you some concrete advice, alright,\" Arraka says. \"Hey, dwarf!  What the hell was up with that pathetic performance you showed us earlier today against that giant buddy of yours? All he had to do was say two words to you and he completely threw you off your game! Is that how much of a wuss you are? Are two meager words all it takes to turn you from a battle-hardened warrior into a clumsy tavern brawler? If I say those two words to you now, are you going to spend a whole day moping again? Well here, I'm going to say them! Dwarf village. Dwarf village. Dwarf village. Are you going to cry now, little giant?\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka,\" Daren says, with an angry look in his eyes. \"If you say one more word, I'm going to--\"<br/><br/> \"No, she's right,\" Hadrik says. \"I should not have let him get to me like that with only a few words. If Barry hadn't managed to keep Gontrok busy while I was unconscious, he may well have killed you all, and it would have been my fault. I won't let it happen again.\"<br/>\"You'd better not,\" Arraka says. \"Because if we ever get close to finishing off Selkram and you mess up because he triggers some repressed memory of yours by saying a few random words, I swear that I will put my fingers through your eye sockets and rip your skull from your spine. On that note, how about you work on your actual combat techniques too, and not just on your mental fortitude? I've seen you practicing some new moves in the last few days, but you didn't use a single one of them in today's fight. What were you waiting for? A formal invitation?\"<br/><br/>",

That was when I decided to take my weaknesses a little more seriously and to begin testing new techniques to overcome them. Unfortunately, I wasn't really ready to use them in battle just yet, and that's how that bastard Gontrok managed to catch me off-guard, but I'll make sure to perfect my new moves tonight. I'm not taking any more chances this time around.\"<br/><br/>\"Good for you,\" Arraka says. \"Now shut up. I'm not done giving 'concrete' advice yet. Hey, Kate! I'm going to ask you this very bluntly. What is it with you and freezing attacks? Do you have an allergy to them or something? I've barely seen you use them since I've met you, even though they are by far the strongest attacks in your arsenal when used against enemy mages. It's always icicles with you. Here's an idea. How about you diversify your attacks a little instead of being so predictable?\"<br/><br/> \"I use icicles because they are the most efficient,\" Kate says. \"They have the longest range and they pack the most power. They're also hard to detect because most enemies don't expect me to conjure them so high up above unless they've already seen me use this attack once before. Given that it usually works, I don't see any reason why I should use something else.\"<br/>\"Why are you trying to dodge the main question?\" Arraka says. \"What I asked you first was why you are specifically avoiding casting freezing spells. I've seen you do this even in situations where it would have been more advantageous for you to use an ice beam instead of an icicle attack. You can't give me your efficiency excuse in these cases, so what is the real reason, then?\"<br/><br/>Kate frowns at Arraka's amulet for a few seconds, but she eventually decides to answer the question.<br/><br/> \"The reason is that I have far less control over freezing spells than I have over my icicle attacks,\" Kate says. \"I can freeze people with my ice beams, but I can't unfreeze them. Once I shoot a beam, it is out of my control. It's different from when I conjure an icicle or make a dragon out of ice. The ice is something that I can control at will, and I can also make it disappear whenever I want. The same cannot be said about any of my freezing spells. There's also the fact that shooting icicles allows me to attack my targets with pinpoint accuracy, whereas most of my freezing spells affect a larger area, so if I were to hit someone by mistake, there would be no way for me to undo the effect. If I am to use a freezing attack, it's typically going to be only when I'm absolutely certain that I won't hit any of my allies with it by accident.\"<br/>\"Bla bla bla,\" Arraka says. \"All I'm hearing is more whiney excuses. You don't know how to unfreeze people? Then learn how to do it. It's as simple as that.\"<br/><br/>\"I've already tried doing it countless times,\" Kate says. \"It doesn't work.\"<br/><br/>\"Then try harder!\" Arraka says. \"Or ask someone, for crying out loud! You have two other elementalists in your team aside from you, and one of them happens to be an ethereal. Do you have any idea how many perks you get just from being an ethereal? This girl can learn in one day what it would take a normal mage years to master. Surely there is at least something she can tell you to get you on the right track. I think she's asleep right now, though, so we probably won't be able to confirm that until tomorrow.\"<br/><br/>",

Elementalists tend to do this sort of stuff instinctively, without thinking too much. She needs the insight of another elementalist that can explain these things in a way she can understand. Otherwise, it's just going to be me talking to a wall, like most of the time when I'm trying to teach Daren something.\"<br/><br/>\"So, if Kate learns how to properly control her freezing spells, will this also help her against the God of Time?\" I say.<br/><br/> \"Not really,\" Arraka says. \"But at least it will be a good first step towards teaching her to be a bit more versatile with her spells. She can't just keep relying on the same long distance attack over and over. Maybe Flower can give her some ideas of what new spells she could come up with. I've noticed that the little girl can be pretty resourceful when it comes to this sort of stuff. Alright, so now that we've got that settled, the next thing we need to talk about is the captain of the royal guards. This one's going to be a bit tricky. Ideally, I'd like to teach you all how to counter that guy's aura manipulation technique, but I don't think I have enough time for it. With the way things are going right now, I wouldn't be surprised if you guys had a rematch with him as soon as tomorrow, so we're going to need a more immediate solution to this problem. In other words, the next time when that old guy shows up, I want you all to leave him to Daren.\"<br/>\"Me?...\" Daren says, surprised.<br/><br/>\"Yes, you!\" Arraka says. \"You said you finally understood what it means to untangle the flow of an aura, didn't you? Well, the same concept applies when an enemy tries to envelop you in his own aura so that he can push you to the ground. You just untangle his aura, and then you will be able to move freely through it. Obviously, since you're dealing with an enemy trying to attack you and not with a bunch of sick people in an infirmary, it's going to be a lot harder for you to pull it off, but if you actually put that enchanted sword of yours to good use, you should be able to handle it. You do understand how you would be able to untangle an aura by using your sword, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah...\" Daren says. \"Yeah, I think I do.\"<br/><br/><% if((locals.v_ch11_saved_rose || 0) == 0) {%> \"Good,\" Arraka says. \"Well, I believe that should be all for now. If I remember anything else, I'll be sure to let you know tomorrow. Class dismissed.

If I remember anything else, I'll be sure to let you know tomorrow. Hmm... actually now that I think about it, there WAS one last thing I wanted to discuss tonight. Hey, Rose, are you still there?\"<br/>There is no answer coming from my transceiver. After waiting for a few more seconds, Arraka calls out to her again, this time in a louder voice.<br/><br/>\"Hey, ROSE!\" Arraka shouts. \"Are you still there or not?\"<br/><br/>There is some more silence for a while, and then we hear the sound of hurried footsteps getting gradually louder as Rose gets back to her transceiver.<br/><br/>\"Sorry!\" Rose says. \"Suzie couldn't sleep, so I went to get her some snacks from the pantry. Did I miss something important?\"<br/><br/>\"No, but there was something that I wanted to ask about your time powers,\" Arraka says. \"Did Barry tell you what you need to do before the next God of Time ritual?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, uh, yes!\" Rose says. \"He said that I need to make sure that the God of Time won't be able to steal my powers again. I've been working on it, but... umm...\"<br/><br/>\"You don't know where to begin with your training?\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"No, it's not that,\" Rose says. \"I think I know what I need to do, but it's really hard to tell if I'm doing it right without some sort of way to test my results...\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

When she finally takes control of her body, I can see that Flower has a very confused expression on her face, while her eyes are darting back and forth, looking as if she were trying to process a lot of information very quickly. I'm guessing that Illuna didn't exactly give her too many details before going to sleep, and it feels like she's trying to piece together a puzzle that is missing way too many pieces.<br/>\"Umm...\" Flower says, as she turns to look at me. \"Illuna said you wanted to talk to me?...\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, actually I wanted to talk to you about the--\"<br/><br/>Instead of continuing my sentence, I stop suddenly, because I quickly realize that I haven't made any plans about how I was going to bring up this subject to Flower.<br/><br/>\"About the...\" I say again, but I can't seem to find the right words for this situation.<br/><br/> How am I supposed to initiate this conversation? I don't talk a lot with Flower in general, so I have no idea how she'd react if I were to bring up a serious topic like this out of the blue. Should I start with a subject matter that is completely unrelated and then slowly steer the discussion in the right direction? Would she even be willing to discuss her personal issues openly with me, like Illuna? How will I be able to get her to make up with Illuna when I can't even think of a way to begin the discussion properly?<br/>\"About...\" I say once more, but this time in a weak and hesitant tone.<br/><br/>\"Barry, are you okay?...\" Flower says, looking a bit worried. \"Your face is starting to get all sweaty.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine,\" I say, as I wipe off the sweat from my forehead with my sleeve. \"I was, uh... I was just going to talk to you about the... the... the weather is really nice this time of year, isn't it?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, for crying out loud!\" I hear Melindra shouting from the tunnel that she went in earlier.<br/><br/>\"Melindra?...\" Flower asks, now looking even more confused than before.<br/><br/>\"Melindra?!\" I ask, shocked, as I watch her stepping out of the corridor and then storming in our direction. \"Have you been standing there the whole time?

Every time when we talk about my age, I feel like she gets more and more disappointed for some reason. I think that she's finally beginning to get tired of my childish behavior after these past twenty years. That's why I'm trying to change. I just don't want to let her down anymore.\"<br/>\"That's not why Illuna is looking disappointed when you talk about your age!\" I say. \"It's because--\"<br/><br/>I suddenly realize that I'm not sure if Illuna's confession from earlier was meant to be a secret or not. Would she be upset at me if I told Flower that she felt guilty about the fact that the girl can no longer age because of her? Maybe it would be better if I avoided telling her that for now.<br/><br/>\"Look,\" I tell Flower. \"We had a conversation about this with Illuna a few hours ago, before we woke you up the first time in the tunnels below the seredium tower, and she specifically said that she has no problem with your childish demeanor, and also that she sees no reason for you to change. Not only that, but she even went as far as saying that you are perfectly fine the way you are. Melindra was there too. She can confirm it.\"<br/><br/> \"Well, you see, Flower, most people would consider these rocks to be nothing special,\" Melindra says. \"Not only that, but they would also consider having a rock collection and talking about it to be a very childish thing to do.\"<br/>She then turns towards me, just as I am leaning forward, examining the rocks on the floor.<br/><br/>\"Isn't that right, Barry?\" Melindra asks me, with a smile.<br/><br/>\"Uh... kind of, yeah,\" I tell her, as I now turn to face Melindra. \"I'm not going to lie. It's a bit of a weird hobby, to say the least. None of these rocks seem even remotely interesting to me.\"<br/><br/>\"People consider rock collecting to be something childish?\" Flower asks Melindra, shocked. \"Then why do you keep doing it?\"<br/><br/>\"It's because I don't care what people think,\" Melindra says, as she gets closer to Flower. \"It's my hobby, not theirs, and if they don't like it, they can think of me whatever they want.\"<br/><br/>\"But... doesn't it affect you when they say that you're acting like a child?\" Flower says.<br/><br/> \"Let me tell you a little secret,\" Melindra says. \"An important part of being an adult is to no longer care if people call you a child or not. You are who you are, and that shouldn't change to fit other people's preconceived notions of what is and what isn't appropriate to do at your age. If people insist on considering a hobby like this childish, then let them. They're the ones missing out, not you.\"<br/>\"Yes, but...\" Flower says in a more hesitant tone, but she does not continue her sentence and she falls silent for a few seconds, contemplating Melindra's words.<br/><br/>\"You don't need to change who you are if you don't want to,\" Melindra tells Flower. \"If you like the person that you already are, then stay that way. It's not worth making yourself feel miserable just to obtain some recognition from others.\"<br/><br/>\"It's not about recognition, it's...\" Flower says, and then she falls silent again for a few seconds.<br/><br/>\"It's just that Petal is my best friend and...  I don't want to be a burden to her...\" Flower says, as the look in her eyes is turning a little sad.<br/><br/>\"Why do you think that you're being a burden to Illuna?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>",

I think what she does is that she splits the damage between all the souls that she's absorbed, so even if the possessed body gets killed, she can just go into her spiritual form and jump into a new one. That's why Eiden and Eleya had to come up with that spell forbidding her to possess any hosts that are part of the civilized races, so that they could at least limit her powers.\"<br/><br/>\"Any hosts except for you, because that spell no longer recognizes you as a human after your fusion with Illuna, right?\" I say. <br/><br/>\"Right,\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" I say. \"But what if Arraka tried to possess Tyrath, instead? Isn't he like... crazy strong? And he's a monster, so the restriction wouldn't work for him.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch5_moustache || 0) == 0) {%> \"Him being strong does not mean that Arraka would gain any advantage by possessing him,\" Flower says. \"What matters is how similar in nature the two souls are, not how powerful the host is. Even if Arraka were able to possess Tyrath, she probably wouldn't be able to gain more power than a regular mage when using his body. But I doubt that she would be able to possess him. Dragons are well known for being immune to mind-affecting spells, so I wouldn't be surprised if this would make them more resistant against being possessed as well. Also, the stronger someone is, the harder it would be to possess them or to absorb their soul, so I don't think that Arraka would have any chance to take control of Tyrath even if his guard were down.\"<br/>\"I see,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Flower,\" Melindra says. \"Are you planning to do any training tonight?\"<br/><br/>\"I... think I'll pass for now!\" Flower says. \"I still feel a little tired after everything that happened yesterday...\"<br/><br/>\"Well, we still have a few hours to kill, so I guess we could play some cards for now,\" Melindra says. \"And when we get bored of that, I could show you some more of my rocks!

I'll teach you everything I know, until you will become an expert in rocks of all shapes and sizes!\"<br/>\"You are far too kind,\" I tell Melindra. \"But there is no need to spend so much effort just for my sake.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, but I insist!\" Melindra says, as she begins to take some more rocks out of her backpack. \"Flower, would you mind moving just a little to the right? I'm trying to align these rocks perfectly so that I can properly highlight the best traits for each of them!\"<br/><br/>For the next three hours or so, Melindra and Flower made sure to give me a complete rundown of every single characteristic that they would consider to be valuable for each individual type of rock, and they also showed me how these traits could blend together to bring even more 'value' to what many may consider to be just ordinary stones.<br/><br/>Obviously, even at the end of the night shift my original opinion remained largely unchanged, but at the very least I could now say that I understood what made the difference between an ordinary rock and a collectable rock in their eyes, so their hobby would no longer seem as incomprehensible and illogical as before. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch5_moustache || 0) == 1) {%> \"So, how do you wake her up if you need her while she's asleep?
