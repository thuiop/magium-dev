Processing...\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol now understands why it couldn't find your group anywhere in the ether. Having witnessed your ability to teleport, my assumption is that you all must have teleported to a safe haven where you are undetectable. Is that correct?\"<br/><br/> \"Um, yeah,\" Flower says. \"That's right... Wait, you've been looking for us?\"<br/>\"Affirmative,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol wishes to apologize for the inconvenience it has caused. Your souls were not meant to be teleported outside of your minds along with the rebels' souls. Unfortunately, the technique I used was still experimental, and it ended up affecting the whole area of the battlefield instead of targeting only our common enemies.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, it's no problem!\" Flower says. \"Everyone's fine now. So anyway, we wanted to ask you if you'd like to fight Peter and the king of the underground together with us here, on the ethereal plane. I could teleport us to them right now if you want!\"<br/><br/>\"The Overseer protocol accepts your offer,\" the green-eyed drone says. \"That was the destination that I was heading to as well.\"<br/><br/>\"Great!\" Flower says. \"Get ready, then. We're teleporting in three... two... one...\"<br/><br/>",

Oh, he's going to regret this.<br/><br/>\"What are you blabbering about?\" Peter asks me, having apparently heard my thoughts. \"What do you mean 'your own technique'? If you were trying to distract me, you should have gone with a lie that was a bit more credible.\"<br/><br/>Ah, crap. I forgot to think without words again. I'd better make sure to think faster from now on, or I'll give away all of my plans to him.<br/><br/>Okay, so the way I see it, this technique has one major weakness, which is the fact that you need to figure out what your enemy is casting very quickly, so that you can do all of the movements in reverse and somehow still finish them fast enough to counter your opponent's spell. Due to this fact, multi-step dispelling is particularly vulnerable to feints.<br/><br/>Oh, boy... I really hope I didn't think all that out loud, or I'll be making a complete fool of myself.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Can you visualize it?\"<br/><br/>I try to listen to her words, but they are not making any sense in my head. Everything feels like it's so far away... as if I were only a spectator watching the end of my life unfold before my eyes, without grasping the direct impact that it has on me, as a person. I am just so tired. The only thing I want to do now is go back to sleep.<br/><br/> \"Barry, I need to know that you understand me!\" Flower says in a panicky voice. \"I need you to tell me that-- oh my gods, you're almost gone. Barry, stay with me, please! Barry!!!\"<br/>Flower's screams are nothing more than background noise to me now. As soon as my body from the ethereal plane becomes completely transparent, the fatigue disappears, and it is replaced with a feeling of calm, as I quickly begin to lose any sense of who I am or what I had been doing until a few moments prior, and I can feel myself melding with the light around me, while my consciousness is slowly fading away.<br/><br/>At long last, it is over. At long last, I can rest.<br/><br/>",

As I predicted, the king avoids using his semi-transparent box when he sees us so close to him, and he tries to use his aura manipulation to push us away instead.<br/><br/>Flower, however does not give the king of the underground the time to use his technique, and she shoots a beam of fire at him, thus forcing him to focus all of his efforts on reinforcing the aura shield around himself.

Those fireballs will follow you to the end of the ethereal plane if they need to. There is no way to stop them.\"<br/><br/>He's right. The only way to counter this spell is to either dispel it in time or to conjure a shield around myself that is powerful enough to withstand the impact of fifty explosions. There's no way I can build a protective layer of earth or ice that is durable enough with the limited spells I have at my disposal. That is the reason why I instinctively tried to dispel it. How did the dispelling not work? I did everything correctly, and I even saw the spell being cancelled. So, then why?... Why are these fireballs still following me?!<br/><br/>",

Why does it look like he's controlling some of those fireballs manually? The whole point of this spell is that the fireballs are supposed to follow their target on their own, so that you can continue to cast other spells while your enemy is distracted. Normally, Peter should have no business directing any of the projectiles.<br/><br/>But what if...<br/><br/>What if this isn't his previous spell at all?... What if he just used his ethereal powers to create a bunch of fireballs out of nothing, in the same way that Flower made that palm tree and turned it into a cart?<br/><br/>Of course... If I think about it like this, then it all makes sense!<br/><br/>My dispelling did work! He's just trying to fool me into thinking that it didn't, so that I won't try to interrupt him and make him lose his focus on all these dozens of fireballs that he is controlling individually.<br/><br/>This is it. This is the answer that I was looking for. Now I know exactly what I need to do!<br/><br/> After I dodge a few more of the flaming projectiles, I lure them away from Peter on purpose, and once my path towards him is clear, I make a beeline for my opponent, while preparing a very simple daze spell that can barely make someone dizzy for a few seconds. <br/>Once I get close enough, I cast the spell on him and the very next moment, all of the fireballs disappear, while Peter is quickly recovering from his short stupor.<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" I say. \"I knew it! I knew that my dispelling couldn't have failed! I should have known that this would be a trick from the very beginning.\"<br/><br/>\"You are testing my patience...\" Peter says. \"You don't want me to use my actual powerful spells against you in this realm. Give up now, if you don't want to risk your life needlessly.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, was that supposed to intimidate me?\" I say. \"Because that didn't sound scary at all. Maybe you should try investing a few more points in your Bluff stat.\"<br/><br/>Instead of answering me, Peter begins to cast an even more complicated spell that if I'm not mistaken is meant to fill a huge area with endless raindrops of a freezing liquid that is cold enough to incapacitate you in a matter of seconds.

I know this is risky, but my gut is telling me that he is trying to trick me again, somehow.<br/>As I closely observe Peter, one thing about him in particular strikes me as odd. He is trying to make it seem like he's looking straight at me, but he keeps throwing short glances at something below me every now and then while he is casting his spell. When I look below me as well, in order to see what he was so preoccupied with, I notice four ropes that are getting longer and longer, and moving towards me.<br/><br/>\"You bastard!\" I tell Peter, as I do some quick movements with my hands and then send a burst of flames to burn all of the ropes. \"You were trying to fool me again, weren't you? You were just faking the freezing rain spell so that you could keep me distracted and tie me with the ropes! Do you think I'm stupid or something?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Peter says, as he now stops pretending to cast the ice rain spell. \"But I was hoping that you'd at least take a few more seconds to figure it out. I think it's safe to say that I've been underestimating you a little bit. You are for all intents and purposes a mage and a generalist in this realm, and I should treat you as such. Tell me, Barry, have you ever seen a fight between Brinhorn and Azarius?\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, I did see a few of those,\" I say. \"Brinhorn always used to insist on me coming to watch his official matches while I was still apprenticing under him.\"<br/>\"Apprenticing under Brinh--\" Peter begins to say, but then he interrupts himself, as he closes his eyes and starts to massage his forehead with his fingers. \"Never mind. I don't care if you actually were that man's apprentice or not. The point I was trying to make is that whenever two generalists fight, they have a certain way of doing battle that is not comparable to any other kinds of mage fights. Do you know what I'm talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"I mean, yeah, it would have been pretty hard to not see the difference,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Peter says. \"I only had the opportunity to see one of their duels, due to how insanely hard it is to obtain permission to leave Varathia as an Ollendor citizen, but that one duel will remain imprinted in my mind forever.\"<br/><br/>While Peter is talking, I can slowly feel the whole world beginning to spin around me, as if I'd just gulped down an entire bottle of dwarven ale.<br/><br/>\"As a former apprentice of Brinhorn, I'm sure that you will immediately recognize the famous battle that I am about to recreate before your eyes. Let us see if you can live up to your old mentor's teachings.\"<br/><br/>",

I didn't even know you could have these sensations in an immaterial plane of existence such as this.<br/>That being said, Peter has been kind enough to notify me in advance of what spell he was going to use against me, so I'm not planning to betray his expectations. Recalling the exact spells that Brinhorn cast to get himself out of this situation in one of his duels against Azarius, I begin by making flames come out of my hands, and then I use my palms like hot irons to burn both of my cheeks for a few seconds. As I struggle to endure the excruciating pain from my burnt face, I quickly conjure two boulders in the air on both sides of me, and I use them to smack myself in the face from both sides, right on the burn marks.<br/><br/>When I'm done with that, I create a bucketful of freezing-cold water above my head, and I let it drop on top of me, drenching my entire body in the icy liquid. While I am still trembling from the cold, I point towards Peter with my right hand and then I spin my index-finger counter-clockwise, while I imagine some invisible earplugs dropping from his ears.<br/><br/> \"Astounding...\" Peter says, with what appears to be genuine amazement in his voice, as he is slowly clapping, while I am still trying to stop my body from shaking violently. \"I was half-joking when I told you to live up to your old mentor's teachings, but I never expected you to go this far. You actually reproduced every single one of Brinhorn's spells from the beginning of that battle, including the rare variant of his dispelling technique that he used to get rid of Azarius' protection against his own sonic attacks.\"<br/>\"Yes, w-w-well, I was the o-o-one who taught him that dispelling technique a-a-after all!\" I say, trying my best to sound tough, even though I'm still trembling like crazy from the cold.<br/><br/>\"I must admit that I didn't think you would go through with it, even if you knew the spells that you needed to cast,\" Peter says. \"Seeing you inflict so much damage upon yourself without hesitation in the same way that Brinhorn did in that match makes me wonder if some of his craziness rubbed off on you or if it was in fact the other way around...\"<br/><br/>",

At least I know the theory behind them, so I'll just have to do my best to figure out the magical flow patterns based on the knowledge I already have. Let's give this a shot.<br/>As the manticores are still circling around me, trying to get me confused, I take advantage of the short respite that my enemy has granted me to quickly test several flow patterns that I've noticed in the past, through my many years of studying magical theory. Once I find the motions that seem to work, I visualize all of the magical particles in my head and I guide them on their path, while I play around with different levels of magical intensity until the flow reacts positively to my aura.<br/><br/>The first spell that I cast is one that temporarily enhances my sight and focus, similarly to the Observation stat from my stat device, which I am not carrying with me in this immaterial realm. As soon as my power of observation increases, I immediately confirm which of the manticores are real, because they are the only ones that are deviating from the general trajectory that the majority of the other manticores are following. My greater focus also makes it easier to keep an eye on Peter, whom I've been monitoring closely ever since he shapeshifted.<br/><br/>",

Similarly to what Azarius did against Brinhorn, Peter is in no hurry to attack me, because he knows that the more time passes, the more I will doubt myself on which of the flying monsters I need to defend myself from and which I'll need to ignore.<br/><br/> The spells that Brinhorn used to get out of this predicament are complicated, and I've never had the opportunity to practice them before, but they're the best option I've got. At least I know the theory behind them, so I'll just have to do my best to figure out the magical flow patterns based on the knowledge I already have. Let's give this a shot.<br/>As the manticores are still circling around me, trying to get me confused, I take advantage of the short respite that my enemy has granted me to quickly test several flow patterns that I've noticed in the past, through my many years of studying magical theory. Once I find the motions that seem to work, I visualize all of the magical particles in my head and I guide them on their path, while I play around with different levels of magical intensity until the flow reacts positively to my aura.<br/><br/>The first spell that I cast is one that temporarily enhances my sight and focus, similarly to the Observation stat from my stat device, which I am not carrying with me in this immaterial realm. As soon as my power of observation increases, I immediately confirm which of the manticores are real, because they are the only ones that are deviating from the general trajectory that the majority of the other manticores are following. My greater focus also makes it easier to keep an eye on Peter, whom I've been monitoring closely ever since he shapeshifted.<br/><br/>Now that I don't need to worry about losing sight of the summoned manticores anymore, I can finally concentrate on winning this battle.<br/><br/> The question is... should I continue to copy what Brinhorn did, or should I do something else? So far Peter has been reproducing the battle perfectly, but there's no guarantee that he'll do it until the end. At a certain point, he's bound to deviate from the original fight in some way and maybe it would be better if I made the first move rather than-- okay, never mind, too late for that. Peter is now diving straight for me in his manticore form. Azarius never did anything like this against Brinhorn. <br/>Is he going to transform back into his human form and cast a spell at me once he gets closer?... No, no, no, the shapeshifting process can't be done instantly, and it would leave him too vulnerable. Then is he planning to attack me while he's in his manticore form instead? Something doesn't add up, here. This has to be one of his traps again! I can feel it... I think he's trying to goad me into attacking him. Let's see if he'll reveal his cards to me if I play along a little.<br/><br/>I get into a stance and I pretend that I'm about to cast a short-range paralysis spell on him as soon as he gets closer. Okay, this should be convincing enough. Come on, Peter, show me what you're--<br/><br/>Before I even get to finish my thought process, the image of the manticore in front of me disappears, and it is replaced by Peter, who had apparently never shapeshifted in the first place, and only used illusion magic to make me think that he did. Just as he casts a paralysis spell of his own, I use my air currents to dash away from him and to narrowly avoid his attack. <br/><br/>",

The headache is nowhere near as bad as the one that I got from the botched teleportation when I was transported to the underground caverns with Leila, but that's not really saying much. This is still much worse than any hangover I've ever had, and it's greatly affecting my concentration.<br/>Of all the things that could have gotten the best of me, it just had to be poison...

I can easily tell where you are and I don't even have my stat device here to boost my magical sense.\"<br/><br/> \"You might be good at memorizing spells, but you don't seem to be very well versed in poisons,\" Peter says. \"Let me give you a hint. Time is not on your side right now. The more you wait, the more the effects of the poison will sink in, and you will lose all of your senses one by one. Your ability to detect auras will likely be the first one you'll lose, followed by your sense of smell and then your sight. I am only giving you this warning because of what little respect I still have left for you as a fellow generalist.

I might have completely forgotten about it if you hadn't mentioned it, so thank you for that!\"<br/>\"If you still think you can defeat me, then you'd better do it now,\" Peter says. \"Soon, you won't even be able to tell where I am anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, I think I might have a better idea!\" I say. \"Why don't I hold on to this secret technique for a while longer, to keep you on the edge? This strategy seems to have been working wonders so far!\"<br/><br/>Peter does not answer me and I can't see the reaction on his face since he's still invisible, but if I were to guess, I'd say that he's probably pretty pissed right now. The fact that he specifically brought up the idea of me revealing my secret techniques made his previous 'advice' seem very suspicious to me. He's clearly trying to bait me, here. If this poison were really meant to get worse over time, he would have tried to stall me instead of telling me to attack him. There really was no reason for him to tell me about all of this unless...<br/><br/>Unless his poison is only temporary and he never bothered to learn any poison spells with long lasting effects! Yes, that has to be it! Now that I'm paying some more attention to my headache and nausea, it does kind of feel like it's getting better, even though the improvement is subtle. Let's see if I can buy a little more time by taking advantage of his unfounded cautiousness around me.<br/><br/> \"By the gods, you were telling the truth!\" I say, as I am now feigning some fear in my voice. \"The poison really is getting worse! What have you done to me, you bastard?!\"<br/>\"...I warned you that this would happen,\" Peter says, in a slightly hesitant voice. \"Did you think I was bluffing? Now hurry up and use your spells, before--\"<br/><br/>\"What did you do to your aura?!\" I shout all of a sudden. \"Reveal yourself, you coward! I thought you wanted to have a fair fight!\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about, you lunatic?\" Peter says. \"The poison couldn't have possibly affected you this badly in such a short amount of time. In fact, by now, you should already be--\"<br/><br/>He pauses for a few seconds, as he slowly realizes what I've been doing.<br/><br/>\"You figured it out, didn't you?\" he asks me. \"You were just buying time so that the effects of the poison would wear off...\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" I say, as my headache and nausea have almost completely disappeared. \"And now that I'm feeling well again, we can continue to duel fair and square, like the two fellow generalists that we are! Don't you agree?\"<br/><br/>",

As Flower, the Overseer and I cast our spells at the king all at once, we can clearly see that his barriers can no longer keep up, and surely enough, a few moments later we manage to break through all of his defenses.

The voices are all coming from inside my head, and they're only getting louder. After fifteen more seconds of this, the images stop flashing and my consciousness begins to drift in and out between the ethereal and earthen plane again. As I am still struggling to regain my composure, the voices all stop at the same time. All except for one: the voice that I'd heard while we were still fighting Peter and the king of the underground.<br/><br/>'You had been warned,' the voice tells me simply, and then my consciousness flips back and forth between both planes of existence for a thousand times in a single second, while it feels like my soul is being ripped by force from my body. <br/><br/>It's getting cold. So very cold. My thoughts are all a jumble. An extreme fatigue is now taking over me as it feels like the very essence of my being is slowly fading away, along with my imagined body from the ethereal plane, which is becoming more transparent with each passing moment.<br/><br/>\"--arry!\" I hear Flower's voice as if it were some distant memory. \"Barry, look into my eyes!

Getting a better look at her, I see that not only her eyes are aflame, but her entire body is now made up entirely of fire... Or rather, the kind of fire that feels hot but for some reason is not burning me, even though she is touching me directly with it.<br/>\"Barry, I need you to think of what it was like inside the cube,\" Flower says, loudly. \"I need you to visualize it clearly inside your head. Do you understand?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes...\" I say, with my voice barely louder than a whisper.<br/><br/>Just like she asked, I try to remember every small detail that I can from the place called my 'sanctuary', and then I recreate it inside my head. I then close my eyes, so that I can see the image in my mind more clearly.<br/><br/>\"I'm imagining it now...\" I tell Flower, in the same weak voice as before.<br/><br/> \"Do you have a clear image of it?\" Flower says, in a panicky voice. \"Are you certain?\"<br/>\"Yes, yes,\" I tell her with my eyes still closed. \"I'm looking at it as I'm speaking to you. What do I do now?\"<br/><br/>I can no longer see my body from the ethereal plane because my eyes are closed, but I can tell that it's only gotten more transparent since I've started talking to Flower. I wonder how many more seconds I have left to live?...<br/><br/>\"--arry!\" Flower says, as I'm beginning to drift in and out of consciousness, catching only bits and pieces of what she is saying to me. \"Listen-- me carefully-- no time-- no matter what-- open your eyes! Do-- hear me?! Barry-- losing you! Barry!!!\"<br/><br/> It is hard to tell with my eyes still closed, but I think I'm being enveloped by the white light from Flower's teleporting spell again. Is she trying to send me back to my sanctuary? Is that why she asked me to imagine it inside my head?<br/>As I continue to visualize the empty cube in my mind's eye, the bright light from both the teleportation spell and the ether disappears, and the only thing I can see through my eyelids is complete darkness. Does this mean that the teleportation was successful? I can't tell whether my body is back to normal or not. Aside from the light disappearing, I still feel weak, and it doesn't seem like much has changed.<br/><br/>The silence around me is deafening. The anticipation is killing me. Did I get teleported properly or not? I have to know!<br/><br/>",

I still have the image of the cube in front of me right now, so I guess I should probably keep thinking of it. This is the only thing I should be worrying about. Nothing else matters. Just keep imagining the cube.<br/><br/>A whole minute passes without me doing anything other than concentrating on the image of the sanctuary which I have in my head. Or at least I think it's been a minute. It's kind of hard to keep track of time in this complete darkness.<br/><br/>It's fine. There's no need to open my eyes. I'm still conscious for now, and this is all that matters. A minute ago, I could have sworn that I only had a few seconds left to live, but somehow I'm still here. I'm still awake. Whatever Flower did, it must have had at least some positive effect, or else I wouldn't be alive.<br/><br/> As I'm still waiting for something to happen, I suddenly feel myself being drenched from head to toe in freezing cold water, and when I instinctively jump up, I quickly realize that there is now ground beneath my feet, and it no longer feels like I'm floating in an endless darkness like before. The rain is pouring down my cheeks, a sound of lightning echoes in the distance, and the wind is still blowing, although not as hard as it did at the beginning of the storm.<br/>Is this it?... Am I finally back on the earthen plane for good?<br/><br/>\"Are you planning to open your eyes anytime soon, or are you expecting me to talk to you like this?...\" I hear Flower's voice, speaking in Illuna's tone.<br/><br/>When I finally open my eyelids, I see that Flower is standing before me with flaming eyes in this plane of existence as well, except that the flames are blue, because Illuna is the one who is talking. Her body is not made up of flames like in the ethereal plane, however.<br/><br/>Every connection that I had with the ethereal plane is now gone. Even though I'm trying to switch my consciousness to the other realm, it's not working anymore. Could this be the result of my soul finally returning to my sanctuary on the ethereal plane?<br/><br/> \"There was this... darkness,\" I tell Illuna. \"It felt similar to the void that the Magium made me float around in when it almost erased me from the world, except this time I still had my memories and my identity left intact. Wait, no, that's not right... There was also something else different about this... nothingness that I was in. I didn't really get to see it because I had my eyes closed the whole time, but the darkness around me seemed almost... oppressive. Like it was trying to swallow me whole. Do you have any idea what might have happened?\"<br/>\"Ah, so that's what Flower did,\" Illuna says. \"I had some pretty strong suspicions, but I could barely get any kind of coherent information out of her through our telepathic link when I talked to her earlier. I should probably let her know that she didn't end up killing you by accident before she gives herself a heart attack out of pure anxiety.\"<br/><br/>\"She thought she might have killed me?...\" I ask, in an uneasy tone. \"Wait, what did she do?\"<br/><br/>Instead of answering me, Illuna raises two fingers in the air in front of me, signaling me to be quiet while she talks to Flower telepathically in the ethereal plane. Once she is done, she lowers her hand so that we can resume our conversation.<br/><br/>",

Let's just say that this isn't the first time when we've had to make use of the ethereal abyss, and it probably won't be the last either. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to check up on Flower. There are still a few matters left unresolved in the ethereal plane that we need to take care of.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, is Flower okay?\" I ask. \"I can't switch my consciousness back to the ethereal plane to check. Did she manage to escape from the ether?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch9_backup || 0) == 1) {%> \"Flower is... fine,\" Illuna says. \"For now, at least. I'm not entirely certain, but it's possible that her recent transformation is shielding her from the ether in some way. It is a little hard to speculate without knowing any more details about this new form of hers. Anyway, I'll be right back.\"<br/>As Illuna turns her focus back to the ethereal plane, leaving Flower's body to look in front of her with an empty stare, I decide to take a little walk around the battlefield, to see what the situation is.<br/><br/>It feels strange to not be able to see the perspective of my soul from the ethereal plane anymore, after everything that's happened. Even though I know for a fact that all the things I've experienced on that plane of existence were real, I still can't shake off the feeling that I've only just woken up from a very long dream. <br/><br/>I wish I could have explored that world more. I wish I could have tested my spells more. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to see that place again...<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch9_backup || 0) == 1) {%> While I'm busy looking for any kind of bindings to restrain the unconscious rebels with, several dozen red-eyed drones suddenly swarm the area out of nowhere, with long metal prongs coming out of their lower sides which they are using to hold some stretchers. Once they lower their altitudes, the drones keep holding the stretchers from both sides, while other drones help to lift the rebels onto them. As soon as a rebel has been successfully placed on a stretcher, the two drones that are holding the stretcher lift it into the air and leave the plaza, while new drones with additional stretchers join in so that they can take away the rest of the underground king's troops.<br/>\"The Overseer protocol will handle things from here,\" a red-eyed drone says, as it descends somewhere close to me. \"Thank you for your cooperation. If you wish to discuss further details about your alliance with the Overseer or about his future plans for Ollendor, a green-eyed drone will be waiting for you inside the palace. Have a nice day!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey wait, where are you taking the rebels?\" I say, but the red-eyed drone does not seem to be smart enough to answer any questions, so it simply flies away and leaves the plaza after having delivered its message.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Did I really switch back to my perspective from the ethereal plane for a second there, or am I just imagining things?<br/>\"You alright, Barry?\" Hadrik says, when he sees me frozen in place at the back of the group, and sweating something fierce.<br/><br/>\"You didn't... feel anything just now?\" I ask Hadrik, as I'm trying to calm myself down.<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Hadrik asks. \"What was I supposed to feel?\"<br/><br/>\"...Nothing,\" I tell him. \"I'm sure it was nothing.

It has to have been a fluke. Hadrik didn't experience anything unusual, so we're not being targeted by the Overseer again. Even if what I saw was real, I was clearly sitting inside my sanctuary, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I'm not going to get kicked out into the ether again.<br/>After the brief pause, I decide that there's no point in dwelling on this any further, and I quicken my pace so that I can rejoin the rest of the group. For the next hour or so, as we journey towards the palace, the sensation of switching my focus towards the ethereal plane does not return to me, so I don't bring it up to any of my friends. Everything is fine. There is nothing to worry about. If it didn't happen again after so much time, then I'm sure it was nothing serious and the event will never repeat itself.<br/><br/>Everything is fine.<br/><br/>",
