I need to choose my words carefully.<br/><br/>\"Uh, you see...\" I say, as I try to see Leila's reaction with the tail of my eye. \"Melindra forgot to pack her tent, and she asked if she could sleep with me for tonight.\"<br/><br/>\"And you just let her sleep with you?\" Kate asks me, suspiciously. \"Just like that?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, yes,\" I say, as I feel a drop of sweat slowly starting to form on the side of my forehead. \"She's here in my tent now, isn't she?\"<br/><br/>Leila is just looking straight at me, without reacting in any way.

Did our night together mean nothing to you?\"<br/><br/>\"Barry...

That's all there was to it.\"<br/><br/>\"And why exactly would he need to do such a thing?\" Kate asks.<br/><br/>\"If you want more details, you can ask Barry,\" Melindra says. \"In the meantime, I'll be over there, by the river bank, collecting some more rocks. You guys have fun.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, Barry?\" Kate says, as Melindra heads towards the river. \"What exactly are these details that Melindra was talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"To make things short,\" I say, \"Melindra forgot to pack a tent, and she didn't feel like asking Daren or Hadrik to lend her one, because she didn't really get along with them, so she decided to come to me instead.\"<br/><br/>\"And you simply let her sleep in your tent?\" Kate says. \"Just like that?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch8_energizer || 0) == 2) {%> \"Well, she told me several times that she didn't have any other place to go,\" I say. \"What was I to do?

Break it up. We need to get ready to leave soon, remember?\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, do you have anything to eat?\" Flower says, as the crowd in front of my tent begins to slowly disperse. \"I could make some food for you, if you want.\"<br/><br/>\"I do have some food, but I'd have to be a fool to refuse your offer,\" I say. \"What kind of dish do you have in mind?\"<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Flower says. \"The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch8_energizer || 0) == 2) {%> As soon as Flower is done conjuring the food for me, she goes over to Melindra, to see if she wants some food made as well. I take my time to savor my meal, and while I'm eating, I can't help but notice the fact that the sky is particularly dark today, without even a small glimpse of sun being visible through the clouds covering it. There's going to be a storm coming soon. I can feel it.<br/>Once I'm finished eating, I decide to begin dismantling my tent. The first thing I do is to crawl back inside and get my backpack out, but when I reach to grab it, I notice that there is also another backpack thrown on top of it. It does not take me long to realize that this backpack is Melindra's, and that she must have sneaked it inside my tent last night, while I was still asleep.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch8_energizer || 0) == 0) {%> <br/>When I wake up the next morning from the sound of people dismantling their tents, I see that there is barely any light coming through my tent from outside. As I open the tent's zipper, I realize that this is because of the fact that the sky is currently filled with dark clouds, and there isn't even a small glimpse of the sun, even though it must have risen for at least an hour. It appears that most of the others have already woken up, and presumably, have already had their breakfast.<br/><br/>Not long after I walk out of my tent, Melindra comes rushing towards me, with a fake smile on her face, and she grabs me by the arm with both her hands, pressing herself against me, just like she did yesterday.<br/><br/>\"Barry, my darling, I've had such a wonderful time last night!\" Melindra says. \"Tell me, did you sleep well after I left your tent? Because I slept like a baby!\"<br/><br/>\"Barry?...\" Kate asks me, as she's looking at me with a serious expression in her eyes. \"What is Melindra talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I thought it would have been obvious by now,\" Melindra says. \"Didn't you see me coming out of his tent last night? Surely it can't be that hard to put two and two together?\"<br/><br/>\"Damn it, let go of me!\" I say, as I pull myself away from Melindra. \"Kate, listen, Melindra only came to my tent yesterday because she forgot to pack a tent and needed a place to sleep. Nothing happened, I swear!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch8_energizer || 0) == 0) {%> \"Hmm...\" Kate says, while looking at me, not sure if she should believe me or not.<br/>\"He's telling the truth,\" Leila writes. \"I can tell by his aura.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, if Leila says that you're telling the truth, then it must be so,\" Kate says. \"I apologize for suspecting you.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmph!\" Melindra says, while frowning. \"How boring.\"<br/><br/>She then crawls into my tent, and she walks out of it soon afterwards, holding her backpack in her left hand. Apparently, she must have sneaked it into my tent yesterday, while I was still sleeping. After exiting the tent, Melindra begins to walk away from it, but then she stops in her tracks, and she turns her head towards me. <br/><br/>\"Oh, I almost forgot!\" she says, as she begins to slowly approach me.<br/><br/>Once she's close enough, she extends her right hand towards me, and she touches me with her palm on the upper side of my left arm. As soon as she pulls her hand away from me, I start to feel a strong wind blowing in my ears, although in reality, there should only be a light breeze in the air. The sound that I'm hearing in my ears because of the wind is making it very difficult for me to hear anything that's going on around me.<br/><br/>Melindra is now looking at me, with a smirk, as she leans closer, to make sure that I can hear what she is about to say.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch8_energizer || 0) == 0) {%> \"This is for making me sleep with the bugs, last night,\" Melindra says loudly, in my ear. \"Enjoy the rest of your morning!\"<br/>\"Hey, wait!\" I tell her, as she moves away from me. \"Undo the spell! Damn it, come back, here!\"<br/><br/>While Melindra heads towards the river bank, I can see the others' lips moving, but all I can hear is the sound of wind. Daren now appears to be looking at me and talking, but I can barely even make out a few words of what he's saying. Seeing that he's getting no response, Daren gets closer to me, and he begins to shout in my ear.<br/><br/>\"What spell did she cast on you?\" Daren shouts, as loud as he can.<br/><br/>\"I don't know!\" I shout back at him. \"Some wind spell. I don't recognize it. There's a constant wind blowing in my ears and I can barely hear you speak!\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Should I discuss this with her? No, no, no, it would only end up placing us in an awkward situation. But then again, if I never talk to Kate about this, things will never get cleared up.<br/><br/> Maybe I could find a way to bring up the subject in a subtle manner, without shocking her too much. I should try to let the conversation flow naturally, and when I find the right opportunity, I will introduce the idea as an afterthought, just to see how she reacts. Yeah, that could work! That's what I'll do.<br/>\"So, Kate...\" I say. \"I was just wondering about something...\"<br/><br/>\"Yes?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"You wouldn't by any chance happen to have any feelings for me, would you?\" I say.<br/><br/>Damn it, that wasn't subtle at all, was it?<br/><br/>\"...Have you lost your mind?\" Kate says, as she's looking straight at me, unsure what to make of me.<br/><br/>\"No, wait!\" I say. \"I know that it looks as if I'm just asking you this completely out of the blue, but the truth is that there was something that Melindra said to me earlier that drove me to ask you this question.\"<br/><br/>\"Melindra again...\" Kate says. \"What did she say to you?\"<br/><br/>\"Well...\" I say. \"She told me that you might have feelings for me... because of that look you gave her when she grabbed me by the arm, yesterday, while she was pretending that we were a couple.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Kate says, as she gets a thoughtful look on her face, and turns her gaze to the side. \"I see...\"<br/><br/>After a few seconds of contemplation, Kate once again looks me straight in the eye, and she continues to speak.<br/><br/>",

I just need them to get the job done.\"<br/><br/>\"But do you need them to be your enemies?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Eiden did not become my enemy when I acted like this with him,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Well, most people are not Eiden!\" I say.<br/><br/>\"But that doesn't mean that I need to change how I live my life just to accommodate others!\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"I'm not telling you to change your entire lifestyle,\" I say. \"I'm just telling you to not piss off everyone that you meet on purpose. Can't you at least do that much? Or would you rather spend the rest of our days on this journey without even being able to ask someone the simple favor of lending you a tent for the night?\"<br/><br/>Melindra is now looking at me with her eyebrows furrowed, and with another pouting expression on her face.<br/><br/> \"Fine,\" she says. \"Maybe I could change my behavior a little. But ONLY a little.\"<br/>\"Well, it's a start,\" I say. \"Anyway, I think we should be getting ready to leave soon. I see that the others are almost done with dismantling their tents, so I'm guessing that they've already eaten their breakfast.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, we're already done eating,\" Melindra says. \"You should talk to Flower about making you some food. She remembered some new recipes after watching the arena, which are supposedly rare dishes, meant for kings. Archer porcupine pie and trampler stew, I think they were called. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and grab my backpack from inside your tent.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, when did you leave your backpack in there?\" I say, as Melindra crawls into my tent.<br/><br/>\"I flew it over you with my wind magic while you were still asleep,\" Melindra says. \"Okay, I found it.\"<br/><br/>She then exits my tent with her backpack in her hand, and she heads towards the river bank, to collect more of her rocks. Once I'm done dismantling my tent and handing it back to Hadrik, I go to Flower, in order to ask her to magically create some food for me. I spend the next twenty minutes or so savoring my meal, and then I go join the others, who seem to be preparing for our departure. Once we're all ready to go, Melindra takes the lead, and we all begin to follow her, as we walk along the river's bank, just like yesterday.<br/><br/>",

We're not planning to stay here much longer. And Melindra, maybe next time, you could ask me or Hadrik for a spare tent, instead of barging into people's tents in the middle of the night. Just a suggestion.\"<br/>\"I'll keep that in mind!\" Melindra says, with a smile.<br/><br/>\"Alright, let's get going, Hadrik, Flower,\" Daren says, as he heads towards his own tent.<br/><br/>\"All night long...\" Hadrik says, with a tear in his eye, while still trying to contain his laughter. \"Oh, boy, what a way to start the morning.

It was greatly appreciated.\"<br/><br/> \"Any time,\" I say, in a dry tone, and then Hadrik, Leila and Flower move away from me, as Flower takes one last look towards me, with a worried expression on her face.<br/>\"Well, that was fun!\" Melindra says. \"Now, what's for breakfast?

Just wanted to clear things up.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh... thanks?...\" I tell him, not sure how else to respond to his little speech.<br/><br/>\"Alright, glad we had this chat!\" Hadrik says, as he pats me hard on the back. \"Don't worry about the others, I'm sure they'll loosen up soon enough.\"<br/><br/>With these last words, he goes to catch up with the rest of the group, and I soon follow him as well.<br/><br/><% } %>",

After I give the tent back to Hadrik, I head over to the river bank, to return Melindra's backpack. When I reach her, Melindra was just about to finish her meal.<br/>\"Here,\" I say, as I throw Melindra her backpack. \"You forgot this.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, right,\" Melindra says. \"Thanks.\"<br/><br/>She then takes one final bite from her own porcupine pie, thus emptying up her plate.<br/><br/>\"You know...\" I tell her. \"I have to admit that I was a little surprised when you just admitted to Kate earlier that nothing happened last night. I thought that you were going to cling to me like yesterday, in order to provoke another reaction from Kate.\"<br/><br/>After I finish my sentence, Melindra just stares at me, in disbelief, for a few seconds.<br/><br/>\"What kind of a heartless monster do you take me for?\" she says, eventually. \"Of course I wouldn't put you in a position like that after you just helped me out!\"<br/><br/>Her answer takes me by surprise. It takes me around two or three seconds to recollect my thoughts, before I speak again.<br/><br/> \"Huh...\" I say, as I give her a long, pondering look. \"So, you ARE capable of giving a damn about other people, then... But why would you choose to act the way you do, if that is the case?\"<br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Well,\" I say, \"from what I've seen of your behavior yesterday, you never really seem to care about what people think of you. You don't make an effort to remember anyone's names, you don't stop to think whether speaking your mind bluntly would annoy the people around you or not, and you didn't give me the impression that you'd care much if your habit of provoking reactions from people would cause the others to become upset at you.\"<br/><br/>\"And why would I care if the others become upset at me?\" Melindra says. \"I don't need them to be my friends. I just need them to get the job done.\"<br/><br/>\"But do you need them to be your enemies?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Eiden did not become my enemy when I acted like this with him,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Well, most people are not Eiden!\" I say.<br/><br/> \"But that doesn't mean that I need to change how I live my life just to accommodate others!\" Melindra says.<br/>\"I'm not telling you to change your entire lifestyle,\" I say. \"I'm just telling you to not piss off everyone that you meet on purpose. Can't you at least do that much? Or would you rather spend the rest of our days on this journey without even being able to ask someone the simple favor of lending you a tent for the night?\"<br/><br/>Melindra is now looking at me with her eyebrows furrowed, and with another pouting expression on her face.<br/><br/>\"Fine,\" she says. \"Maybe I could change my behavior a little. But ONLY a little.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, it's a start,\" I say. \"Anyway, I think we should be getting ready to leave soon. I see that the others have already dismantled all of their tents, and they're grabbing their backpacks.\"<br/><br/>Melindra and I grab our backpacks as well, and we join the others, who are just about done preparing for our departure. Once we're all ready to go, Melindra takes the lead, and we all begin to follow her, as we walk along the river's bank, just like yesterday.<br/><br/>",

If it were a curse or something, it would be right up my alley, but this is more likely a spell that is taking advantage of her elemental powers somehow. I think it would be better if we tried to convince Melindra to undo the spell herself!\"<br/>\"Well, she said 'Enjoy the rest of your morning!' so I don't think that she's planning to dispel it anytime soon,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Maybe she'll change her mind!\" Daren shouts. \"Anyway, you go dismantle your tent and eat breakfast, and we'll see what we'll do after that.\"<br/><br/>As Daren goes back to dismantling his own tent, Flower comes over to me to ask me something. However, I can barely understand half of the words she is saying.<br/><br/>\"Barry-- anything to--?\" Flower says, as the sound of the wind in my ears prevents me from hearing her full sentence. \"--make some-- you want.\"<br/><br/>\"WHAT?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"I was asking if you would like me to make you something to eat!\" Flower shouts, after she gets closer to me.<br/><br/> \"I have some food of my own in my backpack,\" I say, \"but I would have to be a fool to refuse any of your cooking. What kind of dish do you have in mind?\"<br/>\"Well,\" Flower shouts. \"The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!\"<br/><br/>As soon as Flower is done conjuring the food for me, she goes over to Melindra, to see if she wants some food made as well. I take my time to savor my meal, and once I'm finished eating, I decide to dismantle my tent. I then give the tent back to Hadrik, and I prepare myself for our departure.<br/><br/>When we all gather to leave on our journey once more, I take one long look at the sky, and see that the sky has gotten even darker since I've woken up. I have a feeling that a storm might be coming soon. As I stand there, looking up at the sky, I suddenly see a blue message floating in front of my face.<br/><br/>\"Daren's been asking for the past ten seconds if you're ready to leave...\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"What?\" I say, as I turn my head towards the others.<br/><br/> Everyone is currently looking at me, including Daren, who has a mildly upset look on his face.<br/>\"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go,\" I instinctively shout at them, even though they're all rather close to me.<br/><br/>Daren smacks his forehead hard with his right hand, and then he begins to argue with Melindra, although I cannot hear a word of what they are saying. From what they are gesticulating, I'm pretty sure that Daren is trying to give her reasons of why it would be a bad idea for me to remain deaf for the duration of our journey. It takes him a while, but he eventually manages to convince her to undo her spell, and Melindra makes a circular motion with one of her hands, as I can feel the wind from her spell gradually stop blowing in my ears.<br/><br/>\"I undid the spell,\" Melindra says. \"He can hear us now.\"<br/><br/>\"Finally,\" Daren says. \"Now come on, let's get going. We've wasted enough time already. Melindra, lead the way.\"<br/><br/>Just as Daren asked, Melindra goes to the front of the group to lead us to our destination, as we all begin to walk along the river's bank once more.<br/><br/>",

He took their side...\"<br/><br/>\"He did what?...\" Hadrik asks.<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Melindra says, as she suddenly realizes what she's done. \"I don't think I should have told you that.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, so Eiden fought against the stillwaters in the still winter?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Oh, yeah, he killed plenty of them during that time,\" Arraka says. \"Almost as much as me!\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Kate asks. \"Weren't you the leader of the stillwaters during the still winter war?...\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, no, no, no,\" Arraka says. \"Therius was their leader. I was just fused with him. And the two of us weren't exactly friends. We tried to take over the body from each other constantly. But the most hilarious thing happened when he had to go to sleep for the first time. There was no way for him to stop me from taking over his body anymore, so I wreaked havoc all throughout his camp. Those idiots tried to kill me along with him, but I squashed them like bugs. I still left half of them alive, though, so that I could play some fun games with them. You should have seen Therius' face when he woke up to see the dead bodies of his friends. And the funniest part was that none of his friends would ever follow him of their own free will after that, so he had to lead them through fear and intimidation from that moment onwards. Oh, man, those were the days!\" <br/>\"But what triggered the still winter?\" Kate asks. \"Why were the lessathi and the stillwaters at war with each other? And why wasn't Eiden on the side of the stillwaters?\"<br/><br/>\"Do you seriously think I was paying attention?\" Arraka says. \"I only just told you that I massacred half of my own army in one night. It's not like I cared to hear their reasons for going to war.\"<br/><br/>",

Remember to stick together, and to watch out for falling trees.\"<br/><br/>\"We're going this way,\" Melindra says, as she takes the lead. \"Follow me.\"<br/><br/>We follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots.<br/><br/> \"Stay close together!\" Daren shouts, in order to make sure that we can hear him through the sound of the wind. \"And watch out for lightning. We should always be careful to have tall trees surrounding us, so the lightning will strike them instead of us. Make sure to avoid flying at all costs. Come on, keep moving!\"<br/>As we advance through the storm, the wind finally manages to blow a few trees out of their roots, but we all manage to avoid sustaining any injuries by being alert and by paying attention to our surroundings.<br/><br/>We keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?<br/><br/>",

You were less than a second away from dying right now, Barry. Do you understand that? Next time, you won't be so lucky. You're going to let Melindra cast that damn energizer spell on you, and that's final! No more excuses!\"<br/>\"Yeah...\" I say. \"I think you're right. That was way too close... Melindra, you can cast the second energizer spell on me whenever you're ready.\"<br/><br/>Upon hearing my words, Melindra gets close to me, and she says an incantation, while pointing her hands towards me. As soon as she's done, I can feel my headache going away, along with my nausea and my feeling of fatigue. However, for some reason, I'm feeling nowhere near as energetic as I was the first time when she cast the spell on me.<br/><br/>\"Is it just me, or does the spell have less of an effect this time around?\" I ask Melindra.<br/><br/> \"Well, that is to be expected when you cast an energizing spell twice in a row,\" Melindra says. \"Not only does it have less of an effect, but it lasts for a shorter time as well. It should, however, hold you at least until we make camp.\"<br/>\"Okay,\" Daren says. \"Now that we've got this problem out of the way, let's keep going. As long as we all pay attention, we should be able to avoid other falling trees easily enough.\"<br/><br/>We keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?<br/><br/>",

No, no, no, it would only end up placing us in an awkward situation. But then again, if I never talk to Kate about this, things will never get cleared up.<br/>Maybe I could find a way to bring up the subject in a subtle manner, without shocking her too much. I should try to let the conversation flow naturally, and when I find the right opportunity, I will introduce the idea as an afterthought, just to see how she reacts. Yeah, that could work! That's what I'll do.<br/><br/>I leave my backpack next to the tree stump, and I head over to Kate, who is still eating her lunch by herself. When I reach her, Kate notices me, and she stops eating, as she looks towards me to see what I want.<br/><br/>\"Hey...\" I say, as I place myself in front of her. \"I was wondering if I could talk to you about something.\"<br/><br/>\"Sure,\" Kate says, as she places her plate on the ground beside her, and then she looks me straight in the eye, to show me that I now have her undivided attention. \"About what?\"<br/><br/> Alright, Barry, this is it. Just remember: act natural, and be subtle.<br/>\"There's this thing that's been on my mind since yesterday evening, and I just can't seem to get it out of my head...\" I say. <br/><br/>I then take a short pause before I continue.<br/><br/>\"You wouldn't by any chance happen to have any feelings for me, would you?\" I say.<br/><br/>Damn it, that wasn't subtle at all, was it?<br/><br/>\"...Have you lost your mind?\" Kate says, as she's looking straight at me, unsure what to make of me.<br/><br/>\"No, wait!\" I say. \"I know that it looks as if I'm just asking you this completely out of the blue, but the truth is that there was something that Melindra said to me yesterday that drove me to ask you this question.\"<br/><br/>\"Melindra again...\" Kate says. \"What did she say to you?\"<br/><br/>\"Well...\" I say. \"She told me that you might have feelings for me... because of that look you gave her when she grabbed me by the arm, yesterday, while she was pretending that we were a couple.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Kate says, as she gets a thoughtful look on her face, and turns her gaze to the side. \"I see...\"<br/><br/>After a few seconds of contemplation, Kate once again looks me straight in the eye, and she continues to speak.<br/><br/>",

We're barely moving forward with this wind pushing us back, and at this rate, half of us will wear ourselves out before we even get into a fight.\"<br/><br/>\"Even I am forced to agree with the ice mage,\" Melindra says. \"Trying to walk through this storm is a complete waste of our time.

And I don't think they were exactly on the best of terms before that, either.\"<br/><br/>\"Their relationship had been slowly degrading for a long time,\" Melindra says. \"I think it all started when the cities in Eiden's care began to introduce the concept of slavery, and it all went downhill from there. The fox had always blamed Eiden for all the messed up things that ended up happening in his cities. She kept saying that if he would have reined them in and imposed stricter rules on them, it wouldn't have gotten to this point. But back then, Eiden had this naive belief that all humans are inherently good, and that as long as they'd be left to their own devices long enough, they would find the right path. He thought that as long as people were given everything they needed, without having to work for it, and as long as they were given no reason to fight each other, they'd all live like one happy family. Well, we can all see how that turned out.\"<br/><br/>\"So, are you telling me that he just gave up?!\" Daren shouts, all of a sudden. <br/><br/> \"Oh, no, he didn\u2019t 'just' give up,\" Melindra says. \"He tried to reason with them for a long time. Much longer than your lifespan. And he did manage to lead them back on the right path a few times. But the more his expectations got betrayed, the more he stopped caring. I think it was when the people he trusted the most betrayed him that he finally lost it. I don't even remember their names. The king and queen of one of the cities. They seemed like such nice folk too... until it was uncovered that they were secretly running an underground show where people were getting eaten alive by dogs. I remember that after Eiden found out what they were doing, he organized a whole arena event just to have the king and queen eaten alive by the very dogs that they were using in their own events. It was shortly after this whole episode that Eiden told me he was finally giving up, and it was also around that time that he began closing his eyes.\"<br/>\"So he was just going to let those bastards do what they wanted?\" Daren says, furiously. \"What about all the innocent people in those cities that had nothing to do with all the atrocities?\"<br/><br/> \"He stopped caring about them,\" Melindra says. \"He started calling them all sheep, and he said that they deserved everything that was happening to them. He even started to encourage some of the more messed up things that were happening in those cities, saying that it was 'what the people wanted'. It was around that time that the fox started to really lose her faith in him, and also when she began to impose all those ridiculously strict rules in her own kingdom, in order to avoid what happened in Eiden's cities at any cost. Eventually, Eiden just left the continent without a word, on a journey of self-discovery, or whatever the hell it was, and when he came back for the first time, twenty years ago, he heard about the animal hunting going on in Olmnar and... well I think you all know what happened then. That's when he had his official falling out with the fox, and then he left the continent again, soon afterwards.\"<br/>\"Yeah,\" Arraka says. \"He probably tried to tell her that he solved the problem by destroying Olmnar, when it was in fact his departure that caused the animal hunts to begin in the first place. What a moron!\"<br/><br/>\"Uh...\" Hadrik says. \"I'm not trying to interrupt or anything, but weren't Eiden and the fox just two old allies from the still winter? Why was Arraka joking about Eiden trying to win her heart back, earlier? Why does it matter if they had a falling out or not?\"<br/><br/>",
