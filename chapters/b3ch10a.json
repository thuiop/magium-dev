We came here as you asked. We would like to discuss our future plans with you now, if you don't mind!\"<br/><br/>Aside from the echo of Daren's voice, we do not get any answer. There were no guards at the entry of the castle that we could ask for details before we came in, and no red-eyed drones waiting for us either. When we opened the door to the palace, we saw that the inside of the building was empty as well. It wasn't missing the jewelry and ornaments, like the castle from Thilias, but there were no sentries of any kind and there was no sound coming from the other rooms. <br/><br/>If the architecture of this building is in any way similar to the Thilias palace, then the door in front of us should normally be leading us to another hallway that is directly connected to the throne room. The Overseer did call us to the palace, but he never specified in which of the rooms we were supposed to meet up with him.

Maybe there's hidden treasure in this castle!\"<br/><br/>\"You're not allowed to do anything until you get rid of these flames,\" Illuna tells Flower. \"You promised that you'd deal with it, so deal with it!\"<br/><br/>\"But I'm so tired from leading all those rebels in the ethereal plane to their sanctuaries!\" Flower says. \"Couldn't I just take a teeny weeny little break?\"<br/><br/>\"You'll get your break once you finish what you're supposed to do,\" Illuna says. \"Now get back to work.\"<br/><br/>\"Fine...\" Flower says. \"I'll see what I can do.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch8_overseer2 || 0) == 0) {%> <br/>\"Hey, the voting's almost over,\" Daren says to us. \"Pay attention!

During this time, Flower and Peter have been very busy guiding all of the rebels' souls back to their sanctuaries in the ethereal plane, and once the last of them woke up, the king of the underground called for an urgent meeting, so that all of the underground denizens could democratically choose who would be their proposal for the new king of Ollendor, now that the old king was dead.<br/><br/><% } %>",

It's very serious.\"<br/><br/>\"I understand that, but... isn't there some way you could help her?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Unfortunately, no,\" Illuna says. \"I do not have much knowledge about ethereals, and Arraka hasn't exactly been of much help either.

Petal, can Melindra put me down just for a little bit so I can get closer to the podium? Pretty please?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Illuna says, as Flower's eyes now begin to glow with a bright blue color, to signify that Illuna is the one talking. \"We both agreed that you won't be moving by yourself until you can undo your transformation that makes your eyes glow and your aura burn. It's too risky for you to make any sort of physical effort on this plane of existence, considering how much strain your evolved state is likely putting on your body. If you want to walk by yourself, then you should try putting all of your efforts into finding a way to turn back to normal instead of complaining.\"<br/><br/>\"But I have been trying to do that!\" Flower says. \"I've been trying really hard!

If she doesn't learn to transform herself back to normal at will, she could easily burn herself out. This isn't a matter that we can just put on hold until later. It's very serious.\"<br/><br/>\"I understand that, but... isn't there some way you could help her?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Unfortunately, no,\" Illuna says. \"I do not have much knowledge about ethereals, and Arraka hasn't exactly been of much help either. Right now, Flower is the only one who can figure out what happened to her, and how to undo the transformation.\"<br/><br/>\"So, I'm just throwing around ideas here,\" Hadrik says, \"but don't you think you might have a better chance of getting help from Arraka if you would open her locket?\"<br/><br/> \"That is indeed a possibility,\" Illuna says, as she looks at the amulet hanging from her neck, from which we can hear the continuous muffled sound of Arraka trying to shout at us. \"Let us test out your hypothesis.\"<br/>She then briefly opens the amulet's locket, so that we can hear what Arraka has to say.<br/><br/>\"--and when I'm done with your families, I will kill you in the slowest, most painful way you can imagine!\" we hear Arraka shouting. \"Your eyes will melt from your face, while your heads will feel like they are exploding a thousand times per second--\"<br/><br/>\"It looks like your hypothesis was slightly incorrect,\" Illuna says, after she closes back the locket. \"Arraka did not in fact become more helpful when I opened up the amulet. Perhaps a little spinning could make her slightly more cooperative. Would anyone care to give it a try?\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"So, what do we do now?\" Hadrik says. \"Do we stay here in these caverns, or...?\"<br/>\"I think we should go to the surface and do some shopping, for now,\" Daren says. \"It's probably going to be a while before we visit another city.\"<br/><br/>\"Agreed,\" Kate says. \"Let's go to the teleporter room. I think I saw the new teleporting engineer heading out of this room earlier, so we should most likely find him at his post.\" <br/><br/>We spend the next ten minutes or so walking to the teleporter room and talking about the election. Once we reach our destination, the teleporting engineer that replaced Barry Thundercloud hits a few buttons on his control panel and he sends us to the surface, in the middle of a shopping district.<br/><br/>From the looks of things, it seems that some of the citizens have already noticed that the lockdown was over, because there were a few people entering the shops here and there, even if not that many. As we are still deciding which shop to visit first, we suddenly hear Flower gasping loudly, while she is still being carried by Melindra's air currents.<br/><br/>\"I think I got it!\" Flower says, in a loud voice. \"Melindra, can you put me down for a second?\"<br/><br/>\"Huh?\" Melindra says. \"Oh yeah, sure.\"<br/><br/> She then waves her hands towards her, and Flower is gently lowered to the ground.<br/>\"Thanks!\" Flower says. \"Alright, here I go. Wish me luck!\"<br/><br/>Before any of us have the time to ask what she's doing, Flower begins to squeeze her fists really hard, while her arms are trembling in front of her. As she is apparently gathering every ounce of focus that she has in order to concentrate on her current task, her eyes begin to gradually turn back to their normal green color, while the invisible burning flames in her aura also seem to be slowly getting extinguished.<br/><br/>A few seconds later, Flower returns completely back to normal, with a big smile on her face.<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" she says, happily. \"I did it! I can't believe I managed to do it! I have it all under control, now! Look!\"<br/><br/>She then squeezes her fists again, and her eyes begin to turn back to their glowy red color from earlier. Right in the middle of her transformation, her eyes turn blue all of a sudden and Flower smacks herself in the head very hard, which causes her eyes to turn back to normal immediately.<br/><br/>\"One minute!\" Illuna says. \"All I ask is for one minute without you doing something stupid! Can you not at least rest a little before you transform again? What if you got stuck again, and couldn't turn back? What then?\"<br/><br/> \"Sorry!\" Flower says. \"I guess I just wanted to brag a little. I won't do it again, I promise!\"<br/>\"You can practice your transformations all you like after you get a good night's sleep,\" Illuna says. \"All I'm asking is that you don't take this lightly. You've been doing high-distance teleportation throughout the ethereal plane all day. It's a miracle that you didn't reach your limit yet. Let's try not to tempt fate any more than we already have, shall we?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, Petal,\" Flower says. \"I understand.\"<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Can I say just one more thing?\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"What?\" Illuna asks, in an apprehensive tone.<br/><br/>\"Now that we're done with the election and everything,\" Flower says, \"could we maybe pay a really quick visit to that building from Ollendor where Melindra told me that there's a puzzle piece lying in wait?\"<br/><br/>\"Unbelievable...\" Illuna says. \"After everything we've been through, you're still thinking about your puzzle pieces...\"<br/><br/>",

I'm sure that I must only be having some small trouble adjusting my perspective after all those times when the ether forced my consciousness to go back and forth between the ethereal and earthen planes. If I give it one more day, this sensation will probably go away by itself. It has to!<br/><br/>\"No, it's nothing!\" I say. \"I was just testing some flight maneuvers and I messed up a little. All good!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, don't try anything too dangerous,\" Melindra says. \"There are some really oddly-shaped rooftops below. You wouldn't want to crash into any of them, trust me!\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I'll try to be more careful!\" I say, and then I start to follow Melindra through the sky again, along with the others.<br/><br/>We continue our journey for a while longer, and during this time, the sensation of my consciousness switching between planes does not happen to me anymore.<br/><br/>It's fine. I have this under control. A few seconds here and there of going back to the ethereal plane is not that big of a deal. I'll only start worrying if things get worse.<br/><br/> Before I get the time to think about this any longer, Melindra tells us that we've arrived at our destination, and she signals us to land in front of a very old-looking building. Unlike all the other buildings with crazy designs made by Billy Bob, this particular house looks refreshingly simple, just like any other house that you'd expect to see inside a city.<br/>\"Oh, good!\" Melindra says, once we're all on the ground. \"The old house is still here. I was a little worried that they might have demolished it by now. Okay, let's go inside. I'll show you how to open the passage to the ruins below.\"<br/><br/>\"Ruins?...\" Flower asks, confused, as we are now entering the building. \"I thought you said that the puzzle piece was supposed to be inside the house!\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Melindra says. \"What I told you was that you needed to go inside the abandoned building in order to get to the puzzle piece. I never said that it was hidden in the building itself. Anyway, it's just some lousy ruins. I already know which levers we need to pull, so it will be over in a few minutes. Don't worry about it.\"<br/><br/>\"And what if you remember the levers wrong?\" Kate asks her.<br/><br/>\"I am not remembering them wrong,\" Melindra says, while she presses on a few stones from the ground in quick succession. \"I've already done this a few times before, so I know exactly what I'm doing.\"<br/><br/>Just as she is done talking, the middle of the floor opens itself up, revealing a hidden staircase to us.<br/><br/> \"See?\" Melindra says. \"I told you that I know what I'm doing. Alright, now we need to take these stairs all the way down. Come on!\"<br/>\"Are there any blue crystals down there, or do we need some light?\" Flower asks Melindra, as we begin to descend the stairs.<br/><br/>\"No, there are no crystals, as far as I recall,\" Melindra says, \"but I think there are some torches that we can light.\"<br/><br/>\"Gotcha!\" Flower says, as she conjures three small balls of flame that are floating next to us, so that we can see where we're going.<br/><br/>Once we reach the ruins below, Flower uses her balls of fire to light all of the torches on the walls, and then she makes her magic flames disappear.<br/><br/>\"Wow, that's a lot of levers...\" Flower says, when she gets a good look at the corridor walls.<br/><br/>\"Okay, pay attention!\" Melindra says. \"There's a very specific order in which these levers need to be pulled, with some waiting times in-between. I will handle all of it, but when I get to the final lever, whoever wants a puzzle piece will need to stand over there, by the wall, because the puzzle piece dispenser will only be available for a short time. Got it?\"<br/><br/>\"Got it!\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" says Melindra. \"Here I go, then.\"<br/><br/>",

The place made of pure darkness where you sent me to escape from the ether?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Flower says. \"Remember how you couldn't manage to return to your sanctuary by yourself from there, and Petal had to pour some cold water on you on the earthen plane in order to wake you up?\"<br/><br/>\"I remember, yeah,\" I say.<br/><br/> \"Well, that wasn't the proper way to do it,\" Flower says. \"Petal only did it as an extreme measure, because you couldn't wake up by yourself, and we were hoping that it would be enough, but I'm starting to think that it wasn't.\"<br/>\"So, what does that mean?...\" I say, while my eyes are still closed. \"What do I do now?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... maybe you could... live the rest of your life with your eyes closed?\" Flower says, in a meek voice.<br/><br/>\"What?!\" I shout.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" Flower says, in a panicky voice again. \"It's just that this has never happened before. I have no idea what you should do! The only thing I know is that as long as you keep your eyes closed both here and on the ethereal plane, the abyss shouldn't be able to hurt you.\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"You do have your eyes closed on the ethereal plane too, don't you?...\" Flower asks.<br/><br/>\"How am I supposed to know that?\" I say. \"I can't check if I'm still switching between the planes while I have my eyes closed!\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, but can't you feel it?\" Flower says. \"With your magical sense, I mean?\"<br/>\"I can't differentiate the auras from the ethereal plane from the ones on the earthen plane!\" I say. \"I wouldn't even know what difference to look for! Isn't there anything else I can do? Anything at all?\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, well... you're not dead yet, so that's a good start...\" Flower says, with her voice still shaky. \"Maybe if we-- Maybe if I-- if I--\"<br/><br/>\"Flower, calm down,\" I hear Flower's voice again, but this time in the tone of Illuna. \"Think about this rationally. The abyss cannot affect the ether any more than the ether can affect the abyss. Even if the abyss wanted to bring him back, there would be no way for it to reach him.\"<br/><br/>\"Then how is this happening?\" Flower says, still sounding panicked.<br/><br/>\"A small piece of darkness must have travelled with him when he made the return trip,\" Illuna says. \"Considering that he's not already dead after all this time, my guess is that the darkness has attached itself to the exterior of his sanctuary and it's trying to make its way in. If you can reach Barry's mind from the ethereal plane, you should easily be able to cleanse the darkness with your fire.\"<br/><br/>\"But I don't know where Barry's mind is!\" Flower says. \"We never reached it the last time when I tried to lead him there!\"<br/><br/>",

Normally, the inside of your sanctuary should feel different to the touch than the floor and the walls from these ruins. Try sitting on the ground here, and then touch it with your hands. If you are being tossed around between the two planes of existence, you should feel the texture of the floor change beneath your palms.\"<br/>\"Good idea,\" I say, with my eyes still closed. \"I'll do that right now!\"<br/><br/>Almost immediately after I sit down on the floor and put my palms on it, I can feel the ground changing rapidly between the cold hard stone of the underground corridor to a warm, soft texture that I've never felt before. It's working! I now know that I'm still switching!<br/><br/>\"Okay, I can confirm that I'm still being sent back and forth between the two planes,\" I say. \"What do you want me to do?\"<br/><br/>\"I want you to concentrate on your palms,\" Illuna says, \"and to imagine that you are sending magical energy throughout the whole cube that you are currently inside of, in the ethereal plane. Do you think you can do that?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I think I can,\" I say, as I try to do what Illuna said.<br/><br/>\"In the meantime, Flower, you're going to need to transform back into your evolved state and see if you can detect a sanctuary with magic overflowing from it,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/> \"But you said that I shouldn't transform again until--\" Flower says, but she is interrupted.<br/>\"Never mind what I said,\" Illuna tells her. \"This is an emergency. If you know how to turn back to your evolved form, do it now.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay...\" Flower says. \"Okay! I'm doing it right away!\"<br/><br/>\"So, I don't mean to alarm anyone,\" I hear Melindra's voice from somewhere close to me, \"but if I don't keep pulling these levers, the traps are going to get activated and kill us all.\"<br/><br/>\"Is there no way for you to delay the traps?\" Kate asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, there is, but I'm already doing that,\" Melindra says. \"The most I can wait between two levers is five minutes. This means that if you're not done helping Barry within the next twenty minutes, we're going to need to get out of here and forget about the puzzle piece altogether.\"<br/><br/>\"Why?\" Kate says. \"Can't we come back later?\"<br/><br/>\"We can, but the puzzle piece dispenser will not be activatable again for at least a month,\" Melindra says. \"In other words, Flower, if you're planning to do something, do it fast.\"<br/><br/> \"Alright,\" Flower says. \"I'm on it. I'm pretty sure that I can already sense Barry's sanctuary. Give me a few moments, and I'll teleport there!\"<br/>No more than five seconds later, I hear Flower speaking again, in a victorious tone.<br/><br/>\"I did it!\" she says, loudly. \"I found it! I found Barry's sanctuary!\"<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Illuna says. \"Now, are you seeing any unusual shades along the borders of the cube, or maybe towards the corners?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... yes!\" Flower says. \"Yes, I think I see it! I'm burning it now!\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" Illuna says. \"Let us know when you're done, so that Barry can open his eyes again.\"<br/><br/>\"Just a second... just a second... Okay, I'm done!\" Flower says. \"It's gone! The shade is gone!\"<br/><br/>",

I can move my consciousness between the two planes at will.

And... I think I can also make it so that I don't shift involuntarily between planes whenever I'm blinking. Yes... I think... I think I can turn it on and off just by concentrating on it. This is amazing!

Maybe tens of thousands?\"<br/><br/> \"In that case, it's likely that you may have switched your consciousness between the two planes so many times that you've learned how to do it instinctively,\" Illuna says. \"Enjoy your new-found ability.\"<br/>\"So... does this mean that I am an ethereal now?...\" I ask her, confused.<br/><br/>\"Being able to change your consciousness between planes is not something unique to ethereals,\" Illuna says. \"I can do it, Arraka can do it, and the same goes for any spirit from the magical plane, but just because we can change our perspective does not mean that our main focus is on the ethereal plane. In Flower's case, she considers her real self to be the soul from her mind, and she views her body from the earthen plane as a puppet on strings. Is this how you are feeling about your body right now?\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" I say. \"Now that you mention it, no, that is not how I'm feeling. I did feel sort of like that when the Overseer was the one who sent my consciousness to the ethereal plane by force, but not anymore. My body from the earthen plane is clearly my main perspective, and the soul feels like the one that I'm controlling through strings, instead.\"<br/><br/>\"Then you are not an ethereal,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I guess not,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"This is all very lovely,\" Melindra says, \"but could we perhaps focus on our original task? I can't delay these traps for much longer, so I suggest you either get the puzzle piece now, or we get the hell out of here!\"<br/><br/>",
