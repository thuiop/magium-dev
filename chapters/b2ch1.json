Are you ready?\"<br/><br/>Golmyck makes a short pause before he continues.<br/><br/>\"Very well, then!\" he says. \"Your first objectives are as follows. You will need to each find a glowing pinecone and bring it to the city of Galamir. Glowing pinecones grow only on the continent of Varathia, so most of you may not know much about them, but they basically look just like regular pinecones, except they start glowing brightly when you take them in your hand. There is no time limit for completing these objectives, but the earlier you bring the pinecones to their destination, the quicker you can begin your next objectives, which will give you a head start, compared to the latecomers. Lastly, I would like to mention that in this round you will be allowed to form teams with other participants. A team can have as many members as you want, and if you all confirm that you are part of the same team when you reach Galamir, you will pass the first round together, as long as you have at least one pinecone with you. That would be all for now. Good luck!\"<br/><br/>\"What?!\" Hadrik shouts. \"He can't be serious! How can they even call this a mage tournament with objectives like that? What's next, are they going to tell us to go pick some flowers?\"<br/><br/>",

The very fact that this revenant came to be is proof that Rose was already dead when the servant of Ulruk took hold of her body.\" <br/><br/>\"But...\" Kate tries to argue again, this time with a lot more hesitation in her voice. \"But... maybe if we...\"<br/><br/>She stops when she realizes that she no longer has any valid arguments to bring to the table. Instead of continuing her train of thought, her gaze turns towards the ground again, and she doesn't say another word.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry,\" Daren says, as he turns back and he starts to walk towards Rose's house again.<br/><br/>We all follow him one by one, with Kate being the last to move from her spot. The rest of our journey towards the mansion was spent in complete silence.<br/><br/>",

Over there we have Kate, and the little girl's name is Flower. Oh, and we also have two banshees. The one inside the girl's body is named Illuna, and the one in the amulet I'm holding is named Arraka.\"<br/><br/> There is a barely audible mumbling sound coming from the closed amulet, as Hadrik stops talking, but nobody pays it any mind.<br/>\"Two banshees?\" Enrique asks, a bit shocked. \"And Rose was friends with both of them?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, not both of them,\" Hadrik says. \"The one in the amulet is more our prisoner than our ally, really, but Illuna and Rose were definitely very good friends.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, in that case she will always be welcome here, banshee or no,\" Enrique says. \"Ah, here comes our wine!\"<br/><br/>",

If you will have me, I promise that I will serve you as faithfully as I've served her.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm going to stop you right there, Ella,\" Enrique says, as he gently lifts the girl's chin with his hand, so she can look directly in his eyes. \"You should not be telling such lies. The Rose I knew would never have hired a slave to work for her. No matter what your past may have been, once you became a part of this family, you did so as a free woman, and not as a slave. As long as you work in this house, you are prohibited to call yourself a slave any longer.

May she always be remembered, and may she continue to live in our hearts, from now and forever more!\"<br/><br/>After hearing Enrique's speech, we all decided to take our wine glasses, and to join in on the toast. <br/><br/>The next half of an hour was spent talking about Rose. We told Enrique of the adventures we've had with her for the past week, and he told us of their years together at the mansion. It was clear that none of us were in the mood for drinking, or telling stories, but it didn't matter. <br/><br/> Enrique was right. Rose would not have wanted us to spend our lives in regret. And we couldn't afford to avoid talking about her from now on just because it hurt to remember her. Rose did not deserve this.<br/>While we talked, it was becoming more and more obvious that despite his cheerful act, Enrique was likely the one who was suffering the most from Rose's loss. However, whenever he talked about Rose, his smile would become genuine, and even Kate had managed to smile once or twice during our long conversation.<br/><br/>When time began to run out, we told Enrique that we needed to be heading towards the castle, and we each went to get our backpacks before starting on our new journey. As we were about to set out, Enrique took us aside for a moment to have a word with us, away from the kids.<br/><br/>\"There is something that I did not dare to ask in front of the children,\" Enrique says. \"I saw that you did not bring Rose's body with you when you returned to the mansion, so I assumed the worst, but I need to know.

We left Rose to talk with her little brother and sister, while we each went to our own rooms to get our backpacks. When we got back to the yard, we noticed that there was now also another person standing next to Rose, besides her two siblings. <br/>As we got closer, we could see that this person was a man as tall as Daren, with a well-toned muscular build, wearing a shirt that was half unbuttoned, with long black hair that reached his shoulders, and a bristly moustache covering his whole upper lip. On his left hip, he was wearing a golden scabbard that appeared to be holding a rather expensive sword, at least judging by the multitude of gems decorating its hilt. The man seemed to be in the middle of a discussion with Rose, but when he saw us approach, he gave us all one long look before he started speaking again.<br/><br/>\"Ah, I see you have befriended a few of the tournament's participants on your latest journey,\" the man tells Rose. \"Could you please introduce me to your new friends?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course!\" Rose says, and then she turns to us. \"This is my ex-husband, Enrique. He was just telling me what Suzie and Kevin had been up to for these past few weeks, since he's been checking up on them every now and then while I've been away.\"<br/><br/>Rose now turns to Enrique, as she introduces us to him, one by one.<br/><br/> \"Enrique,\" she says, \"these are my friends who have helped me get back home safely, and who have saved my life countless times in the past week. From right to left, we have Flower, Illuna, Kate, Barry, Daren and Hadrik.\"<br/>\"Wait, why did you tell me two names while you were pointing towards the little girl?\" Enrique asks.<br/><br/>\"Oh, uh, it's a little complicated,\" Rose says. \"You see, Flower is the girl's name, and Illuna is a banshee that lives within her. They are both sharing the same body, but they are very good friends.\"<br/><br/>\"A girl and a banshee, living peacefully in the same body?\" Enrique says, surprised. \"Now, that's something you don't see every day!\"<br/><br/>He then goes to Daren and shakes his hand.<br/><br/>\"You must be Rose's new lover!\" Enrique tells Daren. \"Take good care of her, my friend.

We wouldn't want to keep the king of Thilias waiting.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, right, the message from earlier!\" Enrique says. \"You mean that Golmyck was talking about your friends, when he made the invitation at the end?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, exactly!\" Rose says. \"I'll need to lead them to the castle, so I'll be gone again for a few hours. Would you mind staying here with the children until I get back?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course not!\" Enrique says. \"That is the reason I came here, after all!\"<br/><br/> \"Thank you, Enrique!\" Rose says. \"We'll talk more when I come back. Take care!\"<br/>\"Farewell, my sweet Rose!\" Enrique says. \"And goodbye to you all. I hope we'll meet again someday, so you can tell me about your adventures over a glass of fine wine!\"<br/><br/>We all say our goodbyes to Enrique and to Rose's siblings and then we begin our new journey, towards the castle of Thilias. Rose takes the lead, just like before, but this time she makes sure to show us all of the signposts and buildings she uses as landmarks, because later, we would need to find our way back to her mansion on our own.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry about earlier,\" Rose tells Daren, as we walk through the alleyways. \"I hope Enrique didn't make you feel too uncomfortable. It's just that he's been worrying about me for a while because I haven't been with another man since we broke up, and he always gets carried away in situations like this.\"<br/><br/>\"It's okay,\" Daren says. \"Frankly, I'm more worried about that guy who got asked the same question when he came here with his wife. Did you eventually manage to clear the misunderstanding?\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, well, I tried my best to explain the situation to his wife, but I'm not sure how much she believed me,\" Rose says. \"I know that the two of them are still together, but they haven't really talked to me since that day...\"<br/><br/>\"I don't blame her,\" Daren says. \"I think even my wife would have been wary around you after hearing something like that.\"<br/><br/>",

The castle's windows looked as if they were supposed to have precious gems encrusted on their frames, but the gems were all missing. It also seemed as if several decorations had been ripped off from the towers. <br/>The castle's interior looks even worse. The hallways are completely empty. There are no paintings on the walls, no carpets on the ground and no vases on the tables. The place looks more like a dungeon than a castle. There aren't even any guards patrolling the hallways. I'm almost starting to wonder if we didn't somehow end up in the wrong place.<br/><br/>\"This feels like the ogre fort, all over again,\" Hadrik says, as he opens Arraka's amulet. \"Hey, you! Arraka! Are you sensing any guards hiding invisibly around here? Answer me!\"<br/><br/>Arraka makes no sound, acting as if she weren't hearing a word of what Hadrik is saying.<br/><br/>\"Giving me the silent treatment, eh?\" Hadrik says, with a grin.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Kate freezes the whole area around us, making it look as if we were inside some frozen palace from a fairy tale.<br/><br/>\"The area is clear,\" Kate says. \"There's no one surrounding us.\"<br/><br/>\"Great,\" Daren says. \"Now unfreeze the damn hallway before anyone sees--\"<br/><br/> Before Daren got to finish his sentence, a door in front of us opened slightly, and a man that appeared to be some kind of a servant from the castle stuck his head out of it.<br/>\"The king will--\" the man starts to say, but he suddenly stops talking, due to the shock of seeing the whole hallway completely frozen. <br/><br/>After a few seconds, the man starts talking again, choosing to act as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>\"The king will be notified of your arrival, shortly,\" the servant says. \"Please wait in this hallway until it is time for your scheduled appointment.\"<br/><br/>He then closes the door without saying another word.<br/><br/>\"Well, you heard the man!\" Flower says. \"We still have plenty of time left until the meeting. Let's go exploring!\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Daren says. \"He told us to wait here.

The flames then disappear as quickly as they appeared, leaving the hallway in the same state it was when we first came in.<br/><br/>\"There,\" Flower says. \"I took care of it.

I go catch up to Flower, who seems to have stopped in front of a wall, not far from our original position. After looking at the wall from different angles, the girl starts to knock on the bricks, one by one, as if she were looking for something.<br/><br/>\"Is there anything special about this wall?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Shush, I'm trying to listen!\" Flower says, as she continues to knock on the bricks.<br/><br/>After a few more seconds, the girl finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she starts to pull one of the bricks out of the wall with both her hands. As she puts the brick down, I see that inside the hole left in the wall, there is a small wooden lever.<br/><br/>\"Wow, you sure know your stuff, huh?\" I tell Flower.<br/><br/>\"Of course!\" Flower says. \"Petal and I have been through dozens of ruins with hidden passages before!

We both go beyond the wall, and enter a small dark room that has a stone pedestal in the middle of it. Upon closer examination, it seems that there is some writing on the top of the pedestal, but it is too dark to make out what it says.<br/><br/>Flower makes a small orb of fire, which she sends floating above the pedestal, so I can read the writing on it. Now that I get a clear look at it, it appears that the text is written in the Common language.<br/><br/>\"What does it say?\" Flower asks.<br/><br/>\"It says: 'Place your palm on this pedestal, if you like discovering secrets.' \"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I love discovering secrets!\" Flower says, and she quickly places her palm on top of the stone pedestal.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch1_puzzle2 || 0) == 0) {%> \"No, I'd rather stay here.\"<br/>\"Suit yourself!\" Flower says. \"Well, if anyone wants to come, just follow me.

I'm not even in the tournament.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, that's true, I guess...\" Daren says, as Flower stops in front of a wall, and she starts examining it closely.<br/><br/>After a few seconds, the girl begins to knock on each of the bricks in front of her, one by one. <br/><br/>\"What do you think she's doing?\" Daren asks me.<br/><br/>\"She's probably looking for a secret passage, or something,\" I say.<br/><br/>Shortly after I stop talking, the girl takes out a brick from the wall, and then she puts her hand in the hole left by the missing brick. The bricks in front of her then suddenly start to get pushed inside the wall, making way for her to pass on the other side.<br/><br/>\"Wow, she sure knows her stuff, huh?\" I say, as the girl disappears behind the wall.<br/><br/>\"Well, we did first meet her while she was doing morning exercises in some trap filled ruins,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Before opening the last set of doors, Daren looks at each of us in turn, to confirm that we are ready, and then we all step inside the throne room, one by one.<br/>The throne room looks just as empty as every other part of the castle, except there is a long, narrow, red carpet leading to the throne on the opposite side of the chamber, where the king is currently sitting. Standing beside him we can see the servant from before, and on the other side, an old man that I do not recognize, but who appears to be rather important, at least judging by his expensive clothing. The gnome is now dressed in a more kingly manner than when he made his last appearance, having a golden crown on his head and a red mantle on his shoulders. When we arrive in front of him, he greets us courteously.<br/><br/>\"Welcome, friends!\" Golmyck says. \"Please, make yourselves at home! I'm sorry for the lack of chairs, but I've been told repeatedly that it would not be fitting for ordinary people to be seated in the presence of a king.\"<br/><br/>\"Skip the formalities, king of Thilias,\" the important-looking man says. \"This isn't the time and place to observe proper etiquette.\"<br/><br/>\"Now, now, ambassador,\" Golmyck says. \"Proper etiquette is always important, lest we descend into barbarism.\"<br/><br/> \"You speak to me of barbarism, when the people standing before us are proven murderers?\" the ambassador says. \"I did not come here to hear your lectures. I came here in the name of the king of Ollendor, in order to make sure that the murderers of his majesty's brother are rightfully punished!\"<br/>\"Murderers they may be,\" Golmyck says, \"but they are also our esteemed guests, and I would like to at least hear their reasons, before deciding their punishment.\"<br/><br/>He then turns to us.<br/><br/>\"What say you, brave warriors?\" the gnome says. \"What was your reason for killing the earl of Ollendor?\"<br/><br/>",

In fact, if I recall correctly, that is how I named this place after the still winter. The island of Varathia. The island of freedom. Why did people start calling this a continent, I wonder?

Was it perhaps to satisfy your own egos, fooling yourselves into believing that you could compare with the civilizations from the other continents?\" <br/><br/>\"Creator, please,\" the ambassador says. \"I don't know what your affiliation is with these mages, but they have done us a great harm.

You will be permitted to participate in this tournament, as long as you do not shapeshift yourself into anything bigger than what would normally be possible for a dwarf.

While these documents will most likely not be needed in Thilias, they should help you deal with guards that might try to have you arrested in other cities, for the murder of the earl of Ollendor. Now, unless you have anything else to discuss with me, I will start writing on that letter of admission for the dwarf, and then you can be on your way.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Just as we turn to leave, the gnome suddenly remembers that he forgot to tell us something.<br/>\"Oh, and one last thing,\" Golmyck says. \"I believe this should go without saying, but I will mention it, nonetheless. You should never talk about anything we've discussed in this room as long as you are inside the city. Not even amongst yourselves. You never know when someone might be listening. I called you into this secure room to chat privately because I felt I could trust you with this information. I hope that you will not betray my trust.\"<br/><br/>\"Of course not...\" Daren says. \"We will take care.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well, then,\" Golmyck says. \"In that case, I wish you luck in the arena, and may the gods be with you!\"<br/><br/>\"May they watch over us all,\" Daren says.<br/><br/> After we finished our discussion with Golmyck, we said our goodbyes to the gnome, and we left him to work on his devices, while we started to climb up the narrow stairs, one by one. When we reached the throne room, the king's servant was already waiting for us, at the top of the stairs.<br/>\"This way, if you please,\" the servant says, as he starts walking towards the exit. \"Make sure that you follow me closely, so you won't get lost.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, Barry, we're right behind you!\" Hadrik says, and then he grins at me widely. \"Isn't that right, Barry?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, shut up,\" I tell him, as we all start to follow the servant out of the room, and towards our new prison. <br/><br/>",
