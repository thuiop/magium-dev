Are you ready?\"<br/><br/>Golmyck makes a short pause before he continues.<br/><br/>\"Very well, then!\" he says. \"Your first objectives are as follows. You will need to each find a glowing pinecone and bring it to the city of Galamir. Glowing pinecones grow only on the continent of Varathia, so most of you may not know much about them, but they basically look just like regular pinecones, except they start glowing brightly when you take them in your hand. There is no time limit for completing these objectives, but the earlier you bring the pinecones to their destination, the quicker you can begin your next objectives, which will give you a head start, compared to the latecomers. Lastly, I would like to mention that in this round you will be allowed to form teams with other participants. A team can have as many members as you want, and if you all confirm that you are part of the same team when you reach Galamir, you will pass the first round together, as long as you have at least one pinecone with you. That would be all for now. Good luck!\"<br/><br/>\"What?!\" Hadrik shouts. \"He can't be serious! How can they even call this a mage tournament with objectives like that? What's next, are they going to tell us to go pick some flowers?\"<br/><br/>",

May she always be remembered, and may she continue to live in our hearts, from now and forever more!\"<br/><br/>After hearing Enrique's speech, we all decided to take our wine glasses, and to join in on the toast. <br/><br/>The next half of an hour was spent talking about Rose. We told Enrique of the adventures we've had with her for the past week, and he told us of their years together at the mansion. It was clear that none of us were in the mood for drinking, or telling stories, but it didn't matter. <br/><br/> Enrique was right. Rose would not have wanted us to spend our lives in regret. And we couldn't afford to avoid talking about her from now on just because it hurt to remember her. Rose did not deserve this.<br/>While we talked, it was becoming more and more obvious that despite his cheerful act, Enrique was likely the one who was suffering the most from Rose's loss. However, whenever he talked about Rose, his smile would become genuine, and even Kate had managed to smile once or twice during our long conversation.<br/><br/>When time began to run out, we told Enrique that we needed to be heading towards the castle, and we each went to get our backpacks before starting on our new journey. As we were about to set out, Enrique took us aside for a moment to have a word with us, away from the kids.<br/><br/>\"There is something that I did not dare to ask in front of the children,\" Enrique says. \"I saw that you did not bring Rose's body with you when you returned to the mansion, so I assumed the worst, but I need to know.

We left Rose to talk with her little brother and sister, while we each went to our own rooms to get our backpacks. When we got back to the yard, we noticed that there was now also another person standing next to Rose, besides her two siblings. <br/>As we got closer, we could see that this person was a man as tall as Daren, with a well-toned muscular build, wearing a shirt that was half unbuttoned, with long black hair that reached his shoulders, and a bristly moustache covering his whole upper lip. On his left hip, he was wearing a golden scabbard that appeared to be holding a rather expensive sword, at least judging by the multitude of gems decorating its hilt. The man seemed to be in the middle of a discussion with Rose, but when he saw us approach, he gave us all one long look before he started speaking again.<br/><br/>\"Ah, I see you have befriended a few of the tournament's participants on your latest journey,\" the man tells Rose. \"Could you please introduce me to your new friends?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course!\" Rose says, and then she turns to us. \"This is my ex-husband, Enrique. He was just telling me what Suzie and Kevin had been up to for these past few weeks, since he's been checking up on them every now and then while I've been away.\"<br/><br/>Rose now turns to Enrique, as she introduces us to him, one by one.<br/><br/> \"Enrique,\" she says, \"these are my friends who have helped me get back home safely, and who have saved my life countless times in the past week. From right to left, we have Flower, Illuna, Kate, Barry, Daren and Hadrik.\"<br/>\"Wait, why did you tell me two names while you were pointing towards the little girl?\" Enrique asks.<br/><br/>\"Oh, uh, it's a little complicated,\" Rose says. \"You see, Flower is the girl's name, and Illuna is a banshee that lives within her. They are both sharing the same body, but they are very good friends.\"<br/><br/>\"A girl and a banshee, living peacefully in the same body?\" Enrique says, surprised. \"Now, that's something you don't see every day!\"<br/><br/>He then goes to Daren and shakes his hand.<br/><br/>\"You must be Rose's new lover!\" Enrique tells Daren. \"Take good care of her, my friend. She is an extraordinary woman!\"<br/><br/>",

Follow me, we need to go into this alley, next!\"<br/><br/>",

Given that we arrived at our destination with plenty of time to spare, we took our time in saying our goodbyes to Rose.<br/>\"Okay, okay,\" Rose says, after Kate is done hugging her. \"Enough with the goodbyes! You're only going to a meeting. It's not like we'll never see each other again!\"<br/><br/>\"Remember to keep that transceiver I gave you close to you at all times,\" Daren tells Rose. \"If things get ugly, and we are unable to come back, we'll give you a call.\"<br/><br/>\"There goes Daren again, with his usual optimism!\" Rose says, smiling. \"I'm sure you'll be fine. The king just wants to have a talk with you, that's all. Otherwise he would have sent an arrest warrant, not an invitation.\"<br/><br/>\"Let's hope you are right,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Well, the entrance is that way,\" Rose says. \"I think we've spent enough time standing around in front of the castle. Remember... While you're away, I'm planning to cook a meal that will put Flower's magic to shame, so don't be late!\"<br/><br/>\"Wouldn't miss it for the world!\" I say.<br/><br/>Rose smiles, and she turns away, while we do the same, and start heading towards the big gate in front of us. As we approach the entrance, Daren signals the guards to let us through, and once they confirm our identities, they open the doors. We all step inside, slowly, as the gates slam shut behind us.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " There's something odd about this castle. I noticed it even before we went inside. The castle's windows looked as if they were supposed to have precious gems encrusted on their frames, but the gems were all missing. It also seemed as if several decorations had been ripped off from the towers. <br/>The castle's interior looks even worse. The hallways are completely empty. There are no paintings on the walls, no carpets on the ground and no vases on the tables. The place looks more like a dungeon than a castle. There aren't even any guards patrolling the hallways. I'm almost starting to wonder if we didn't somehow end up in the wrong place.<br/><br/>\"This feels like the ogre fort, all over again,\" Hadrik says, as he opens Arraka's amulet. \"Hey, you! Arraka! Are you sensing any guards hiding invisibly around here? Answer me!\"<br/><br/>Arraka makes no sound, acting as if she weren't hearing a word of what Hadrik is saying.<br/><br/>\"Giving me the silent treatment, eh?\" Hadrik says, with a grin.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Kate freezes the whole area around us, making it look as if we were inside some frozen palace from a fairy tale.<br/><br/>\"The area is clear,\" Kate says. \"There's no one surrounding us.\"<br/><br/>\"Great,\" Daren says. \"Now unfreeze the damn hallway before anyone sees--\"<br/><br/> Before Daren got to finish his sentence, a door in front of us opened slightly, and a man that appeared to be some kind of a servant from the castle stuck his head out of it.<br/>\"The king will--\" the man starts to say, but he suddenly stops talking, due to the shock of seeing the whole hallway completely frozen. <br/><br/>After a few seconds, the man starts talking again, choosing to act as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>\"The king will be notified of your arrival, shortly,\" the servant says. \"Please wait in this hallway until it is time for your scheduled appointment.\"<br/><br/>He then closes the door without saying another word.<br/><br/>\"Well, you heard the man!\" Flower says. \"We still have plenty of time left until the meeting. Let's go exploring!\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Daren says. \"He told us to wait here. And Kate still needs to unfreeze the hallway, before anyone else sees this!\"<br/><br/>\"I can't unfreeze it,\" Kate says. \"It will melt on its own in a few hours.\"<br/><br/>\"We don't have a few hours!\" Daren says. \"If the king sees this, he'll have our heads!\"<br/><br/>\"Relax!\" Hadrik says. \"What's the worst that could happen?\"<br/><br/> \"Good gods, man!\" Daren says, exasperated. \"Isn't there anything that ever sets you off?\"<br/>All of a sudden, the whole area around us gets covered in flames, and all of the ice quickly melts into water, which then almost immediately evaporates into thin air. The flames then disappear as quickly as they appeared, leaving the hallway in the same state it was when we first came in.<br/><br/>\"There,\" Flower says. \"I took care of it. Now, does anyone want to go exploring?\"<br/><br/>",

I go catch up to Flower, who seems to have stopped in front of a wall, not far from our original position. After looking at the wall from different angles, the girl starts to knock on the bricks, one by one, as if she were looking for something.<br/><br/>\"Is there anything special about this wall?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Shush, I'm trying to listen!\" Flower says, as she continues to knock on the bricks.<br/><br/>After a few more seconds, the girl finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she starts to pull one of the bricks out of the wall with both her hands. As she puts the brick down, I see that inside the hole left in the wall, there is a small wooden lever.<br/><br/>\"Wow, you sure know your stuff, huh?\" I tell Flower.<br/><br/>\"Of course!\" Flower says. \"Petal and I have been through dozens of ruins with hidden passages before!

We both go beyond the wall, and enter a small dark room that has a stone pedestal in the middle of it. Upon closer examination, it seems that there is some writing on the top of the pedestal, but it is too dark to make out what it says.<br/><br/>Flower makes a small orb of fire, which she sends floating above the pedestal, so I can read the writing on it. Now that I get a clear look at it, it appears that the text is written in the Common language.<br/><br/>\"What does it say?\" Flower asks.<br/><br/>\"It says: 'Place your palm on this pedestal, if you like discovering secrets.' \"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I love discovering secrets!\" Flower says, and she quickly places her palm on top of the stone pedestal.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch1_puzzle2 || 0) == 0) {%> \"No, I'd rather stay here.\"<br/>\"Suit yourself!\" Flower says. \"Well, if anyone wants to come, just follow me.

I'm not even in the tournament.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, that's true, I guess...\" Daren says, as Flower stops in front of a wall, and she starts examining it closely.<br/><br/>After a few seconds, the girl begins to knock on each of the bricks in front of her, one by one. <br/><br/>\"What do you think she's doing?\" Daren asks me.<br/><br/>\"She's probably looking for a secret passage, or something,\" I say.<br/><br/>Shortly after I stop talking, the girl takes out a brick from the wall, and then she puts her hand in the hole left by the missing brick. The bricks in front of her then suddenly start to get pushed inside the wall, making way for her to pass on the other side.<br/><br/>\"Wow, she sure knows her stuff, huh?\" I say, as the girl disappears behind the wall.<br/><br/>\"Well, we did first meet her while she was doing morning exercises in some trap filled ruins,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Before opening the last set of doors, Daren looks at each of us in turn, to confirm that we are ready, and then we all step inside the throne room, one by one.<br/>The throne room looks just as empty as every other part of the castle, except there is a long, narrow, red carpet leading to the throne on the opposite side of the chamber, where the king is currently sitting. Standing beside him we can see the servant from before, and on the other side, an old man that I do not recognize, but who appears to be rather important, at least judging by his expensive clothing. The gnome is now dressed in a more kingly manner than when he made his last appearance, having a golden crown on his head and a red mantle on his shoulders. When we arrive in front of him, he greets us courteously.<br/><br/>\"Welcome, friends!\" Golmyck says. \"Please, make yourselves at home! I'm sorry for the lack of chairs, but I've been told repeatedly that it would not be fitting for ordinary people to be seated in the presence of a king.\"<br/><br/>\"Skip the formalities, king of Thilias,\" the important-looking man says. \"This isn't the time and place to observe proper etiquette.\"<br/><br/>\"Now, now, ambassador,\" Golmyck says. \"Proper etiquette is always important, lest we descend into barbarism.\"<br/><br/> \"You speak to me of barbarism, when the people standing before us are proven murderers?\" the ambassador says. \"I did not come here to hear your lectures. I came here in the name of the king of Ollendor, in order to make sure that the murderers of his majesty's brother are rightfully punished!\"<br/>\"Murderers they may be,\" Golmyck says, \"but they are also our esteemed guests, and I would like to at least hear their reasons, before deciding their punishment.\"<br/><br/>He then turns to us.<br/><br/>\"What say you, brave warriors?\" the gnome says. \"What was your reason for killing the earl of Ollendor?\"<br/><br/>",

Is that the Creator we're talking about, here?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm surprised that you didn't know this by now,\" Eiden says, with a puzzled expression on his face. \"Didn't Arraka tell you? She was there when it all began, after all.\"<br/><br/>There are a few moments of silence, during which we all turn our gaze towards Arraka's amulet.<br/><br/>\"What, didn't I mention it?\" Arraka says. \"I guess it must have slipped my mind. Aha- AHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br/><br/>\"So, you are the Creator that I've been hearing so much about,\" Golmyck says, while stroking his chin. <br/><br/>\"I am indeed!\" Eiden says. \"And I must say that I am a big fan of your work. I heard that the first thing you did when you moved into the royal castle was to strip it of anything of value, sell everything, and then give the money to the poor. The nobility in all of Varathia had been in an uproar for months after the event. It was a most entertaining spectacle to see!\"<br/><br/> \"I was always of the opinion that the royal castle belongs not to the royal family, but to the people,\" Golmyck says. \"I only did what anyone else would have done in my place, if they had been chosen by the people to represent their interests.\"<br/>\"I think you might be holding too high of an opinion of the people under your rule, king of Thilias,\" Eiden says, with a polite smile.<br/><br/>\"Creator,\" the ambassador says, as he finally musters up the courage to speak again. \"I know that your word is law throughout the whole continent of Varathia, but I must insist--\"<br/><br/>\"The continent of Varathia...\" Eiden interrupts him. \"You people always called it that, didn't you? But the size of Varathia is nowhere near the size of any other continent in the world. If anything, it's more of an island, really. In fact, if I recall correctly, that is how I named this place after the still winter. The island of Varathia. The island of freedom. Why did people start calling this a continent, I wonder? Was it because you felt left out, when you discovered that there was a world outside of Varathia? Was it perhaps to satisfy your own egos, fooling yourselves into believing that you could compare with the civilizations from the other continents?\" <br/><br/>\"Creator, please,\" the ambassador says. \"I don't know what your affiliation is with these mages, but they have done us a great harm. A life has been lost that can never be replaced. It would be most tragic if the victim's killers were to be simply set free.\"<br/><br/>",

I haven't really been tinkering with devices as often as I would have liked since I became king, but I find that this place always relaxes me after a heated discussion such as the one that I had with the ambassador earlier.\"<br/>\"You said that you had something you wanted to discuss with us in private?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I did,\" Golmyck says. \"Let's start with your giant friend over there, who is currently shapeshifting into a dwarf.\"<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Hadrik says. \"I should have known that it was all too good to be true. Is this the part where you kick me out of the tournament?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course not!\" Golmyck says. \"The rules of the tournament never explicitly stated that giants were not allowed in the tournament. We only avoided inviting giants to this contest because of the overwhelming advantage you would get from both your size and your strength. However, given that you have willingly shrunk yourself to the size of a dwarf, we have decided to make an exception in your case. You will be permitted to participate in this tournament, as long as you do not shapeshift yourself into anything bigger than what would normally be possible for a dwarf. And also, since you seem to be so fond of your dwarf form, this is how you will present yourself to all other participants from now on. I don't want any of the other mages finding out that you are in fact a giant. Are we clear?\"<br/><br/> \"As clear as can be!\" Hadrik says, grinning happily. <br/>\"Well, in that case, you are free to go!\" Golmyck says. \"I no longer have any business to discuss with you.\"<br/><br/>\"You mean I'm free to go to the arena, or...\"<br/><br/>\"No, I mean that you are free to carry on with the first round of the tournament,\" Golmyck says. \"Unlike your friends, you were not present at the scene of the crime, so there is no reason for us to incarcerate you. There is no need for you to go into the arena.\"<br/><br/>\"The hell there isn't!\" Hadrik shouts. \"Do you think I came all the way here to go looking for pinecones? I came here to fight, damn it! I swear, if you don't let me fight in this arena, I'm going to start thrashing the whole neighborhood until your guards throw me in there themselves!\"<br/><br/>",

I imagine that the scene you witnessed that day must have been quite shocking for outsiders like yourselves.\"<br/>\"You don't sound like you approve of what was happening with the slave girl,\" Kate says. <br/><br/>\"I do not,\" Golmyck says. \"I personally find that the way our society treats slaves is sickening, and that we are all responsible in a way for allowing this system to continue. I, myself, am not much better than my predecessors, because I've barely done anything conclusive to address the problem since I moved into this castle.\"<br/><br/>\"But why?\" Daren asks. \"Why haven't you done anything?

Make no mistake, I am not the only person with an information network in this city. And the control I have over my kingdom is in fact a lot more limited than you might think.\"<br/><br/>\"And who are these people that are keeping tabs on you, exactly?\" Hadrik asks. \"The other kings?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, in a way,\" Golmyck says. \"The ones in charge of keeping an eye on me are a group of lessathi who are allies with the other kings, but who work independently. They control a vast underground network of spies and assassins who rival my own, and their purpose is to make sure that I don't take too many initiatives that might 'endanger' the future of Varathia. If I try to take a decision as bold as freeing all of the slaves in my city, I may well get assassinated even before I manage to sign the decree.\" <br/><br/> \"So, you're just going to stand here and do nothing, then?\" Daren asks.<br/>\"Not at all,\" Golmyck says. \"In fact, I have been working for years to improve our relations with the animal kingdom for this exact purpose. Their territories have been getting smaller and smaller due to the increasing number of monster attacks in recent years, so their negotiators have become a little less rigid lately. I promised to provide them shelter within our walls, on the condition that they help us clear the lessathi threat from our city. I will have a meeting in this very room with one of the representatives of the animal kingdom in a few days, where we will discuss this exact topic. If everything goes well, it is very likely that we will be reaching an agreement in the next few months.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what you're trying to say here is that you've got everything under control, and that we should no longer interfere?\" Hadrik asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, exactly,\" Golmyck says. \"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of the whole situation, in case you'd be tempted to do something rash again.\"<br/><br/>",
