The girl dressed in pajamas is looking at us with a victorious smile on her face. She seems very pleased with herself for having managed to finally get our attention. Despite the fact that she is clearly the one who has magically suspended us into the air, her aura is showing no traces of magic whatsoever. Even when Kate and Flower hide their auras, you can still tell that they are mages if you inspect their auras very closely. The girl in front of us, however, seems no different from a regular human. This can mean one of two things. Either she is much better at hiding her aura than Flower and Kate, or...

"Hey, I know you!" Arraka blurts out all of a sudden. "You're that stillwater girl that kept trailing behind Eiden and the fox during the still winter! Uh... what was the name?... Melenda? Milandra?..."

"Melindra," the stillwater girl says, in a cold voice, and then she flicks one of her fingers, casting a wind spell that closes Arraka's amulet.

Arraka mumbles furiously from within her amulet, but nobody is paying any attention to her. Having silenced the banshee, the stillwater girl regains her smile, and she attempts to continue her speech from where she left off.

 "So, as I was saying," Melindra says, "there is something that I would like to ask of you. The reason why I went to watch you in the arena was because I heard that you got convicted for killing a noble from Varathia, so I thought--"
"Hold on a second, there..." Hadrik interrupts her. "You're a stillwater?"

"Why, yes..." Melindra says, confused. "I thought that much would have been obvious by now. Even Arraka said earlier that--"

"But how did you become one?" Hadrik asks. "Did you get born this way? Can women be born as stillwaters?"

 "No, of course not!" Melindra says, slightly irritated. "I didn't get born as a stillwater. I became a stillwater in the same way that everyone else did."
"Everyone?" I ask. "Even Eiden? Is Eiden an artificial mage too? Wasn't he born as a mage?"

"What is an artificial mage?" Melindra says, in a frustrated tone. "Eiden was born as a mage. He just became a stillwater later, just like everyone else. How is this so difficult to understand?"

"But how?" I ask her. "How do you become a stillwater?"

"Listen," Melindra says. "If you think that I'm going to just stand here and answer every single one of your questions before you even listen to what I'm--"

"How do you know Eiden?" Daren asks her. "Are you working with him?"

"No, I'm not working with Eiden!" Melindra says, visibly upset. "If I were working with Eiden, do you think I'd need to come and ask you for help? Why can't you just shut up for ten seconds and let me finish one damn senten--"

 "If you want our help, then how about letting us down first?" Kate asks her. "This is no way to treat someone whom you're trying to ask for a favor."
Melindra is now looking at Kate with a pouting expression on her face that could rival Flower's, when she's upset. After a few seconds of silence, the stillwater girl waves one of her hands, and we all slowly start to descend towards the ground.

It's funny. This girl may well have the power to crush us with a single flick of her fingers, but her demeanor makes her feel like one of the least threatening persons I've met in my life. Perhaps even less threatening than Flower, or the ambassador of Ollendor.

"There!" Melindra says, once her levitation spell gets completely cancelled. "You're all back on the ground. Now, can I continue from where I left off, or are you planning to interrupt me with even more questions?"

 "Actually, I have a few more questions!"
"What?" Melindra says, trying hard to control her temper. "What questions?"

"Well, for starters," I say, "you never told us how you can become a stillwater."

"I don't get it," Melindra says. "Why are you asking me this question? Shouldn't you be asking Eiden this? Aren't you his followers?"

"Hell no!" Daren shouts.

Melindra is looking at us confused.

"His friends, then?" she asks.

"Far from it," Kate says.

 "Then how did you manage to attack that noble?" Melindra says. "Wasn't Eiden the one who gave you the power to do it?"
"It was indeed," Kate says.

"So, why did he do it, if you aren't his friends?" Melindra says.

"You seem to have known Eiden for a while," Kate says. "Do you really think that he needs a logical reason for everything that he does? Or for anything at all, really?"

"Well..." Melindra says. "I mean... not recently... but if you really aren't his friends, I must say I am quite surprised that he left you alive..." 

"Aren't we all?" Kate says.

"So, what was it that you wanted to ask of us?" Daren says.

 "Go on, we're all listening."
"Good!" Melindra says, smiling once again. "Now, as I've said before, if I would've managed to contact Eiden, I wouldn't be bothering you with this, but since he's been completely ignoring me ever since I came back to Varathia, I was thinking that maybe you, as his followers could--"

"What did you just call us?" Daren asks her, perplexed.

"Eiden's followers," Melindra says. "Aren't you his followers?" 

"Hell no!" Daren shouts.

Melindra is looking at us confused.

"His friends, then?" she asks.

 "Oh, right!" Melindra says, as she regains her smile. "In short, I want you to kill someone for me!"
"Woah, woah, woah!" Daren says. "I'm going to stop you right there, Melindra. Despite what you may have heard about us, neither of us are assassins. We won't kill people unless we have very good reasons to do it. We're not going to kill someone just because you asked us to."

"Oh, but I'm not asking you to do it for free!" Melindra says. "I'm more than willing to compensate you for this task!"

"We're not looking for money," Daren says. "We're here to participate in a mage tournament, remember?"

"I know!" Melindra says. "When I was talking about compensation, I meant that I would help you with your objectives. Don't you want to know how to find the pinecones?"

"Why would we need your help for that?" Daren says. "It's just some pinecones. How hard could it be to find them?"

Melindra smirks at Daren, and she takes what appears to be a pinecone seed out of her pocket. She then puts the seed in her hand, and it immediately starts to glow with a bright yellow light, just like Golmyck said it would when he announced our first objectives. She then holds her hand out to Daren, inviting him to take the pinecone seed from her.

 "Go on," Melindra says, with a smile. "Take it! You'll understand why you'll need my help soon enough."
As Daren takes the seed from the stillwater girl's hand, the bright yellow glow fades completely, and the seed does not light back up no matter how much Daren moves it between his palms.

"As you can see," Melindra says, with a victorious smile, "a glowing pinecone's seeds will not light up for just anyone. They only resonate with auras that have an extremely high amount of magical power in them. If we're talking about contestants from the mage tournament, I doubt that anyone other than the four sages would have enough magical power for a pinecone to start glowing in their hands. You'd need pure blind luck to discover a glowing pinecone if you can't even make them glow when you touch them. If you don't believe me, you can pass that pinecone seed between yourselves. I guarantee you that none of you will be able to make it glow."

 We do as she says and we pass the pinecone seed between ourselves, to see if anyone is able to make it light up. Unfortunately, it seems that Melindra was right, and neither of us have anywhere near the required level of magical power to make the seed glow.  
"So," Daren says, as he hands Melindra back her pinecone seed, "am I to understand that what you will be offering us in exchange for the assassination will be one of these glowing pinecones?"

"Oh, no, no, no," Melindra says. "I never managed to get hold of a pinecone. I was lucky enough to find a few seeds on the ground near the border of a sacred forest, while I was on my way here. I wouldn't dare to venture any deeper into one of those forests in order to find an actual pinecone. The golden fox hates my guts!"

"Wait," I say. "Why a sacred forest? Couldn't you just get it from somewhere else?"

"You can't get glowing pinecones from anywhere else," Melindra says. "They only grow in the sacred forests, which are all territories of the golden fox."

 "Oh, no!" Hadrik shouts. "No way! We only just got out of there a few days ago, and now we need to go back? What is wrong with these organizers? It's like they don't want anyone to actually win this damn tournament!"
"So," Kate says, "if you're not going to give us a pinecone, and you aren't volunteering to guide us through the sacred forests either, what is it that you are trying to offer us, exactly?"

"Information!" Melindra says, smiling. "There is a device that has been made specifically to resonate with these pinecones, and it can make them glow without requiring a high amount of magical power, as long as you are close enough to them. It is a very rare device, but I know someone who has it, and I can lead you to them, after you help me with my goal. I can't tell you who this person is, but I am quite certain that I can convince them to lend you the device for a few days, which should be more than enough for you to find a pinecone."

 "Why can't you tell us who this person is? Is it someone we know?"
"I very much doubt that any of you have met this person before," Melindra says. "The reason why I can't divulge their identity is because they've specifically asked me to keep it a secret, if I ever need to mention them in a discussion. I wouldn't read too much into it if I were you. They're just the more secretive type. That's all there is to it."

"Right..." I say.

"So, do we have a deal, then?" Melindra asks us.

"I'm sorry, Melindra," Daren says, "but I can't just go around murdering people to further my own goals. Even if my goal is ultimately to help the entire world, I cannot just kill a man for the simple reason that you want him dead."

"So it is a moral justification that you seek?" Melindra asks, with a look of curiosity in her eyes. "Well what if I tell you, then, that the person I want assassinated is a tyrant that has killed thousands of innocent people, and who is ruling his kingdom through fear and intimidation? Would that help to change your mind?"

"Who are you talking about, exactly?" Kate asks.

"Why, it's the brother of the man that you've only just killed a few days ago!" Melindra says. "The king of Ollendor."

 "You want us to assassinate one of the kings of Varathia?" Hadrik asks, shocked. "Are you out of your mind? We've been put in an arena just for killing a noble, and you now want us to kill a king?"
"Oh, don't worry," Melindra says. "Ollendor never participated in the organization of this tournament. Nobody wants to talk to them. Even Golmyck is less hated by the other kings than the king of Ollendor. I assure you that none of the organizers would bat an eye if you were to raise a ruckus in his kingdom. The only reason why they threatened you with your disqualification from the mage tournament after killing the earl of Ollendor was because you were within the borders of Thilias when you murdered him. If you were to start going on a rampage in Ollendor, I very much doubt that anyone would give a damn. Well, except for the local authorities, of course."

"I'm uh... not sure what to say about this," I say.

"She's telling the truth," Leila writes. "Ollendor is something of a rogue kingdom these days. Neither the lessathi nor the other kings have any influence anymore on what happens within their borders. Everyone pretty much ignores them, and many of the kingdoms have already kicked their ambassadors out of their territories. This is why my father went there, after he escaped from Thilias. Because it's a kingdom where nobody would be able to find him."

"Right..." I say.

"So, do we have a deal, then?" Melindra asks us.

 "See?" Melindra tells us, after she's done reading Leila's text. "There's nothing to worry about!"
"But isn't Ollendor really far away?" Daren says. "And then you also have to lead us to your friend that has the pinecone detector. That sounds like a lot of time wasted, when we're already three days behind every other participant of the tournament."

"So, what?" Melindra says. "It's not like anyone's made any progress since the objectives were announced. Nobody has any idea that the pinecones can only be found in the sacred forests. In fact, they are avoiding the fox's territories like the plague, because they don't want to deal with her, so the chances of them finding even one pinecone in the following week are almost nonexistent. Even when they'll finally figure out what they need to do, they'll still need to go against the golden fox. Without using a detector, I can't even imagine how they'd be able to sneak by unnoticed long enough to be able to test every pinecone by hand, so they will need to engage the fox and her followers directly, and I think you can imagine how that will go for them."

"I'm sorry, but I'm still not buying this," Kate says. "You are a stillwater. Why would you need our help to assassinate a king?"

"Because I came to Varathia as a tournament participant!" Melindra says. "It was the only way I could think of to get back to this place after that blasted king of Ollendor exiled me! But now the tournament's spell is preventing me from hurting any of the locals, so I've been stuck here since day one, trying to find someone who can do the job in my place."

 "And what guarantee do we have that you'll fulfill your promise, once we've completed our task?" Daren asks. "Hell, what guarantee do we even have that you won't start acting like Eiden, and try killing us off for fun, in the middle of our journey? We already know that you've worked with him in the past."
"Oh, for crying out loud!" Melindra shouts, exasperated. "If you're so worried about my motives, then why don't you force me to take an oath? You're an enchanter, aren't you? Just make me swear that I'll fulfill my end of the bargain and that I won't try to hurt you, and we can be done with this."

"An enchanter's oath?" Daren asks her. "Are you serious? You do know that you'll die if you break such an oath, right?"

"Yes, of course I know that!" Melindra says.

"And you would want us to also make an oath that we won't bring harm to you during our journey?" Daren asks.

"Oh, no, you don't need to do that," Melindra says. "It's not like you could do anything against me, anyway."

"Huh..." Daren says.

He then turns towards us.

 "What do you guys think?" Daren asks us. "Leaving aside her mildly infuriating, condescending remark from earlier, I'd say her deal is actually beginning to not sound so bad, all things considered. At the very least, I'm not getting the feeling that she's trying to cheat us, and we'll also get to save a kingdom in the process."
"Well..." Hadrik says. "I can't say that toppling a kingdom is something I've had the opportunity of doing before, and it would also make for a pretty good story when I'm out drinking in taverns... It certainly sounds more fun than looking for pinecones, that's for sure!"

"I'll admit that if we take everything she said into consideration," Kate says, "her way of doing things may actually give us an advantage over the other participants, especially since the contest seems to have been rigged from the very beginning to only allow the four sages to move on to the next round."

"Yeah, what's up with that, anyway?" Hadrik says. "I can't say that I was aiming to win the tournament, but this is still making me pretty pissed. Why did they even invite the other mages, if they weren't planning to give them a fair chance? Was it all just for show?"

 "You are forgetting," Illuna says, "that the condition for passing this round is to bring the pinecones to the city of Galamir. This means that the sages can still be attacked on their way to the city, and the pinecones can be stolen from them. So, if you are strong or resourceful enough to be able to take an item from a sage, you can still pass to the next round, even if you don't have sufficient power to make the pinecone glow. Plus, you also have the option to join the team of one of the sages, if they accept you. In other words, there's more than one way to pass this round, but they all require dealing with the sages somehow. If you want to avoid the sages, then the pinecone detector will likely be your best option."
"Well, I don't know about you guys," I say, "but I'm personally looking forward to causing a little mayhem in the homelands of the ambassador of Ollendor. It would feel pretty good to finally get some payback after all he's put us through in the arena. And besides, Ollendor is practically going to become Leila's new home, soon, so we may as well do some cleaning up before she moves in."

Leila looks a little taken aback by my last comment. I think this is the first time when she actually realizes that she won't need to part ways with us, now that the arena is over.

"You will be coming with us to Ollendor, right?" I ask her.

"Yes!" Leila writes, smiling happily. "Yes, of course!"

 "Well, if everyone's on board with this," Daren says, "then we'll get started with the enchanter's oath right away. Does anyone have any suggestions for things that we should not forget to include in this oath? So far, Melindra has agreed to vow that she won't cause any harm to us, and that she won't back out of the deal after we've fulfilled our end of the bargain, but maybe there's something else we need to add, to make sure that the deal is made in good faith?"

 "The deal should not be considered over until the device is actually in our hands."
"Well, yeah, obviously," Daren says. "If she expects us to practically fight an entire kingdom all by ourselves, then I'll be damned if I'll do it over a vague promise of her 'leading' us to someone who has what we need."

"Sounds fair," Melindra says.

Once Daren makes sure that nobody else has any suggestions, he takes out his sword, and he lightly cuts one of the fingers from Melindra's left hand with it. Melindra then sprinkles some of the blood dripping from her finger on top of the sword, and the weapon begins to shine brightly, with a white light.

"Is it working?" Melindra says. "Can I say the oath?"

"Yes, the spell is working," Daren says. "You may begin."

"Okay," Melindra says. "So, first of all, I swear that I'm not going to harm any of you."

"You... do know how this works, right?..." Daren tells her. "If you don't specify a duration, the oath becomes life-binding. If I accept your vow like this, you won't be able to harm us for the rest of your life!"

"Listen," Melindra says, while pointing her finger at Daren. "If we're all just going to keep doubting each other, we won't get anywhere. Just accept the vow, will you?"

 "Well... okay, I guess..." Daren says, as he puts one of his hands over the sword, and the white light begins to flicker.
"Wait, wait, hold on!" Melindra says.

"Seriously?" Daren says. "I barely managed to cancel the vow in time. What is it?"

"Can I change the word 'harm' to 'inflict serious injuries'?" Melindra says. "I wouldn't want to get killed for patting someone on the back."

"This is an enchanter's oath!" Daren says. "When you say harm, it's going to actually mean harm. Patting someone on the back or smacking them over the head is out of the question. And besides, you'll get ample warning if the spell considers that you are crossing the line. You won't be able to trigger it accidentally."

"Oh," Melindra says. "Well, in that case, carry on."

As soon as Daren is done confirming the first vow, he urges Melindra to continue with her second vow.

"Okay, uh..." Melindra says. "I swear that as soon as you kill the king of Ollendor, I will begin leading you towards the person who has the pinecone detector that I told you about earlier, and I will not take any breaks unless you specifically ask me to. I also swear that as soon as I'm done leading you to this person, I will not rest until the device is safely in your hands."

"Good thinking!" Daren says. "The fact that she won't hurt us herself is meaningless if she's just planning to lead us into a trap."

"Uh..." Melindra says. "I'm not sure how much I can vouch for my 'friend', but what I could do is to guarantee that I won't let them bring any harm to you, and we could also make it so that our deal will not be considered done until I leave you somewhere safe, with the device in your arms."

"Sounds good," Daren says.

 Daren moves his hand over the sword again, confirming Melindra's second vow. The light from his sword then slowly begins to fade, until it returns to its normal state.
"Is that it?" Melindra asks. "Are we done?"

"Yes," Daren says. "The oath is done."

"Perfect!" Melindra says, regaining her smile. "So I'm guessing that your team will consist of you, the ice mage, the girl with the banshee, the giant shapeshifting as a dwarf, and..."

Melindra stops suddenly, just as she was about to point towards me, and then she starts simply staring at me, without saying anything.

"The dwarf was a giant?..." Leila writes, surprised, but we are all too focused on the stillwater girl to pay attention to her writing.

Melindra starts heading towards me, with her eyebrows furrowed in concentration, and she stops less than one foot away from me, studying me closely.

"Hmm..." Melindra says, with a pondering look, as she studies me from head to toe.

 Seeing the girl up-close, I can't help but notice that she has a rather cute face, which is nicely complemented by her light-brown hair that she wears in a high ponytail. The pajama-like clothes that she is wearing in broad daylight may look a bit ridiculous at first sight, but unlike Eiden's clothes, the ones that Melindra is wearing seem to have been chosen with a bit more care, from an aesthetical point of view. Also, unlike regular pajamas, while these clothes definitely look comfortable to move in, they also seem to have been designed to fit in a way that highlights the slim frame of her body and the shape of her breasts.
"Hmm..." Melindra says again, this time bringing her face much closer to mine, with the same pondering look in her eyes, as she strokes her chin with her right hand.

 "That's not enough," Daren says. "You also need to swear that as soon as you're done leading us to this person, you will personally guarantee that they lend us the device, and that the deal will not be considered over until this device is actually in our hands."
"Fine," Melindra says. "I swear it."

Daren moves his hand over the sword again, confirming Melindra's second vow.

"For your third, and final vow," Daren says, "do you swear that you will guarantee our safety from your friend with the device or any of their associates if they try to attack us, and that our deal will not be over until you've left us somewhere safe, with the pinecone detector in our arms?"

"Yes, I swear," Melindra says.

Daren moves his hand over the sword one last time, and then the light from the sword slowly begins to fade, until his weapon returns to normal.

"Is that it?" Melindra asks. "Are we done?"

"Yes," Daren says. "The oath is done."

"Perfect!" Melindra says, regaining her smile. "So I'm guessing that your team will consist of you, the ice mage, the girl with the banshee, the giant shapeshifting as a dwarf, and..."

Melindra stops suddenly, just as she was about to point towards me, and then she starts simply staring at me, without saying anything.

 "The dwarf was a giant?..." Leila writes, surprised, but we are all too focused on the stillwater girl to pay attention to her writing.
Melindra starts heading towards me, with her eyebrows furrowed in concentration, and she stops less than one foot away from me, studying me closely.

"Hmm..." Melindra says, with a pondering look, as she studies me from head to toe.

 "Is there something you--" I start to say, but the girl interrupts me.
"Turn around!" she says.

Melindra does not wait for me to turn around, and she grabs me by the shoulders, turning me around by herself. After a few more seconds of silence, the stillwater girl finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she gasps loudly, in astonishment.

"What?" I ask her, as I turn to face her. "What is it?"

"You're a half-lessathi, aren't you?" Melindra says, with a mixture of shock and excitement in her voice. "That's why your aura seemed so familiar! I'm a half-lessathi too! It's so nice to finally meet someone of my own race after all this time! There used to be thousands of us before the still winter, but the lessathi have gotten much stricter with their rules since then, and there aren't very many of them left either, so you barely get to see any half-lessathi these days."

She pauses.

"Wait," she says. "So that's why Eiden has taken an interest in your group!"

"What do you mean?" I say. "What's so special about me being a half-lessathi? Does it have anything to do with my stat device?"

"Oh, no," Melindra says. "Not with your stat device."

"Then with what?" I say.

"I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually!" Melindra says.

 "You stillwaters sure like being cryptic, don't you?" I ask her.
Melindra smiles, but she does not answer my rhetorical question.

"Still, I'm surprised that you managed to get hold of a stat device," Melindra says. "I was also curious to see what effect a stat device would have in a tournament like this, given my half-lessathi aura, so I tried to buy one before coming here, but there weren't any for sale anywhere I looked!"

"On which continent?" I ask. "I bought mine in the Western Continent. Where I come from, you can pretty much find these on every corner of the street."

"I tried looking in the Western Continent as well," Melindra says. "In more than one city. All of the shop owners told me that they went out of stock several weeks before I tried to make my purchase."

"Wait..." I say. "Come to think of it, I also had a bit more trouble than I expected when I tried to buy my stat booster. I actually had to visit several shops before I could find one, and that was more than a month ago. In fact, I remember many of the shop owners being very evasive when I asked them when they would replenish their stocks. It seemed almost as if they were afraid to talk about it. Do you think that these merchants might have been lying about their stock, because they'd been threatened by someone who did not want them to be selling the devices anymore?"

"Never mind, that!" Melindra says. "Could you lend me your stat device for a moment? I'm curious to see how well it resonates with my aura!"

"Fine!" Melindra says, with a pout. "I didn't need your device anyway!"

"Excuse me," Leila writes, as she pulls lightly on Melindra's sleeve.

"Yes?" Melindra says, looking at Leila, curiously.

"I have a question," Leila writes. "Are you able to tell the difference between lessathi and half-lessathi just by the feel of their aura?"

"Yes," Melindra says. "I've met enough half-lessathi in my lifetime to be able to make the distinction. You need to have a pretty keen magical sense to notice the difference, though."

I take the device out of my pocket and I hand it to Melindra.

Upon seeing the stats on its screen, Melindra raises an eyebrow, and then she looks back at me in disbelief.

"Seriously?" she says. "You haven't even invested a single point in your stats until now?"

"What can I say?" I tell her. "I like living on the edge!"

"Hmm..." Melindra says, looking at me curiously for a few seconds, but then she turns her gaze back to the device.

After she looks at it for a few seconds, the girl begins to press the side buttons of the device, multiple times, in quick succession.

"Wait, hold on!" I tell her. "You promised that you wouldn't--"

"Shhh!" Melindra tells me, with a very serious look on her face.

After a few seconds of silence, Melindra hands me back the device, looking rather displeased.

 "It's not working," she says. "I suppose that my aura has changed too much since I became a stillwater for the device to recognize me as a half-lessathi anymore. Too bad."
"What were you doing just now?" I ask Melindra. "I saw you fiddling with the stat device's buttons, but nothing seems to have changed."

"Oh," Melindra says. "I just used a code to increase the hearing stat temporarily by a few points, in order to see if my actual hearing sense improves or not. It's meant to be used as a test, to see how well the stat device reacts to your aura before you start using it. The code only works for the hearing stat, and it can only be activated once per day, for a few seconds."

"Can you give me the code?" I ask her.

"Sure," Melindra says. "It's three times left, three times right, two times left, four times right, then left right left right. Oh, and you need to do it within five seconds, or the code won't activate."

"Three left, three right, two left, four right, left right left right, got it!" I say. "Thanks a lot!"

"You're welcome!" Melindra says.

 "Excuse me," Leila writes, as she pulls lightly on Melindra's sleeve.

 "Could you..." Leila starts to write, but she pauses for a few seconds.
"Could you tell me if I'm a half-lessathi as well?" Leila continues.

"A half-lessathi?" Melindra asks, surprised.

She gets closer to Leila and she furrows her eyebrows, like she did with me, earlier.

"Hmm..." Melindra says, while she studies her for a few seconds. "No, you're definitely not a half-lessathi. This is a regular lessathi aura any way I look at it."

"I see..." Leila writes, with a faint smile on her face. "Thank you for your answer!"

Seeing her relieved smile, I suddenly remember the story she told me about the lessathi from her youth that treated her like some kind of reject because she was mute, and who were accusing her of being a half-lessathi, due to her disability. It seems that those people's slander had in fact affected her a lot more than she let on until now.

"Well," Melindra says, as she turns to the rest of us, "I believe that we're done for the day! If nobody else has any objections, I would very much like it if we could begin our journey tomorrow, at the crack of dawn."

"Actually," Daren says, "we still need to get some papers from the king, before we can leave the city. We'll be visiting him later today, but it's not guaranteed that he'll have them ready by the time we get there. Hold on!"

 Daren takes his backpack off, and he pulls a transceiver out of it, which he then hands over to Melindra.
"We'll contact you through this transceiver in case our plans change," Daren says. "Don't worry about the range. It's been enchanted to cover very long distances, so we'll be able to contact you no matter where you are in the city."

"Okay, then," Melindra says, as she puts the transceiver in one of her pockets. "If nothing changes, then we'll meet at the city's northern gate, as soon as the sun rises. We'll need to head north to reach Ollendor anyway, so we might as well meet at the gate that's closest to our destination."

"Sounds good," Daren says.

"I'll see you all tomorrow!" Melindra says, with a smile, and then she goes on her way.

"Damn it!" I say, as I watch her leave. "She still didn't tell us how you can become a stillwater."

"You'll have all the time you need to ask her that question starting tomorrow," Daren says. "We'll be travelling together for a while, remember?"

"Oh, right..." I say.

"Anyway," Daren says, "we should probably be heading for the palace. The king seemed rather busy, and I'm not sure how long he'll be waiting for us."

 "He told me that we should wait for about an hour before heading for the palace," I say, "because he still had to arrange a few things with his army. I suggest we do some shopping in the meantime. I've seen plenty of shops while we were walking between the palace and the arena, and we won't really get any other chance to buy stuff for a very long time after we leave Thilias."
"Yeah, that would probably be for the best," Daren says.

 "Well," Enrique says, "since it's been settled that you'll be spending the night in Thilias, I believe that there will no longer be any objections to the celebration tonight, yes?"
Daren sighs.

"Do as you wish," he says.

"Perfect!" Enrique says. "I know some of the best cooks in Thilias, and there are still plenty of expensive wine bottles left in the cellar. Tonight, we shall have a feast that will put the king's royal banquets to shame!"

"Just make sure you don't overdo it," Daren says. "We'll be leaving before sunrise, so we can't afford to stay up until too late in the evening."

Once we wave goodbye to Enrique, we start heading towards the castle of Thilias, at a leisurely pace. As soon as we set out, Arraka begins making muffled noises again, from inside her amulet.

"What is it, Arraka?..." Flower says, as she opens the amulet.

"I can't believe the nerve on that girl!" Arraka shouts, with her voice sounding like three separate voices talking at the same time again. "Did you see what she did? She just closed my amulet without even so much as a 'hello'! Is that any way to act with someone that you've known for hundreds of years?"

 "You know, I've always meant to ask," I say, to Arraka. "What's up with that voice of yours? Most of the time it sounds normal, but there are times when it sounds as if there are three of you talking at the same time. Is that what happens when banshees get old?"
"Oh, no, it has nothing to do with age," Arraka says. "Those two other voices are from the first two spirits that I absorbed, while I was still in the magical plane. Uh... Elkira and Rinaru, I think?... It's been too long. I don't remember their names that clearly anymore."

"The first two spirits?" I say. "You mean that you've absorbed more than two spirits while you were on the magical plane?"

"Oh, yeah, I've absorbed hundreds of them," Arraka says. "The method that I used for absorbing other spirits was still experimental when I used it on Elkira and Rinaru, which is why their voices still pop up from time to time, even after all those thousands of years. I didn't have any more problems with absorbing all of the other spirits, though."

"But, didn't the other spirits try to stop you?" I ask her.

"Of course they did," Arraka says. "But I was only getting stronger with each spirit that I absorbed, and by the time the really strong spirits figured out what I was doing, I was already too much for them to handle."

Once we wave goodbye to Rose, we start heading towards the castle of Thilias, at a leisurely pace. As soon as we set out, Arraka begins making muffled noises again, from inside her amulet.

 "What happens to the spirits that you absorb? Are they still alive inside of you?"
"Sort of," Arraka says. "Technically they're still there, but they're in a dormant state, and they're not conscious of anything that's happening around them. The absorption process is irreversible, so they may as well be dead, for all the difference it would make."

"So, what did the gods have to say about all of this?" I say. "Didn't you say that they live on the magical plane too? Why couldn't they just unite against you in order to kill you off?"

"Hah!" Arraka says. "You don't think they tried? The 'gods' are nothing special. They're just magical spirits like the rest of us. They only started calling themselves that after they found out that they could harness energy from the beings on the earthen plane, as long as they made them into their loyal followers. Once they gained enough followers, all of that worshipping went to their heads, and they began to call themselves gods, as if they were somehow more special than the rest of us. All of their 'godly' powers that they gained from their worshippers still didn't help them when I killed half of their kind by myself, though."

 "Yeah, but to be fair, it was mostly the weaker ones, who didn't have that many followers," Arraka says. "The stronger ones like the God of Death, the God of Fate and the God of Time managed to hold their own against me pretty well, so we went on a bit of a stalemate for some time, while I went to absorb more spirits, and they tried to gather more followers."

"No, it was some time after that," Arraka says. "When they realized that they couldn't amass their followers with the speed that I was absorbing other spirits, they had some sort of a meeting, where they invited all of the powerful spirits in the realm, including the ones who did not call themselves gods, like the golden fox, who was still in the magical plane at the time. In that meeting, they decided to ban me from their realm, along with every other female spirit that belonged to what you people call 'civilized races' here on the earthen plane.

 "Is this the reason why you got banned from the magical plane?"
"Eh..." Arraka says. "It was probably part of the reason. Mostly it was because of my murdering sprees, I think."

"Murdering sprees?..." I say.

"Yeah," Arraka says. "There isn't really much to do in the magical plane. Most of the spirits tend to just live for the sole purpose of maintaining their existence. It's pretty uncommon for a spirit from the magical plane to die of old age, so as long as you don't do anything too risky, you could theoretically go on living forever. That's why it's so hilarious to kill a spirit in the magical plane. On the earthen plane, most living beings will expect to die at some point, but the great majority of the spirits on the magical plane fancy themselves as immortals.  The desperation with which they cling to life in their final moments cannot be compared with that of any being on this plane of existence, which is what makes it all the more satisfying when you do them in."

"So, what did the gods have to say about all of this?" I say. "Didn't you say that they live on the magical plane too? Why couldn't they just unite against you in order to kill you off?"

 "Wait, you have different races in the magical plane?"
"Not just different races," Arraka says. "They're the exact same races that you have here on the earthen plane. Including the monster races and the animal races, of course. It's not like we have bodies or anything, but you can tell our races from our auras, just like you can on this plane of existence."

"Hold on," I say. "Does this mean that our spirits will go to the magical plane after we die?"

"Nah," Arraka says. "You don't have spirits. You only have souls. When you die, the ethereal matter that makes up your soul gets decomposed and it melds with the rest of the ethereal plane. The same goes for the souls of us, magical spirits. It's possible that the souls that get decomposed after you die somehow get recycled and then they get linked with a newborn spirit from the magical plane, but that's just a theory. None of the spirits on the magical plane have any sort of memories from past lives on the earthen plane, or anything like that."

"So, uh..." I say. "Getting back to your exile from the magical plane... do you know why the gods and the other powerful spirits decided to also ban the other female spirits and not just you?"

 "Oh," Arraka says, "it's because I was only absorbing female spirits from the so-called 'civilized races', which made them think that there was something dangerous about the others too, and that they could turn out like me if left alone for too long. In reality, the only reason why I was absorbing just these types of spirits was because they were the only ones that had auras similar enough to mine for me to be able to absorb them, given that I'm an elf. There was nothing special about the spirits I was absorbing. The 'danger' of someone coming up with the same absorption technique as I did is still there, even after they threw us all out, but I wouldn't expect them to invent anything similar anytime soon, since they're way too stupid to come up with a spell that's so complex on their own."
"Wait, you're an elf?" I ask her.

"Of course I'm an elf!" Arraka says. "What did you think I was?"

"Well, I don't know," I say. "I always kind of figured that banshees were their own race, and I didn't really give it much thought until now."

"Banshees aren't a race!" Arraka says. "It's just a name that was given to us by the locals after we got banished to the earthen realm. You can clearly tell what our races are from our auras. Seriously, how bad is your magical sense, anyway? Illuna is an elf too, but I bet you didn't know that either, did you?"

"Petal's an elf?" Flower asks, shocked.

 "Why are you acting so surprised?" Illuna says. "You have a clear image of how I look inside your own mind. Don't tell me that this is the first time you've noticed my pointy ears in the past two decades..."
"Oh, I've noticed them," Flower says, "but I always figured that this was just the way I imagined you, and that it didn't have anything to do with the way you really looked."

"So," I say, "you're telling me that we've been treating you two as if you were part of a monster race, but all this time you were in fact elven spirits?"

"Yes, that's what we are saying," Illuna says.

"It never ceases to amaze me just how bad these people can be at reading auras," Arraka says. "No wonder they still haven't figured out why their women can't be born as mages after all this time. If they can't even tell our races apart, then they have no chance of figuring it out by themselves."

 "The fox originated from the magical plane? How did she end up here, then?"
"Why don't you ask her yourself?" Arraka says. "You're friends with her now, aren't you?"

" 'Friends' isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe our relationship with her," I say.

"Well, the only thing I know," Arraka says, "is that even before I got banned from the magical plane, the fox seemed to have taken a great interest in the animals that lived here, in Varathia. They were much more intelligent than the animals on the other continents, for some reason, and from what I've heard, the fox always talked about how unfairly these animals from Varathia were being treated on the earthen plane. I'm not sure when she decided to come here, but from what I could tell, she must have made a pact with all of the plants and animals from the region, so they would join together in some sort of a symbiotic relationship that would help her maintain a physical body, in exchange for her offering them protection. I don't really know more than that, since I've been trapped in a mountain while all of this happened."

"So, uh..." I say. "Getting back to your exile from the magical plane... do you know why the gods and the other powerful spirits decided to also ban the other female spirits and not just you?"

 "Why are you acting so surprised?" Illuna says. "You have a clear image of how I look inside your own mind. Don't tell me that this is the first time you've noticed my pointy ears in the past two decades..."
"Oh, I've noticed them," Flower says, "but I always figured that this was just the way I imagined you, and that it didn't have anything to do with the way you really looked."

"So," I say, "you're telling me that we've been treating you two as if you were part of a monster race, but all this time you were in fact elven spirits?"

"Yes, that's what we are saying," Illuna says.

"It never ceases to amaze me just how bad these people can be at reading auras," Arraka says. "No wonder they still haven't figured out why their women can't be born as mages after all this time. If they can't even tell our races apart, then they have no chance of figuring it out by themselves."

 "Oh," Arraka says, "it's because I was only absorbing female spirits from the so-called 'civilized races', which made them think that there was something dangerous about the others too, and that they could turn out like me if left alone for too long. In reality, the only reason why I was absorbing just these types of spirits was because they were the only ones that had auras similar enough to mine for me to be able to absorb them, given that I'm an elf. There was nothing special about the spirits I was absorbing. The 'danger' of someone coming up with the same absorption technique as I did is still there, even after they threw us all out, but I wouldn't expect them to invent anything similar anytime soon, since they're way too stupid to come up with a spell that's so complex on their own."
"Wait, you're an elf?" I ask her.

"Of course I'm an elf!" Arraka says. "What did you think I was?"

"Well, I don't know," I say. "I always kind of figured that banshees were their own race, and I didn't really give it much thought until now."

"Banshees aren't a race!" Arraka says. "It's just a name that was given to us by the locals after we got banished to the earthen realm. You can clearly tell what our races are from our auras. Seriously, how bad is your magical sense, anyway? Illuna is an elf too, but I bet you didn't know that either, did you?"

"Petal's an elf?" Flower asks, shocked.

 "Did you..." I say, but I pause for a few moments to rearrange my thoughts. "Did you just imply that the reason why women cannot be born as mages on our earthen plane is directly related to your exile from the magical plane?"
After hearing my last sentence, Kate, who didn't seem to be paying very close attention to our conversation until now, has finally turned her head towards us, and she is now watching us intently.

"So you finally figured it out, eh, Barry-boy?" Arraka says. "What is it that tipped you off? Is it perhaps the fact that all of the banshees are practically humanoid female spirits? Or maybe the fact that female animals and monsters can still cast magic, while your women are completely unable to do it, unless their auras have been drastically altered? Oh... or maybe it's the fact that women only gain magic when they are possessed by banshees. That's a pretty big hint, if you ask me! Hell, you even had Flower as an example. Her element is fire, while Illuna's element is water. It's clear that she didn't just inherit the magic from Illuna, right? Didn't it ever occur to you that in order to channel that energy from the magical plane, you need to actually create a link with a magical spirit that is at least somewhat similar to you, in nature? You didn't seriously think that you could just pull that energy out on your own, without some magical spirit to act as a funnel for you, did you?"

"So," I say, "what you are saying is that every one of the mages on the earthen plane is in fact linked with a spirit from the magical plane?"

 "Well, yeah, but it's not like either of them is doing it consciously," Arraka says. "Since they're on different planes of existence, the link does not need to be all close and personal. Most mages probably just link themselves to a spirit instinctively, and neither them, nor the spirits that they are linked to ever notice this for the rest of their lives. But you can't link yourself unconsciously with a spirit anymore if all of the spirits with similar auras to you are here, on the earthen plane instead. You can still try to cast magic through other means, sure, but then your aura would need to become something completely different. Like that of the stillwater girl, for example. Or that of your friend with the ice magic."
"But how did these spirits manage to exile you to a completely different plane of existence?" I say. "Surely, it can't have been as simple as just throwing you out and locking the door behind you!"

"Oh, the exile was Memphir's idea, from what I've heard," Arraka says. "He always did have the talent to come up with crazily elaborate plans like these, even though only half of them usually worked out in his favor in the end."

"Memphir is the God of Fate, right?" I say.

 "Yeah, the one with the illusions," Arraka says. "I'm not sure how he came up with the idea, or how he managed to actually convince so many of the spirits to follow his plan, but what they basically did was to mess with the whole system that is in charge of assigning spirits to the magical plane, and they reprogrammed it in a way that assigns female spirits of the civilized races to the earthen plane instead."
"You can do that?" I say.

"Well, obviously it's not easy," Arraka says. "And you need a tremendous amount of energy to pull it off even if you figure out how to do it, but the bastards managed to rally enough of the spirits on their side to actually get the job done."

 "So, why didn't you just change it back to how it was, after they sent you here?" I say. "Shouldn't you have more than enough energy to do it after absorbing all of those spirits?"
"I can't do it from here!" Arraka says. "That's why we're stuck. If I were to undo everything that Memphir and his crew did, I'd need to access the Magium directly, and I can't do that from the earthen plane."

"The Magium?..." I ask her.

"Well, not really the Magium," Arraka says. "You get what I mean..."

"No..." I say. "I don't, actually..."

"You know..." Arraka says. "I'm talking about the part of the Magium that specifically deals with the creation of magical spirits and then sends them to the magical plane. You know how it works, right? Spirits aren't made to reproduce, even if they are split into males and females like you are here on the earthen plane. That's why there's this sort of... nest, or whatever you want to call it within the Magium that makes sure to pump out new spirits and to send them to the magical plane after the old ones die, in order to have roughly the same amount of spirits on the magical plane at any given time. Except these bastards managed to change the way it works! As soon as they were done tampering with the nest, it even sent the ones of us who were already there to the earthen plane, not to mention all the new ones that were created after that. And even from Varathia, the only parts of the Magium that I can access are the ones that I don't need!"

 "Other parts of the Magium?..." I say, confused. "I don't get it. Just how big is this Magium, exactly? Wasn't it supposed to be some sort of a powerful artifact that's only found here in Varathia?"
Arraka takes a long break before she speaks again, during which we all wait for her answer in silence.

"Did..." she says, struggling to find her words. "Did you just ask me how big the Magium is?"

"Yeah, that's what I said," I say.

After another short pause, Arraka suddenly begins to laugh, louder than she's ever laughed before, and she keeps on going for about ten seconds before she speaks again.

"Hey..." Arraka says, while she's almost out of breath from laughing, "Hey, Illuna, did you... Did you hear what he said? He asked how big the Magium is! Aha-AHAHAHAHA!"

"Stop laughing, damn it!" I say, as I finally snap. "Tell me what you know about the Magium!"

 "Ahahahaha!" Arraka says. "You came here to fight for the Magium, but you don't even know what it is? Oh, man, that's rich! I'd be crying from laughter if I weren't living in an amulet without a body. I can't believe you people... You actually... You actually came here without even... Ahahahaha!"
"Knock it off!" I tell her. "Are you going to tell me what the Magium is or not?"

Arraka ignores me completely and she just keeps laughing and laughing, without giving signs of planning to stop anytime soon.

"Let it go, Barry," Daren says, as he places a hand on my shoulder. "If she doesn't want to tell us, then no amount of spinning is going to make her change her mind. We'll just have to find out what the Magium is on our own."

"I know what the Magium is!" Flower says.

"You do?" I ask her.

"Yeah," Flower says.

"Well, what is it?" I say.

"Oh, I can't tell you that!" Flower says.

"Why the hell not?" I say.

"Because I'm not allowed to," Flower says, simply.

"Not allowed by whom?" I ask her. "The kings? Are the kings of Varathia prohibiting you from revealing the true nature of the Magium to the tournament participants?"

"I... can't answer that question," Flower says, looking a bit uncomfortable.

 "But why?" I say. "What will happen if you tell us about the Magium?"
"We'll die," Illuna says, bluntly.

"You mean that they'll send someone to execute you?" I say.

"No, I mean we'll drop dead," Illuna says. "On the spot. Quite possibly even before we get to tell you what the Magium actually is."

"What do you mean?" Hadrik asks Illuna. "Why would you drop dead just from answering a question?"

"She's saying that they're under an enchanter's oath," Daren says. "They've probably been made to vow that they won't reveal the nature of the Magium to anyone. Either by the kings or by someone else. They're likely risking death even with what little they're already telling us. We should stop questioning them about this before Flower accidentally lets slip too much information and kills them both by accident."

 I wait for Arraka to stop laughing by herself, and when her laughter finally dies out, I repeat my question.
"So, now that you're done laughing," I say, "are you planning to tell us what the Magium is, or not?"

"Why not?" I say.

"Because there would be no fun in me telling you directly," Arraka says. "You need to work for it! Isn't that why you are here?"

 "Why are you acting so disappointed?" Daren says. "It's not like you were ever aiming to win the Magium. You've already told us that you're only in this for the challenge."
"Well, yeah," Hadrik says, "but imagine the stories we could tell if we managed to get our hands on the Magium before the end of the tournament!"

"It's not going to happen," Daren says. "Even if we find out what it is, it's probably too well guarded or too well hidden for us to be able to do anything about it. We should be focusing on our objectives, and not on trying to cheat the system. Come on, let's get moving. We still need to do some shopping before we go to the king."

As we continue to travel towards the castle, we notice that Leila and Kate are walking side by side, but they've hardly been exchanging any words since we left the arena. After a while, Daren pulls me to the back of the group, where him and Hadrik are walking at a slower pace, and he asks me a question, in a low voice.

"Hey, Barry," Daren says, "correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't Kate and the white haired girl supposed to be childhood friends or something?"

"Sort of," I say. "They both grew up at the Beacon, but from what I've heard, Leila was more isolated from the rest of the group, due to her being a lessathi."

"Still," Daren says, "if they've known each other for so long, don't you think that they should have a little more to talk about? Maybe we could give them a push or something. You know, help them out a bit so they can get over the initial awkwardness."

 "I say we wait a little more," I tell Daren. "Neither of them are exactly the talkative sort, and Leila is mute to boot. We should give them a bit more time to get comfortable around each other before we butt in."
"You know, I was thinking," Hadrik tells me, "if Leila is a lessathi, then shouldn't you be giving her Eiden's message? The one about the still winter?"

"Hey, you're right!" I tell him. "I'll tell her right now!"

"Barry..." Daren starts to say, but I ignore him and I call out to Leila.

"Hey, Leila!" I shout.

"Yes?..." Leila writes, as she turns around to face me.

"I've got a message from Eiden," I say.

"Eiden?" Leila writes. "You mean the stillwater who threatened the dragon in the arena?"

"Yeah, that's him!" I say. "He says to remember the still winter!"

"Damn it, Barry!" Daren says, in a low voice. "Don't you think you should be taking this message thing a little more seriously? We almost died because of it the last time Eiden brought it up."

"Relax," I whisper to Daren. "My deal with Eiden is already off. I was supposed to deliver his message to the first lessathi I encountered, remember? The first lessathi I met were Diane's friends. The reason why Eiden almost killed us was exactly because I failed to uphold my end of the bargain. The fact that he got over it so quickly and that he never actually killed us, shows that he never really cared about that deal in the first place. If he really wanted that message delivered, he could have just teleported next to the lessathi and told them the message himself, given that he already recognized their auras from a distance when I met them. Realistically speaking, Eiden probably already forgot about that message, and he'll never mention it to us again."

"I hope you're right..." Daren says. 

"At any rate," I say, "my joke from earlier was not made without a reason. Look!"

I then point towards Kate and Leila, who are still engaged in conversation, except the subject of their talk seems to have changed from Eiden and his plans to how much of an idiot I am.

 "See?" I tell Daren, in a low voice. "Now they have something to talk about!"
Half an hour after our conversation, we reach the first marketplace on our way to the castle. We decide to split up into separate groups and to meet up again in the center of the marketplace once we're each done with our shopping. While Kate goes together with Leila in order to help her buy some new clothes and a backpack, Daren and I head for the weapons shop, so I can buy myself a new crossbow and so that Daren can buy a new magical sharpening stone. In the meantime, Flower and Illuna went to buy some potions, while Hadrik, who did not need to buy anything in particular, went directly towards the center of the market, waiting for us to be done.

Before we enter the shop, I show Daren my scimitars, while asking him if he could tell me what enchantments are cast on them, and if he could estimate the market value of the items. 

"Hmm..." Daren says. "Both of these seem to have the same two enchantments. Sharpness and durability. However, the enchantments were done almost exclusively by using elven steel, and the craftsmanship of the weapons is also of high quality. If I were you, I wouldn't sell one of these for less than fifty western gold coins."

 Once we are inside the weapons shop, the first thing I do is to approach the shopkeeper about my scimitars. It takes a bit of haggling, but in the end I manage to convince him to buy one of the two weapons for seventy gold coins, while keeping the other one for myself. As soon as I am done with the selling, I immediately move over to the crossbow section, to see if I can find anything that would fit my needs.

Two of the crossbows on display catch my eye, and they are both much better than the one I've got, but one of them is a lot more expensive than the other. I could buy either of them with the money I have, but if I bought the expensive one, I'd have to be very careful with my budget in the future, and I likely would not afford to make any more expensive purchases for the duration of my stay here in Varathia.

The advantage of the expensive one is that I can use it to shoot seven bolts before reloading, and it also has better power, range, and accuracy. The cheaper version is still better than the crossbow I have in every way, but it's not really comparable to the expensive one, and it can only fire six bolts before reloading.

I look around the ranged weapons section one more time to see if there aren't any other repeating crossbows that might interest me, but most of them are either not worth their price, or worse than the one that I already have. I guess I'm going to have to make a choice between the two crossbows that I was looking at earlier, after all.

 I decide to buy the cheaper crossbow. It's already leagues better than the one that I have, and it's not like I'm planning to participate in a sharpshooting contest. There is no need for me to buy the most expensive option available.
Once we're done buying what we need, I put my new crossbow inside my backpack, and then Daren and I exit the shop, heading directly for the middle of the marketplace. As we walk, I suddenly remember that there was something else I needed to buy while I'm still in town, so I tell Daren to go ahead, and I go to enter the potions shop.

"Barry?" Flower asks, as she sees me enter the building. "Didn't you go to buy some weapons?"

"Yeah," I say. "But I remembered that I also had something to buy from here."

"What are you buying?" Flower asks.

"...An anti-poison elixir," I say, a little embarrassed.

Flower's eyes turn blue, and Illuna just stares at me for a few seconds, without saying anything.

 "Remember to also get an anti-disease elixir while you're at it," Illuna says, finally. "They're more expensive than anti-poison ones, and they only work for certain, easily curable illnesses, but still, it would be rather pathetic if you were to die from some Varathian disease after having survived the tournament for so long."
I pay the shopkeeper ten copper pieces for the anti-poison elixir and a silver coin for the anti-disease elixir, and then I drink them both while I'm still inside the shop. Illuna does the same for all the potions she's bought, and then we both exit the building, heading towards the middle of the marketplace, where Hadrik and Daren were waiting for us. As we approach them, I notice that the two of them are in the middle of a rather heated debate about who would be the winner in a duel between Azarius, the Sage of the West, and Talmak, the Sage of the North.

"Listen," Hadrik tells Daren, as we get closer, "I know that Azarius can cast a lot of spells. That's not the point. What I'm saying is that in terms of raw power, Talmak is way above the Sage of the West. Plus, he's an earth elementalist! What use are a bunch of spells, when he's just going to crush you between two huge layers of rock?"

 I decide to buy the more expensive crossbow. I don't have any other ranged attacks, so I shouldn't be thinking about saving money, here. Quality is much more important.

 "Hadrik," Daren says, "I get that you're trying to take Talmak's side because he's a dwarf, but that's just not how things work in a magic duel. You can't win a fight through raw power alone. You need to have some versatility. As a generalist, Azarius can use spells of many different types, which makes his attacks a lot more unpredictable. Specialists will always be at a disadvantage when fighting against generalists for this reason. That's why I tried my best to master both enchantment and white magic, during my lifetime. Limiting myself to only one specialization would have given me far less options when fighting against other trained mages."
"Oh, come on!" Hadrik says. "It's not like Talmak can only cast earth magic. You've seen him at the last year's sage contest. He can cast lightning magic too. And a whole bunch of other spells!"

"Yes," Daren says. "Basic spells. I never saw him cast any complex spells outside of his own specialization."

"Does it matter if they're simple spells?" Hadrik says. "He can just use his huge energy to boost them and then they'll be just as strong as the more complex spells!"

 "That would just be a waste of magical energy!" Daren says. "There's a reason why more complex versions of the basic spells were invented. It's because they're cost-effective."
"Why would Talmak care about cost?" Hadrik says. "He has plenty of energy to spare. It's not like we've ever seen him run out of energy in a duel before. Hell, as far as we know, his magical regeneration abilities may well be high enough that he can gain his energy back before he even has a chance to spend it!"

"Ugh!" Daren says. "Barry, can you believe this guy? He's actually trying to make a case that Azarius would lose in a fight against Talmak!"

 "He does have a point, though. I mean, Azarius is pretty old."
"Hah!" Hadrik says. "See? Not even Barry thinks he'd win! And he's from the Western Continent!"

"Eh..." Daren says. "It's not like being from the Western Continent means you automatically have to root for the Sage of the West. Still, I stand by my previous statement. While Talmak may indeed give Azarius a hard time in a duel, there's no way he'd win if Azarius fought seriously."

"Fine, fine..." Hadrik says. "Okay, I've got another one for you, then! Who do you think would win in a duel between Eiden and Arraka?"

"Didn't this fight already happen, though?" I say. "During the still winter, I mean. I'm pretty sure that Eiden ripped Arraka to shreds the last time they fought."

"Well, from what I've heard," Hadrik says, "the last time they've fought it was Eiden and the fox against Arraka, so it was a two on one fight."

"Yeah," I say, "but you're forgetting that Arraka was also fused with some other stillwater at the time. So it wasn't a two on one fight, it was a two on two fight. That's close enough to a duel for me. Like I said, Eiden mopped the floor with Arraka the last time they fought."

"Hey!" Arraka says. "Hey!!! What the hell are you talking about? Nobody mopped the floor with anyone! And Therius doesn't count! He was a weakling! You can't even compare him with the golden fox, let alone Eiden!"

 "Yeah, right," I say. "If he was such a weakling, then how come you weren't even able to take over his body properly, during your awakening?"
"That has nothing to do with power, you idiot!" Arraka says. "Didn't your friend tell you about ethereals? The guy had an overwhelming advantage while we were fighting in his own mind. In a fair fight I would have annihilated him! And the same goes for Eiden!"

"Uh-huh," I say. "You say that, but you still lost against him in the still winter."

"That's because Eiden uses tricks!" Arraka says. "In terms of raw power, I'm way stronger than him!"

"Who cares if you're technically stronger than him?" I say. "Fighting isn't just about strength. You also need to know how to use it."

"This isn't about him being more skilled than me, you moron!" Arraka says. "I'm saying that he's cheating! He isn't using magic the way you're supposed to!"

"What's that supposed to mean?" I say.

 "Forget it!" Arraka says. "I'm not going to sit here and waste time explaining to you how magic works. Tell you what. Why don't you ask Eiden directly what I meant? He's been standing there invisibly right next to you for the past twenty seconds, so I'm sure he doesn't have anything better to do, at this time."
As soon as Arraka is done talking, Eiden dismisses his invisibility spell, while wearing his usual polite smile on his face, with his eyes closed.

"You just won't let me have any fun, will you, Arraka?" Eiden says.

"There's no need to be so rude," Eiden says. "Especially when I came all the way here only to congratulate you on your magnificent performance in the arena!"

"Uh-huh," Hadrik says, not looking very convinced. "You sure that's the only reason why you came here?"

"Now that you mention it, there was another reason!" Eiden says. "You see, I couldn't help but notice that the direction in which you've been heading since you left the arena leads directly to the castle of Thilias. You wouldn't happen to be going there because the king Golmyck gave you some sort of a mission, would you?"

"Why not?" Daren says.

"Because the city of Thilias will not be around for much longer," Eiden says. "And neither will any of the other cities in Varathia, for that matter."

"Wait, what..." Daren says, but he is having trouble continuing his sentence. "What are you saying?..."

 "I'm saying that shortly before the end of this tournament," Eiden says, "there will be a calamity of such proportions that it will completely eradicate every single city on this island, at the same time."
"And you're telling me that you're just going to stand idly by and watch it happen?" Daren asks, shocked. "What is wrong with you? Aren't you supposed to be the creator of this continent?"

"Actually, that's a common misconception," Eiden says. "While the people of this land may call me the Creator, the island of Varathia has been around for much longer than my lifespan. The only reason why people started to call me the Creator all those years ago was because they wanted someone to replace the old Creator, to symbolize the beginning of a new age, and they chose me to take this role because I was practically the founder of the new civilization that came after the still winter, together with the golden fox. Oh, and I think you might have slightly misunderstood what I said earlier. I will by no means stand idly by while this calamity occurs.

 "You bastard!" Daren says, with his eyes full of hatred. "I'm not going to let you do this!"
"Why, Daren," Eiden says, "I thought that you of all people would have every reason to be happy due to this turn of events! Weren't you the one who told me that as long as you never give up, you can find a way to save everyone? Well, I've found a way! A way to save them all from their misery. I assure you that a quick death would be a much better fate than most of these people deserve, and as for the rest--"

"Oh, shut up," I interrupt Eiden.

"Pardon?" Eiden asks me.

"I've had it with your crap," I say. "You're acting like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum. Whenever something doesn't go your way, you break all of the toys and make a mess of the playground, leaving the adults to clean up after you. You did the same thing with Olmnar. Is blowing up a city your standard solution to everything?"

Every one of my friends, including Daren, are looking way too shocked at my sudden outburst to be able to say anything, and they're all just staring at me in disbelief. Eiden is also looking directly at me, with his eyes closed, but his smile is now gone from his face.

"What are you getting at?" Eiden asks me, calmly.

 "I'm saying," I say, "that there's no way you can just build an entire civilization like that almost by yourself, and then in the span of only a few hundred years, you simply stop caring about what happens to any of these people and you kill them off like it's nothing. This is just you refusing to admit your mistakes. You failed. You had all the power in the world, but you still couldn't achieve what you wanted. And instead of manning up and trying to fix things, what do you do? You just sweep it all under the rug as if none of this was your fault, and then you decide to end everything by your own hand, as if that would somehow make it better. Stop this, already. You are only making a fool of yourself."
"I've heard just about enough of this," Eiden says, in a dismissive tone. "You speak without even knowing the situation in which the other cities are in. Do you think that slavery and arenas are the real problems in Varathia? You have no idea what's going on in the other kingdoms. The levels to which some of these people have stooped are much lower than what you could ever imagine."

"So, what?" I say. "Aren't you their leader? Isn't it the leader's job to make sure that his people don't go on the wrong path? How did you even manage to let it come to this? Did you just leave them all to organize themselves without even the least bit of intervention? Hell, even I would have done a better job at keeping things under control, and I know nothing about politics."

 "You're saying you could have prevented this if you had my powers?" Eiden says. "You, who could not even deliver a simple message?"
"No," I say. "I'm saying that I could have prevented this even if I had no powers at all! You, on the other hand had all the power you needed, but all you managed to do was make things worse. What was the deal with Olmnar, anyway? Did you think that by destroying that city, the fox would forgive you? Is that what you thought? Don't make me laugh! If you're seeking forgiveness, then how about you start by fixing everything you broke and by not being such a damn coward!"

Once I finish my sentence, Eiden frowns, and all of a sudden, everything around me freezes, just like that time when I first fought the dragon. He then starts slowly walking towards me, while everyone except the two of us is frozen in place. He's looking pretty pissed.

I try to jump back, but I suddenly realize that there's an invisible wall behind me, blocking my way. Eiden, who is now only one foot away from me, is looking at me with his eyes open, and a very dark expression on his face.

"What's the matter, Barry?" Eiden says, in a calm but menacing tone. "Didn't you say that I was the coward? Why are you trying to run away?"

"I wasn't running anywhere," I say. "I was just trying to cancel your spell."

"You know..." Eiden says. "It has been a very long while since someone's made me this angry. I'll have to hand it to you, Barry. You have a very unique talent at pushing people's buttons. Tell me, do you enjoy risking death with every possible opportunity? Do you really want to die that much?"

"You're not going to kill me," I say.

 "You really do like to play with fire, don't you?" Eiden says. "I think what makes me the angriest is the fact that you actually believe what you are saying. You actually believe that you would have been able to accomplish the impossible... to change human nature, without even having access to any of my powers.

"I wasn't running anywhere," I say. "I was just trying to cancel your spell."

"You know..." Eiden says. "It has been a very long while since someone's made me this angry. I'll have to hand it to you, Barry. You have a very unique talent at pushing people's buttons. Tell me, do you enjoy risking death with every possible opportunity? Do you really want to die that much?"

"You're not going to kill me," I say.

"Why not?" Eiden says.

"Because deep down, you know I'm right," I say. "Everything I said about you was true. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten so pissed off about it. Killing me now would only serve to prove my point, and that's the last thing you want."

 I decide to stand my ground and to look Eiden straight in the eyes, as he approaches me. When he gets about a foot away from me, he stops and he opens his eyes, looking at me with a very dark expression on his face. 
"You know..." Eiden says. "It has been a very long while since someone's made me this angry. I'll have to hand it to you, Barry. You have a very unique talent at pushing people's buttons. Tell me, do you enjoy risking death with every possible opportunity? Do you really want to die that much?"

 "You really do like to play with fire, don't you?" Eiden says. "I think what makes me the angriest is the fact that you actually believe what you are saying. You actually believe that you would have been able to accomplish the impossible... to change human nature, without even having access to any of my powers. Just what exactly is it that you are basing these claims on, I wonder?"
"I'm basing them," I say, "on the fact that I've already been trying to accomplish the impossible for the better part of my life! And unlike you, I have never even thought about giving up. I mean, look at me, damn it! Look at where I am! Who would be stupid or stubborn enough to go so far just for the sake of some childhood dream? And yet, here I am."

I pause for a few seconds before I continue, but I keep looking Eiden straight in the eyes, during this time.

"I don't care about human nature," I say, after a while. "After seeing how the people here are perfectly okay with other human beings getting treated like cattle, and after seeing how they consider people dying in an arena to be a form of entertainment, I think I've seen enough to know that things here need to change. And if you're no longer going to do it, then I will. I don't care if I have the power to do it or not. I will do it. I am going to do everything that you couldn't do, despite your immense power, and then I'm going to come back and shove it all in your face."

 While I was talking, some of the anger has slowly vanished from Eiden's eyes, and he now looks a bit calmer than before. I also noticed that he's been stretching his right arm to the side every once in a while ever since he stopped in front of me, but I have no idea for what reason.
"One of the benefits of being very good at reading auras," Eiden says, "is that you can tell at every point during a conversation not only if a person is lying, but also if they are hesitating in some way, from the fluctuations in their aura. The fact that you were neither lying nor being hesitant at any point during your speech just now is something that I find truly fascinating."

Eiden takes a few moments to consider his next words, while he stretches his right arm to the side once more.

 "Here's what we're going to do," he says, as he closes his eyes again, and he slowly starts to walk back and forth, over a distance of a few feet. "Whether you want to or not, this tournament is going to require you to visit a certain number of cities. You already know that you'll be visiting Galamir, and since you've met Melindra, I'm going to assume that you'll also be visiting Ollendor soon enough. There may also be other cities, depending on what the tournament's organizers prepare for the next rounds. I'm going to be monitoring your activity in these cities from afar, to see how much you can manage to change in the short time you'll have at your disposal. If you will stay true to your words from earlier, and you will indeed make radical changes through your own powers, then I will personally give you the power required to stop the calamity that is threatening these cities, and afterwards, I will leave you to shape the fate of these kingdoms in whatever way you see fit. If this unlikely scenario truly comes to pass, then I will--"
"By the gods!" I shout, interrupting him. "Arraka was right! I can't believe it. You really are cheating!"

"I beg your pardon?" Eiden says.

 "I just realized why you've been stretching your right arm every so often since you cast the time freezing spell!" I say. "And also why you've been walking back and forth for the past thirty seconds. It's because of the warning message, isn't it? I also had access to that same time freezing spell back when you powered up my stat device, so I still remember how it works! You're not allowed to move more than a few feet from your original position, so if any part of your body goes over a certain boundary, you're going to get a warning message, telling you that if you don't retreat in the next ten seconds, your spell will get cancelled."
"And what makes you think that triggering this warning helps me in any way?" Eiden asks me.

"It helps you," I say, "because whoever designed that spell never bothered to take the actual warnings into account when calculating the duration! As long as you don't go too far beyond the boundary, and you retreat at the very end of the ten second countdown, you can practically add ten more seconds to the duration of the spell every time you do this. And since the time limit of the spell has been added by design, due to safety reasons, and not due to technical limitations, you could probably lengthen the duration of this spell almost indefinitely, if you're confident enough that you can keep it under control. So, that's what Arraka and Tyrath had been talking about all this time, when they said that you were using tricks. It's not that you don't need to obey the laws of magic because you're too powerful. You're just taking advantage of technicalities to get around the rules, and you make it seem as if it was thanks to your power all along. You're using loopholes!"

 "While I do commend you for figuring this out all by yourself," Eiden says, "I really don't see how this could possibly help you with--"
"It was the same with Daren, wasn't it?" I say. "That time when you put him to sleep despite all of his protections was also because you exploited some technicality, and not because your spell ignored all the laws of magic!"

"Oh?" Eiden asks, while raising his eyebrows with his eyes closed. "And what technicality might that be?"

After pausing for a few seconds to think, the answer suddenly comes to me, as if it were as clear as the light of day.

"Protection overload..." I say, as I see Eiden's expression change a bit, even with his eyes closed. "That's it, isn't it? I heard that this only happens to very skilled mages that go overboard with casting protections on themselves, without taking into account that some of those spells might actually do more harm than good, because they are in conflict with each other. If you're not careful, you could end up generating small openings in your defenses that could easily be exploited by someone that is skilled at reading the flow of auras. I could totally see Daren making a mistake like this." 

 "Extraordinary!" Eiden says, with his smile back on his face. "I've used that trick countless times against many formidable foes in the past, and yet nobody managed to figure it out until now. However, I still do not see how this would help you and your group if you were ever to fight me seriously. Leaving aside the fact that I've had hundreds of years to learn these technicalities, even if you managed to learn them all, my level of magical power still dwarfs that of most beings on this island, with very few exceptions. I would say that you are not in a better situation now, than you were when you first met me on the second day of the tournament."
"Yes, I am," I say. "Because now I know that you're not invincible. If you needed to learn all these tricks, then it means that your power alone was not enough to help you win all of your battles. It means that you have weaknesses. And if you have weaknesses, you can be defeated."

 Eiden laughs.
"So, you aim not only to achieve what I couldn't accomplish in a lifetime," he says, "but also to eventually defeat me in an actual battle. And here I was, thinking that I wouldn't have anything interesting to do until the end of this tournament."

He pauses.

"Very well!" Eiden says. "In that case, I'll be looking forward to your progress. And I will also be monitoring your activity within the cities, as I said earlier. Now then, would you happen to have any more questions, before I take my leave?"

"Just one," I say. "What is the Magium?"

Eiden grins.

"You weren't seriously expecting to get an answer to that question so easily, were you?" he says.

"No," I say, "but it was worth a shot."

 Eiden gives me one last smile with his eyes closed, and then he teleports out of my sight. As soon as he disappears, the time freezing spell gets cancelled, and my friends begin to look around them confused, trying to figure out where Eiden went.
"So, Eiden is gone..." Daren says, after a while. "And Barry is the only one that doesn't seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Is there anything that you might want to tell us, Barry?"

"Daren..." I say. "I'm certain that you have many questions, and I'll be sure to answer them in a bit, but first I'm going to need you to do something for me."

"What's that?" Daren asks.

"Pull out a pen and paper from your backpack," I say, "and write all of the protection spells that you had cast on yourself on our second day in Varathia. We've got work to do."
