I will be here in my throne room, for the rest of the day.\"<br/><br/>\"Duly noted,\" Daren says. \"Come on, let's go back to the waiting room.\" <br/><br/>\"Well, that was.... quite the talk,\" Hadrik says, as soon as we exit the throne room.<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" Daren says, as we are making our way back to the waiting room. \"It's going to be interesting to see how things will develop from here on out, that's for sure.\"<br/><br/>\"Do you think they might try to get rid of us?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"I highly doubt that they would,\" Daren says in a low voice, as he makes sure that Peter and Albert are not within hearing range of us. \"Especially since they suspect us of being Eiden's allies. They'd have to be completely mad to risk making him into their enemy without any reason at all. Still, I suggest that we continue this conversation once we get back to the waiting room, because I don't like looking over my shoulder every few seconds to make sure that I'm not being spied on.\"<br/><br/>Once we arrive in the waiting room, we wait until Peter and Albert are no longer in sight, and then we resume our talk, in a low enough voice that the other people present in the room cannot hear us.<br/><br/> \"Anyway,\" Daren says. \"I'd say that these recent events complicate our situation quite a bit. What do you all recommend we should do? Are we going to keep cooperating with the king, or maybe we should start thinking about going our own separate ways?\"<br/>\"I don't know what to say...\" Hadrik says. \"The information that these rebels can obtain from their listening devices is pretty useful, to be honest.\"<br/><br/>\"Agreed,\" Daren says. \"The only problem is that we don't know if they'll keep sharing this sort of stuff with us or not from now on. I think it might be better to keep this 'alliance' going until we can figure out if we're still getting something out of it or not. Kate, what do you say?\"<br/><br/>\"Do what you want,\" Kate says, as she turns around and starts heading towards one of the exits. \"I'm going back to my training. Melindra, let's go.\"<br/><br/>\"Uhh, sure,\" Melindra says, as she begins to follow Kate. \"Right behind you.\"<br/><br/>",

It is the corridor that Kate and Melindra walked into when they decided to continue their training. Now that I take a better look, I realize that it's not the same corridor as the one they were using to train before the king of the underground called us to his throne room. Why would they choose a different corridor than last time? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to train in a place that they are already familiar with?<br/>Wait a minute... I'm pretty sure that there was a way to get from that corridor right into the tunnel that leads to the teleporter room. Could this be where the two of them are actually headed? I guess there's only one way to find out.<br/><br/>I begin heading towards the tunnel that leads directly to the teleporter room at a rapid pace. If I hurry up, I should still be able to catch up to them. This tunnel takes a more direct route towards the teleporter than the one they took, so the distance is much shorter. I rush through the door leading into the corridor, and then I head straight for the teleporter, without looking back. It's fine. If they really went this way, they can't be much further ahead. I should be seeing them any minute now. Any minute now...<br/><br/>My predictions turn out to be true, as I soon catch a glimpse of Kate's green cloak in the distance, and then I slow down my pace, so I can follow her and Melindra without getting noticed. Unfortunately, my plan gets shot to pieces almost immediately, when Melindra suddenly stops walking and calls out to me in a loud voice.<br/><br/>",

Because you weren't thinking about it?\"<br/><br/>\"Shut up...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"It's okay to be honest with yourself every once in a while, you know,\" Melindra says, still smiling smugly. \"Look, it's easy. Just repeat after me: 'I wanted Barry to come with us to the surface'. Come on, you can do it! I believe in you!\"<br/><br/>\"I am going to hit you...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Is it me, or are you two getting along a little better than usual?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Kate says, as she raises an eyebrow. \"When have the two of us not been getting along?\"<br/><br/>\"Uhh... on the very first day that we began traveling together, for example?...\" I say.<br/><br/> \"Oh, that was ages ago!\" Melindra says. \"I don't think we have even gotten into a single argument since that day when we defeated Talmak together. Have we, icey?\"<br/>\"You're right,\" Kate says. \"We have not.\"<br/><br/>\"If you two say so...\" I tell them.<br/><br/>\"Anyway, so now that we got that settled, let's all go to the Overseer together!\" Melindra says. \"I know my way around the city pretty well, so I think I may have a general idea of where we could find one of the green-eyed golem heads without getting caught by any of the guards.\"<br/><br/>\"You two are not planning to give up on this plan no matter what I say, are you?\" I ask them.<br/><br/>\"Obviously,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Fine,\" I say. \"How do we convince the teleporter guy to bring us to the surface, then?\"<br/><br/>\"No!\" Kate says, as she places herself in front of me. \"Barry, you can't come with us!\"<br/><br/> \"Why not?\" I say.<br/>\"Because you don't have your stat device!\" Kate says. \"You'll be defenseless!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, technically I do have my stat booster with me,\" I say, as I take my device out of my pocket to show it to her for a few seconds before putting it back inside. \"It's just that it's not really working right now. But it's supposed to start working again in a few hours or less. And even if it doesn't, I'm Barry the reckless, remember? I'm sure that I'll handle myself in one way or another.\"<br/><br/>\"I thought you were supposed to be working on being less reckless,\" Kate tells me.<br/><br/>\"True, but technically you were supposed to be working on trusting your friends more too, so I guess we're even,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Do you guys have room for one more, or are you done taking extra passengers?\" we suddenly see a blue text floating in front of us.<br/><br/>As we turn around, we see that Leila is now slowly approaching us as well, smiling faintly.<br/><br/>",

The last thing we'd want is for them to get into a fight with the royal guards again by mistake.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, so you're not planning to get into any fights, then,\" the teleporter guy says.<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" Breynan says. \"Hopefully it will be just a short uneventful trip, and we'll be back right in time for dinner.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, remember that if you do get into a fight, I won't be able to teleport you out of there properly until you're all safely away and you've calmed yourselves down,\" the teleporter guy says. \"We wouldn't want to have another accident, like that time with Desmond.\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, Barry, we'll be careful,\" Breynan says.<br/>\"Oh, and don't forget to actually return to the designated teleportation area before calling me on the transceiver this time!\" the teleporter guy says. \"The emergency teleportation feature puts too much strain on this device to be used just for the sake of convenience!\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, okay, I get it,\" Breynan says. \"Just make sure that you teleport us to the usual coordinates, alright? I don't want us to run into any trouble while we're up there.\"<br/><br/>\"Roger that!\" the teleporter guy says, as he presses on some buttons. \"Have a safe trip!\"<br/><br/>We then get surrounded by a bright white light and we begin to feel our bodies vibrating loudly, as we are being teleported to the surface. Once the teleportation process is complete, we find ourselves standing in the middle of an abandoned alleyway in what appears to be one of the poorer districts of the city. As I look up at the sky, I see that it now has a reddish color, and it likely won't be long until the sun will be setting.<br/><br/>",

I'll show you how you can track down one of those green-eyed metal balls in a matter of minutes, if you know how to look for them.\"<br/>\"What happened during the accident that your friend spoke of earlier?\" Kate says, as we all move to follow Breynan. \"When he said 'Desmond', was he referring to the same Desmond that now guards the door outside the quarantine zone?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, that was the Desmond he was referring to,\" Breynan says. \"That poor bastard had it rough. He was caught in a nasty fight once, and he asked Barry to teleport him out of there as soon as possible. It was technically against our safety precautions to do such a thing, because the teleporter device is rather old, and it has trouble properly locking onto people's auras if their flow isn't calm enough, but the situation seemed very dire, so Barry took the risk. From what Desmond described to us, the sensation he felt when he got teleported was as if his whole body was being torn to shreds. The moment after he got transported into the tunnels, he started vomiting, and he felt sick for days after that. Even after all this time, Desmond still hasn't gotten over it, and he tries to avoid using the teleporter as much as possible. That's why he personally requested to be made into a simple guard in our rebel base, so that he wouldn't need to teleport to the surface anymore unless there were an extreme emergency.\"<br/><br/> \"Damn...\" I say. \"That sounds pretty bad. Did he at least recover fully? Or is he still experiencing problems due to that failed teleportation?\"<br/>\"He did completely recover in a few days, thankfully,\" Breynan says. \"But we've never tried to do a teleportation like that again since that day. Its effects are just too unpredictable to be worth the risk. Anyway, do you guys see that flying metal ball up there in the air? It's going to circle around that area for a while, and then it should come down to do a quick patrol of that alley over there. That's where we'll have our talk. As long as we get there without being noticed, we shouldn't have much trouble. Let's go.\"<br/><br/>We manage to make our way into the alley that Breynan mentioned pretty easily, thanks to the general lack of guards in this area, and then we wait patiently for the 'droon' to come down to us. After about two minutes of circling around in the sky, the metal ball comes down, just like Breynan predicted, and it begins to hover a few feet above the ground, very close to us.<br/><br/>\"Hey, you!\" Breynan says. \"Metal ball! I want to speak to the Overseer! Do you hear me?\"<br/><br/>The metal ball turns around, so that its green eye can face Breynan directly. After a few seconds of silence, the 'droon' responds, in its usual metallic voice.<br/><br/>\"Request acknowledged,\" the metal ball says. \"Please stand by. The Overseer protocol will be initiated shortly.\"<br/><br/>",

It looks like I can't afford to hesitate anymore. I'll need to decide what to do about these men, and quick.<br/><br/> \"We can't!\" says one of the men, in a trembling voice. \"The man in black robes told us that we need to make sure you don't leave the alley. He said he'll kill our families if we don't listen to him. We can't let you pass!\"<br/>\"You don't have to do this!\" Breynan says, as he tries to slowly approach him. \"Come with us, and we'll shelter you and your families in the underground tunnels below the city. I am with the rebels. I can keep them safe!\"<br/><br/>\"Stay back!\" the man with the trembling voice says, as he swings his dagger towards Breynan. \"Don't come any closer! I'm warning you!\"<br/><br/>\"We don't have time for this,\" Kate says, and then she conjures several tall bars of ice between us and the men in rags, in order to block them from reaching us.<br/><br/>\"What are you doing?\" Breynan says. \"Now they have us right where they want us.\"<br/><br/>\"No, they don't,\" Kate says, as she's now conjuring an ice platform right below our feet. \"If we can't get past them, then we'll just need to fly over them.\"<br/><br/> Before the ice platform even has the chance to raise us from the ground, both the ice bars and the platform suddenly disappear, and Kate presses her hands against her forehead, apparently trying to suppress a severe headache.<br/>\"What happened?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"I don't know...\" Kate says, as she is keeping her eyes closed, still trying to get rid of her headache. \"I can't... concentrate... Barely able to... form sentences.\"<br/><br/>\"She's been hit with a really powerful dizziness spell,\" Melindra says. \"It blew right past her magical protections. I don't get it. There are no mages in the vicinity. Who could have cast this spell?\"<br/><br/>\"It must be someone using a lessathi device,\" Breynan says. \"Maybe even a royal guard. Not all of them are mages.\"<br/><br/>\"If they're not a mage, then I have no way of distinguishing them from every other civilian around our area!\" Melindra says. \"We shouldn't have let our guard down.

        "text": " \"That's why you'll always remain a trainee, Derek,\" the first man says. \"You're never going to become a full-time royal guard if you keep waiting for the captain to come and clean up your mess.\"<br/>When the three men get close enough for us to see what they look like, I realize that they are all wearing the same type of blue-colored uniforms as Gontrok and the other royal guards, except for the fact that their uniforms have much fewer markings on them, likely as a result of being only trainees. Each one of them is holding a different weapon in his hands, and each of their weapons has a different colored gem embedded into its hilt. <br/><br/>The man behind us has a trident with a brown topaz embedded into it, the man on the rooftop is holding a sword with a diamond in its hilt, and the man who made the wall of fire is wearing a metal glove decorated with a ruby. It doesn't take me long to realize that their weapons are in fact lessathi-made artifacts, and that these are the kinds of tools they are using to cast all of their spells.<br/><br/>\"None of them are mages...\" Melindra tells us in a low voice, while the three men are still talking amongst themselves. \"I could sense their auras from afar, but I had no idea that they were royal guard trainees... Kate, can you fight?\"<br/><br/>\"I... don't know...\" Kate says, as she's still struggling to get rid of her headache. \"But I'll have to try.\"<br/><br/> \"We have to find a place where we can calm down, so we can teleport back to our base,\" Breynan says, as we are now quickly moving through a large empty street with many alleyway entrances on its sides. \"For now, let's try to get as far away from here as possible.\"<br/>\"We still haven't figured out who cast the dizziness spell on Kate,\" Melindra says. \"As long as they are still around, we're not safe.\"<br/><br/>\"We don't need to be safe,\" Breynan says. \"We just need to be calm enough for the teleporter to be able to lock onto our auras.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" Melindra says. \"In that case, I could try to fly us all away from here, so we can--\"<br/><br/>\"No, we can't risk flying,\" Breynan says. \"The metal balls patrolling the skies will begin attacking us as soon as you do that. Their orders are to prioritize aerial targets above all else.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, we can't risk a fight with the guards either!\" Melindra says. \"Kate is still unable to concentrate on her spells, I can't attack any of the locals, and Barry's stat device is not working. Do you seriously think that you and Leila will be able to hold off the royal guards all by yourselves?\"<br/><br/>\"As long as we can get far enough away from here, there will be no need for a fight,\" Breynan says. \"We just need to reach the end of this street, and then we can--\"<br/><br/> \"Watch out!\" Melindra shouts and then she quickly pulls Breynan back, with both her hands.<br/>There is a sudden blast of fire coming from one of the alleys on the side of the street, and then the whole area in front of us gets immediately engulfed in flames. The large wall of fire that now blocks our path is apparently only inches away from Breynan's face. Had Melindra not pulled him away in time, he would have likely been completely incinerated.<br/><br/>\"You missed,\" I hear a man's voice, as he is making his way out of an alley behind us. \"I can't believe you actually missed. Could you not wait for another second until you cast that spell?\"<br/><br/>\"It's not my damn fault,\" I hear another man's voice, coming from the alley where the wall of fire originated from. \"That wench stopped them right before they were about to enter my line of sight. It doesn't matter, though. They've got a huge wall of fire in front of them now. They're not going anywhere.\"<br/><br/>\"I told you both that engaging them by ourselves would be a stupid idea,\" says another man, who is apparently situated on the rooftop of a weirdly shaped building on the side of the street. \"We are only trainees. We should have waited for the real royal guards to come and back us up.\"<br/><br/>",

Before she gets the time to react, a huge fist made of stone suddenly comes out of the ground and it punches Leila so hard that it sends her flying on her back, causing her to hit her head on the pavement and to lose her consciousness.<br/>\"Did you really think I was so stupid as to not realize that those manticores were illusions?\" the man with the trident says as he removes his weapon from the ground, while the large stone fist crumbles into pieces like the wall from before. \"I was just waiting for one of you to be dumb enough to enter the range of my rock fist attack. Say goodbye to your friend.\"<br/><br/>He then tries to advance towards Leila, but he hits what appears to be an invisible barrier, which is blocking his path.<br/><br/>\"What the hell?...\" the man with the trident says, as he is placing his hands on the barrier, trying to see how far it stretches.<br/><br/>While the royal guard trainee is still trying to get around the invisible wall, I suddenly feel Melindra's air currents flowing all around my body.<br/><br/>\"Bring her back here!\" Melindra tells me as she is pointing towards Leila, who is still lying unconscious on the ground. \"Quick! I can't hold this wind barrier for much longer.\"<br/><br/> \"I didn't spend two whole years mastering this weapon just so I could act as a glorified lookout,\" the first man says. \"Today, I'm going to show all of the royal guards what I am capable of, and you two are going to help me!\"<br/>\"Not like we have much of a choice at this point,\" Derek says. \"Let's get this over with.\"<br/><br/>\"Get ready!\" Breynan tells us.<br/><br/>Kate does not wait for the men to attack, and she sends several icicles towards the guy behind us. The trainee quickly thrusts his trident into the ground, and a wall of rock raises itself from the pavement in front of him, blocking all of the projectiles that were about to hit him. The man then raises his trident from the ground, and the wall crumbles to pieces. <br/><br/>At the same time, the man on the rooftop raises his sword, and he begins to slowly lift himself in the air, while the man in front of us points his glove in our direction, and a beam of fire comes out of it, heading straight for our group.<br/><br/>Kate immediately makes a wall of ice in front of us which shields us from the flames, but as soon as the fire is gone, the wall quickly disappears and Kate puts her hand on her forehead, trying once again to suppress the effects of her headache. All of a sudden, Breynan hits the ground with his staff, and a very bright white light fills the area next to us. When the light disappears, we see that three manticores have now appeared out of nowhere and that they are already taking to the air, each of them heading for a different target.<br/><br/> \"Damn it!\" the man with the trident says, as he sees one of the winged lions quickly approaching him. \"I didn't know they had a summoner!\"<br/>\"Take down the summons!\" Derek, the man with the sword says, in a panicky voice, when he sees one of the manticores flying towards him. \"Quick! I can't outmaneuver a manticore while I'm in the air.\"<br/><br/>\"Then get back on the ground and fight it!\" the man with the trident says, as he is trying to shoot down the manticore closest to him with rock projectiles. \"I already have my hands full, here!\"<br/><br/>The man with the metal glove does not say anything, but he is constantly sending blasts of fire towards the manticore above him, even though he can't seem to hit it even once.<br/><br/>\"I'll try to take one of them down while they're distracted,\" Leila writes, and then she rushes towards the man with the trident.<br/><br/>\"No, wait!\" Melindra shouts, but Leila doesn't hear her, and she keeps pressing forward.<br/><br/>",

I decide to take her advice and to get back to a lower altitude before any more 'droons' have the time to spot me.

The serpents each have a length of at least one hundred feet, a width of about six feet, and they have a ferocious look about them that makes it seem as if they were thirsting for blood.<br/><br/>\"Dear gods...\" the man with the trident says. \"Retreat! Retreat right now or we're done for, do you understand me?\"<br/><br/>\"Aaaaaah!\" Derek screams, as he flies in the opposite direction from the serpents, as fast as he can. \"They're going to catch up to us! They're going to--\"<br/><br/>Derek does not get to finish his sentence, because he is swallowed up by one of the water serpents, which then carries him far away from the battlefield. Soon afterwards, the same thing happens to both of the other royal guard trainees, who weren't fast enough to outrun the giant snake-like creatures and got swept away by the water as well. <br/><br/>",

You didn't want any of them to get away, did you?\"<br/><br/>\"Fine, fine,\" Melindra says. \"You made your point.\"<br/><br/>\"I don't understand...\" Kate says. \"Illuna, how did you find us?\"<br/><br/> \"I've been following you all from a distance, since before you even teleported here,\" Illuna says. \"Melindra likely sensed my presence from the beginning, but she was gracious enough to not give away my position.

We are not.\"<br/>\"Good,\" Illuna says. \"I detest small talk.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid that we'll have to interrupt our chat for now,\" Melindra says. \"I can sense the captain of the royal guard and that mercenary heading our way, and a few other mages as well. It won't be long until they reach us. Breynan, do you think we should be able to teleport back, now?\"<br/><br/>\"We're probably still going to need to wait a little, but I'll call Barry, so he can get the teleporter ready,\" Breynan says, as he pulls out his transceiver.<br/><br/>\"Were those three all of the enemies in your area?\" Illuna asks.<br/><br/>\"There was one other mage who cast a dizziness spell on Kate, but we can't tell where he is,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"He is likely hiding in one of the buildings on the side of the street,\" Melindra says. \"These houses are full of civilians, so there's no way for me to figure out who our attacker is, given that he's not a mage.\"<br/><br/>",

Illuna notices him in the last second and she manages to avoid a fatal blow, but unfortunately this does not stop the man from running his dagger through her chest, as we're all witnessing the scene with horrified looks on our faces.<br/><br/>\"No!\" Kate shouts, as she shoots several icicles towards the man in black robes, forcing him to jump back. \"Get away from her!\"<br/><br/> Once the black-robed man removes his knife, Illuna falls to the ground and it seems as if she's about to faint, while a puddle of blood is slowly being formed on the pavement below her. As I take a better look at the man who attacked Illuna, I see that he is wearing quite a few rings on his fingers, with different-colored gemstones embedded into them. It looks like these rings are lessathi relics that are being used to cast various types of magic, because the man is now creating a sword out of thin air and sending it flying towards Kate.<br/>\"Breynan, heal her quick!\" Kate says in a desperate tone of voice, as she is trying to hold the man in black robes at bay, while suppressing her headache.<br/><br/>\"W-w-what's going on?\" the teleporter guy says through the transceiver, as Breynan rushes to heal Illuna.<br/><br/>\"Everyone listen to me!\" Melindra shouts all of a sudden, while Breynan is busy casting a healing spell on Illuna. \"We need to get out of here now! Gontrok is on his way here, and he's traveling at a ridiculous speed.

We don't have time.\"<br/><br/>\"Gontrok is almost here!\" Melindra says.<br/><br/> \"Alright!\" the teleporter guy shouts, in a panicky voice. \"I'll do it! But don't blame me for what happens!\"<br/>A bright white light begins to envelop us all, as our bodies are vibrating loudly. Just as we're about to get teleported, I catch a glimpse of Gontrok making his way towards us at a very high speed.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" I hear him shout, and then my body is transported away from the street that we were on.<br/><br/>Just like Breynan warned us, the feeling I'm getting right now is that of my whole body being torn to shreds. It takes all of my willpower to not lose my consciousness while being teleported, and once I finally reach my destination, the first thing I do is to vomit on the ground.<br/><br/>As I slowly recover, I take a quick look around, and I see that although we are in an underground cavern surrounded with seredium walls, there is no teleporter device in sight, and despite having explored the rebel base all day, this tunnel does not seem familiar to me at all. As Breynan is still struggling to keep Illuna alive with one of his healing spells, I begin to finally understand what happened to us, and I ask everyone a question.<br/><br/>\"This...\" I say. \"This isn't anywhere near the underground rebel base, is it?\"<br/><br/>",
