I've gotten through every obstacle in my path so far. There's no reason why this should be any different. So there's no need to panic, okay? No reason. Just need to calm down. No panic. No panic...<br/><br/>While I'm busy thinking to myself, Daren is also slowly advancing towards me, only he seems to be unusually calm about all of this. Why is that? Is it because he knows he can beat me? No, no, that can't be the reason. Could it be that he already managed to figure a way out of this mess? What is he planning to do, exactly? Damn it, I'm sure that I could come up with a plan too, if only I could manage to calm down!<br/><br/>Once Daren and I both get to the center of the arena, facing each other, Daren gives me a wide grin, he drops his sword and shield on the ground, and then he throws his hands in the air.<br/><br/> \"I surrender!\" Daren shouts, as loud as he can. \"I cannot fight this man. How could I?\"<br/>\"This fight is to the death, healer,\" the announcer says. \"Even if this man is your friend--\"<br/><br/>\"I mean, look at those muscles!\" Daren shouts loudly, interrupting the announcer. \"No sane man would ever dare fight such a beast!\"<br/><br/>Suddenly all of the spectators in the crowd burst into laughter.<br/><br/>\"Those arms look like he could smash my head like a watermelon between his bare hands!\" Daren continues, with a mocking grin on his face. \"And look at the size of his back! May the gods have mercy on my soul!\"<br/><br/>Laugh it up, Daren... <br/><br/>Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. The idea to surrender was genius. Genius, and yet so obvious. How did I not think of this?<br/><br/>While the crowds are still laughing, the ambassador of Ollendor is making his way into the fighting area through one of the iron gates, and he is heading towards us.<br/><br/>\"What is the meaning of this?\" the ambassador shouts, and the crowds slowly fall silent. \"Why aren't you fighting? This is a fight to the death! You can't just surrender!\"<br/><br/> \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" Daren tells him, with a smirk, when he reaches us.<br/>The ambassador's face turns red with rage, and then he looks towards me.<br/><br/>\"You there!\" he says. \"Peasant! Your opponent is disarmed. Finish him off now, or face the consequences!\"<br/><br/>",

By the time he finished his monologue, most of the spectators had picked up the booing, and they were getting louder by the second.<br/><br/>\"Off with the ambassador's head!\" shouts one of the spectators, loudly enough for everyone to hear him.<br/><br/>This one phrase seemed to have perfectly resonated with what everyone was thinking at that moment, because all the spectators in the crowd gradually picked it up and made a shorter version of it, in order to be able to chant it in unison, repeatedly.<br/><br/>\"Off with his head! Off with his head! Off with his head!\" the crowds keep chanting, as the ambassador's arrogant look on his face slowly gets replaced with a much darker and more fearful expression, while a trickle of sweat begins to run down his forehead.<br/><br/> \"How does it feel, ambassador?\" we suddenly hear Eiden's voice, coming from somewhere behind the ambassador, although the stillwater himself is nowhere to be seen.<br/>\"Damn it, not again!\" Daren says, as soon as he hears Eiden's voice.<br/><br/>\"Is that...

Do you think that they would care about your high rank if you met them now on the street? Do you think that they would hesitate to kill you, even for a moment, if they were given the chance to do so?\"<br/><br/>He pauses.<br/><br/>\"These are the people that you've shunned all of your life, ambassador,\" Eiden continues. \"And you have done so due to your strict adherence to the belief that all of the people below your social rank were nothing but inferior creatures, unworthy of your attention.

These two gladiators have now become undesirables. If they survive the final round, then they will be set free, as promised. You may continue the rest of the round as you see fit.\"<br/><br/>He then storms out of the fighting area, and as far away from the booing noises as his legs can carry him. In the meantime, Daren has picked up his sword and shield from the ground, and he is now looking towards the place where we've heard Eiden's voice coming from.<br/><br/>\"So, how's it going, Eiden?\" Daren says. \"Are you enjoying the show?\"<br/><br/>The empty place that Daren is addressing gives him no answer.<br/><br/>\"You know, I was thinking...\" Daren says, ignoring the fact that Eiden never answered his question. \"While I was travelling, I've often heard of these new types of circuses, where they involve their audience directly in some parts of their shows. I was thinking that since you're such a loyal spectator, maybe we could try some of that! What do you think?\"<br/><br/> Daren pauses for a bit, as if he were actually waiting for Eiden to say something.<br/>\"Great!\" Daren says. \"Here goes!\"<br/><br/>He then throws his sword with breathtaking speed, right at the spot where Eiden was standing invisibly a few minutes prior. The sword passes through the empty space where the stillwater had been standing, and it falls on the ground, a few dozen feet beyond that position. Looking a bit disappointed, Daren lets out a small sigh, and he goes to retrieve his sword. <br/>  <br/>Not long after the departure of the ambassador, the announcer officially ends the fight between me and Daren, and he declares me as the victor of the battle, due to Daren's surrender. As I am preparing to return to my division room, the announcer stops me, telling me that I was scheduled to fight to the death with a gladiator from the sixth division right after my battle with Daren.

As the man enters the fighting area, I recognize him as being one of the more proficient fighters in his group. Actually, I'd even go as far as saying that he is comparable in terms of combat prowess to the fighters from the first division. His build is also quite impressive, being as tall as Daren and as bulky as Bruce. Just like most of the other gladiators, he seems to be wearing leather armor, but instead of a sword, his weapon of choice appears to be a large double-edged battle-axe, which he is now holding in both hands.<br/><br/>The beginning of the fight will likely be announced as soon as he reaches me. Now, then... How do I go about this? The fight is to the death, but as an undesirable, I am no longer bound by such rules.

No goals? What is it going to take to make you fight them? What is it going to take? Tell me, you miserable excuses for human beings! What do you want? Tell me! Tell--\"<br/><br/>The ambassador's last words get drowned out by a few very loud horns that seem to all be blowing in unison from different sides of the city. The crowds are starting to panic. It seems that they all know something we don't.

The show is cancelled. I repeat. The show is cancelled!\"<br/>The spectators are now rushing in droves towards the exits of the coliseum, and while they are not looking very calm and orderly to me, they are at least not knocking each other down, so they still have some sense of self-control left in them, despite their panic.<br/><br/>Now that he's done with the spectators, the announcer turns towards us.<br/><br/>\"Gladiators,\" he says. \"I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to temporarily join the forces of our army until our current crisis gets averted.

I took over his body. Or at least I tried to. We ended up having to share it, eventually. But seriously, though, what did you think would happen? You had to ally yourself with all of those lessathi and mages just to stand a chance against me, and you thought that your half-assed seal would hold me there forever? Don't make me laugh! The only reason why you even managed to beat me was because I'd only just gotten myself banned from the magical plane, and I didn't really know the ins and outs of this world at the time. If we had a rematch now, I'd obliterate you.\"<br/><br/>\"You would obliterate me from inside your amulet?\" Tyrath says.<br/><br/>\"Hey, you break this amulet for me, and we can have that rematch right now, if you want,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"You can stay there and rot,\" Tyrath says. \"I didn't come here for you.

Flower, who is now high up in the sky, some two hundred feet away from the dragon, makes a victory gesture with her right fist, as soon as she sees the explosions.<br/><br/> \"Nice job distracting him, Barry!\" Flower says, as she gives me a thumbs up, while still floating in the sky, with the aid of the fire jets coming from her feet. <br/>\"Watch out!\" I shout at her. \"The dragon is immune to fire!\"<br/><br/>\"Even if he is immune to fire,\" Illuna says, \"the impact from the explosions is still going to leave a mark.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, you heard her!\" Flower says, with a smirk. \"One more fireball, coming up!\"<br/><br/>The girl then creates a spinning ball of fire between her hands, and she sends it flying towards the dragon, making it explode on impact.<br/><br/>\"So this is the dragon that you guys were talking about,\" Hadrik says, with half a grin, and with a look of both excitement and apprehension in his eyes. \"Let's see what he's made of, then!\"<br/><br/>Hadrik then turns into a giant eagle, and he soars into the sky, towards the dragon. Flower makes sure to stop her fireballs when she sees him, and as soon as Hadrik positions himself above Tyrath, he turns back into his usual dwarf form, making a dive towards the dragon and punching him in the back. Hadrik's punch was so strong that we heard it from all the way down here, and it sent the dragon flying a dozen feet towards the ground. The dwarf then turns back into an eagle, and he flies away, waiting to see what his opponent will do next.<br/><br/>",

But it doesn't matter, because I've come now to put you in your place. Now stop talking, and activate your magic stats again so I can prove to you how weak you truly are!\"<br/><br/>\"Uh, you see...\" I tell the dragon. \"The thing is that I can't really activate those stats anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"So, you refuse to fight me at your full power, then?\" Tyrath says.<br/><br/>\"No, you don't understand,\" I say. \"I'm saying that I really can't use those stats right now. Couldn't you come back later, after I've learned how to activate them?\" <br/><br/>\"If you're not planning to activate the stats,\" the dragon says, \"then I'm going to start by slowly murdering all of your friends, one by one, until you finally come to your senses. And once I'm done with you, I will destroy this entire city, and then I will burn all the other human settlements from this continent to the ground. I will do today what I should have done ten thousand years ago. Your race was never meant to get out of the caves.\"<br/><br/>Immediately after he finishes his speech, a very large explosion envelops the dragon, and then a few smaller explosions start to fill the area around him. Flower, who is now high up in the sky, some two hundred feet away from the dragon, makes a victory gesture with her right fist, as soon as she sees the explosions.<br/><br/> \"Nice job distracting him, Barry!\" Flower says, as she gives me a thumbs up, while still floating in the sky, with the aid of the fire jets coming from her feet. <br/>\"Watch out!\" I shout at her. \"The dragon is immune to fire!\"<br/><br/>\"Even if he is immune to fire,\" Illuna says, \"the impact from the explosions is still going to leave a mark.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, you heard her!\" Flower says, with a smirk. \"One more fireball, coming up!\"<br/><br/>The girl then creates a spinning ball of fire between her hands, and she sends it flying towards the dragon, making it explode on impact.<br/><br/>\"So this is the dragon that you guys were talking about,\" Hadrik says, with half a grin, and with a look of both excitement and apprehension in his eyes. \"Let's see what he's made of, then!\"<br/><br/>Hadrik then turns into a giant eagle, and he soars into the sky, towards the dragon. Flower makes sure to stop her fireballs when she sees him, and as soon as Hadrik positions himself above Tyrath, he turns back into his usual dwarf form, making a dive towards the dragon and punching him in the back. Hadrik's punch was so strong that we heard it from all the way down here, and it sent the dragon flying a dozen feet towards the ground. The dwarf then turns back into an eagle, and he flies away, waiting to see what his opponent will do next.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " The dragon looks furious. It seems that he's planning to go all out from the start, this time around. Before Flower gets to cast a new fireball, the dragon disappears from where he was previously, and he reappears right in front of her, slashing at her with one of his claws. Flower reacts immediately, and she uses a jet of fire from her left hand to push her to the side, and out of the dragon's reach. Tyrath wastes no time, and he teleports again, right behind Flower. This time, it is Illuna who quickly turns around, and she uses two water jets from her hands to attack the dragon and also to push herself away from him at the same time. While the girl and the dragon repeat the same motions a few more times, Kate is preparing a very large cone of ice in the air above her, getting ready to send it flying towards Tyrath.<br/>\"Kate, this isn't going to work,\" Daren tells her, as he sees her preparing her ice cone. \"Don't you remember how things went the last time we've fought him? Your ice cones didn't affect him at all. If you could use one of your ice platforms to fly me all the way into the sky, maybe I could manage to hurt him with my sword.\"<br/><br/>\"This won't be like the last time,\" Kate says, with a determined look on her face. \"Now that I know the full extent of my enemy's power, I no longer have the luxury to worry about conserving my magical energy. This time, I'm going to fight him with all I've got, even if I end up fainting from exhaustion.\"<br/><br/> \"Damn it, listen to me!\" Daren says, but Kate ignores him, and she surrounds herself in a cage made of ice that she then uses to lift her up in the sky, so she can get a better view of her target.<br/>The cone of ice that she's creating is definitely looking a lot different from anything she's ever made before. It looks as sharp and durable as elven steel, and it is simply radiating magical energy. It feels like the whole area around it is trembling from the magical power that is being pumped into that one ice cone, and once the creation process is complete, the cone starts turning by itself, following the dragon's movements. After Tyrath teleports a few more times in order to attack Flower, Hadrik finally catches up to him again, in his eagle form, and he turns into a dwarf once more, punching him right in the face.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " While the dragon gets briefly stunned by the dwarf's attack, Kate uses the opportunity to launch her ice cone at her target. There is an extremely powerful explosion of air behind the ice cone, as it gets sent straight into the dragon's chest at an incredible speed. The icicle penetrates Tyrath's tough hide, and he lets out a very loud roar, which almost makes everyone lose their consciousness, even while they are desperately trying to cover their ears. The dragon then yanks the ice cone out of his chest with his claw, and he teleports right next to Kate, who is now barely even able to stand on her feet, inside her floating ice cage, due to the dragon's roar from before. Just as the dragon is about to burn her alive with his fire breath, a golden cage appears out of nowhere, trapping him inside. This does not stop Tyrath from breathing his fire, but somehow, none of the flames manage to pass through the cage's bars, and they eventually die out by themselves.<br/>\"The fox's cage...\" Tyrath says.<br/><br/>He then turns around, looking straight at Illuna.<br/><br/>\"Is this your doing?\" he asks her.<br/><br/>\"I've had enough of your annoying teleporting,\" Illuna says. \"You are going to stay put for the next few minutes. Do you understand?\"<br/><br/>\"How is this going to help you in any way?\" Tyrath says. \"I may not be able to attack you from inside here, but neither can you. All you are doing is wasting time.\"<br/><br/>\"Not exactly,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/> Flower then starts to move around the dragon's cage with her fire jets, creating balls of fire with her hands, and then leaving them floating one by one, all around the cage. <br/>\"I'd like to see you handle all of these at once, king of dragons,\" Flower says, with a smirk.<br/><br/>The dragon scoffs, and he begins to cast a series of protection spells on himself, getting prepared for the moment when the cage disappears. Kate is now also creating as many of her newly designed ice cones as she can, although judging by the expression on her face, this process is definitely wearing her out much faster than her usual means of casting magic. I don't know if she can keep this up much longer.<br/><br/>Damn it, there has to be something I can do in this situation. Maybe I can find a way to get up there somehow.<br/><br/>",

In the meantime, some other people are pushing several flying machines into the arena's fighting area. The machines look similar to the flying contraptions built by gnomes, with a large propeller on top, a long tail in the back, and two wings that help with gliding through the air. The propeller is usually powered by a spell cast by an air elementalist, but aside from that, there is no further need for magic in order to help these machines fly.<br/>I used to know a gnome a few years ago who would keep making me do flight tests of his prototypes in exchange for the information I needed about mages. I remember one of those prototypes being so bad that the propeller actually stopped working while I was in mid-flight, and I had to glide all the way down. I still have nightmares about some of those flights even to this day.<br/><br/>One of the people that pushed the flying contraptions into the arena is now having an argument with a gnome, not very far from our position. As I look closer, I realize that the gnome is none other than king Golmyck.<br/><br/> \"What do you mean the pilots and the gunners aren't here, yet?\" Golmyck says. \"I specifically asked for three pilots and gunners to be ready and waiting in case any of the manticores went berserk! Where are they now?\"<br/>\"I apologize, your highness,\" says the man who helped push the machinery. \"The manticores were all killed in the first round, so the pilots and gunners went out for a drink. I tried to contact them through their transceivers, but they wouldn't answer...\"<br/><br/>\"Damnations!\" Golmyck says. \"I'd pilot one of these myself, but I still need someone to man the guns!\"<br/><br/>He then turns towards us.<br/><br/>\"You there, gladiators!\" he says. \"You're all in the army now, am I correct? Do any of you have any experience piloting aircraft? Or are you at least any good at aiming from a moving vehicle? I could use some help, here!\"<br/><br/>",

Tyrath pulls the cone out with his claw, and then he starts inhaling air to prepare his fire breath, but just as he does that, the whole air around his head gets replaced with water, and he breathes that in, instead. Realizing his mistake, the dragon immediately attempts to cough out the water from his lungs, but the water around his head does not disappear, so all he manages to do is breathe more water in with every cough.<br/>\"This is it,\" Golmyck says. \"This is our chance! See if you can fly us over the dragon while he's busy with the water, so I can drop the spinning rope on him.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" I say. \"I'll try.\"<br/><br/>The dragon is now moving up and down, shaking his head violently, in an attempt to get rid of all the water above his neck.<br/><br/>\"There's no use fighting it,\" Illuna tells the dragon, in a cold voice. \"That water won't go away. And you can't burn it with your flame breath either, as long as you can't get rid of all that water in your lungs. Stop struggling and accept your fate.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"How do you like drowning in mid-air, Tyrath? I'm the one who taught this technique to Illuna, you know. You were blowing all that hot air just now, but in the end it turns out you can't even defeat one of my disciples! I guess you were never a match for me after all. Aha- AHAHAHAHA!!!\"<br/><br/>",

He then quickly turns into an eagle again, and he flies away, while one of Kate's ice cones penetrates the dragon's chest. Tyrath pulls the cone out with his claw, and then he starts inhaling air to prepare his fire breath, but just as he does that, the whole air around his head gets replaced with water, and he breathes that in, instead. Realizing his mistake, the dragon immediately attempts to cough out the water from his lungs, but the water around his head does not disappear, so all he manages to do is breathe more water in with every cough.<br/>\"This is it,\" Golmyck says. \"This is our chance! I will try to fly us over the dragon while he's busy with the water. When I give you the signal, pull that lever on your right. It will drop the spinning rope from the cargo hold. Do you see the lever I'm talking about?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I see it,\" I say. \"I'll wait for your signal.\"<br/><br/>The dragon is now moving up and down, shaking his head violently, in an attempt to get rid of all the water above his neck.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_combat_technique || 0) >= 2) {%> \"There's no use fighting it,\" Illuna tells the dragon, in a cold voice. \"That water won't go away.

Stop struggling and accept your fate.\"<br/>\"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"How do you like drowning in mid-air, Tyrath? I'm the one who taught this technique to Illuna, you know. You were blowing all that hot air just now, but in the end it turns out you can't even defeat one of my disciples! I guess you were never a match for me after all. Aha- AHAHAHAHA!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_combat_technique || 0) < 2) {%> <br/>\"I'm about to attack Tyrath,\" I tell Golmyck. \"Get ready.\"<br/><br/>\"Understood,\" Golmyck says, as he grabs the control stick firmly in his hands.<br/><br/>I start aiming the turret by the handles, attempting to target the dragon's wings. Once I feel that I've got a clear shot at him, I press the trigger, and I shoot about half a dozen bullets towards my target.<br/><br/>Shooting a moving target with a mounted turret proves to be a little more difficult than I thought, and I end up completely missing half of my shots, while the other half hit the dragon in the chest, instead of his wings.<br/><br/>Tyrath screams in pain, and then he flies out of the way, in order to avoid being hit by more bullets. Before heading towards us, the dragon inhales a lot of air in his chest, preparing to breathe his fire at us. <br/><br/>Golmyck anticipates his attack, and he quickly pushes the control stick forward, to make us dive down, in order to evade the incoming flames. The fire breath misses us by a fair margin, but the dragon is already on our tail, and he is gaining on us.<br/><br/>I attempt to shoot at him again, but Tyrath adeptly dodges most of my bullets while in mid-air, by paying attention to the way I move the turret.

This does not fool the dragon, however, who immediately matches our trajectory, without falling behind. When he reaches us, Tyrath dives directly towards our cockpit, and he grabs me in his hind claws, crushing me between them, and killing me on the spot.<br/><br/><% } %>",

According to the pact, neither of the three of us are allowed to directly attack any of the other's followers. This is to avoid a fight breaking out between any of the three signing parties, because a fight between any two of us would have the potential of destroying the entire island before reaching its conclusion, and neither of us would want that. As such, any and all conflicts between the three of us are to be resolved indirectly through our followers, and not through any direct means, whatsoever.\"<br/><br/> \"Ridiculous,\" Tyrath says. \"That old pact has long ago lost its meaning. The only reason why we signed the pact in the first place was because our powers used to be comparable. That has no longer been the case for more than a hundred years. Ever since you left the continent, you've only grown weaker, and now you are but an empty shell of your former self. If you didn't always resort to petty tricks, I would have killed you a century ago. You are no longer a threat, stillwater, and therefore, our pact is now void.\"<br/>\"Is it?\" Eiden asks, with a wide smile. \"Well, let us declare a new pact, then!\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the air all around us starts to feel like it's weighing heavily on our shoulders, and the world itself seems like it is trembling. It's almost as if there was now an earthquake in the middle of the air, instead of the earth below, and the blue sky looks as if it is ready to crack any minute, under the pressure.
