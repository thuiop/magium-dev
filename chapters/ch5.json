Just a little parting gift from our mutual friend.\"<br/><br/>\"Eiden!\" says Daren, while clenching his fist.<br/><br/>He casts a healing spell on me and I suddenly get enveloped in a warm, soothing light. The pain leaves me completely, and I manage to get back on my feet with no difficulty. I always knew there were healing spells like this, but witnessing one of them first hand is something else.

Eiden got upset because Cutthroat Dave mistook him for me, and I took advantage of the situation.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah! Serves him right! But how did I end up unconscious on the ground?\"<br/><br/>\"You mean you don't remember? He just waved his hand casually and put you to sleep.\"<br/><br/>\"What?... That can't be right. I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness! And what was that about him using fire magic?

There's four of them, and they have the woman surrounded, but it doesn't seem like they've drawn blood yet.<br/><br/>When we finally get within visual range of the attackers, my suspicions get confirmed. They're goblins, alright. Vile and hideous creatures, not taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, crooked noses, pointy ears and green skin. Despite their appearances, goblins are quite intelligent and are usually organized in clans with clearly defined hierarchies, unlike most other monster races. They're also smart enough to make and use tools, as well as weapons and armor. <br/><br/>",

With the death of our grand priest, the number of sick people increases every day. He was the last person in our town that knew how to create food using magic, and as much as he has tried, he did not succeed in teaching his craft to any of his disciples.

There was a time when each city in Varathia had at least ten people that knew how to create food out of nothing, by using magic. That skill was taught to them by the Creator, and they taught it to their disciples, as well as they could. But those that could pick up the skill were very rare and talented individuals. Since the very foundation of Varathia six hundred years ago, all of the cities relied heavily on the Creator to find these talented individuals, and teach them this craft. But then, the Creator simply disappeared about a hundred years ago, and the number of people that still knew the food making craft started to dwindle.\"<br/><br/>\"With the risk of asking something obvious, who is the Creator?\" asks Daren.<br/>\"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot how little information about us reaches the other continents. The Creator was... the founder of our civilization. Everything we are today, we owe to him. He and the spirit protector of all animals, the great golden fox decided together six hundred years ago to end all war and hunger, uniting the human and animal kingdom, and leading them into an age of peace and prosperity. They taught both humans and animals how to create what they needed with magic, and thus eliminated the need for work and conflict. Food, water, warmth, shelter, every one of those things could be obtained through magical means. From what I hear, it must have been paradise.\"<br/><br/>",

Others say he simply got bored with us and went to create another civilization on a different continent. Most people, however, think he died, and that the kings of Varathia decided to hide this from the people in order to avoid creating panic.

The mage stops his strike mere inches away from his target, and his whole body starts vibrating loudly, as it gets enveloped in a white light.<br/><br/>\"Ah, shi--\" he starts to say, but he gets teleported out of the continent, and away from the tournament.   <br/><br/> \"What did you do to Clive, you filthy-- YYARGHH\"<br/><br/>The man who started to talk was immediately interrupted by one of Kate's cones of ice that went through his right shoulder.<br/><br/>\"Normally, I wouldn't think twice about killing scum like you,\" Kate says. \"But I'd rather spare Rose from witnessing a gruesome bloodbath. So I'm offering you a chance to retreat. What do you say?\"<br/><br/>The man with the ice cone in his right shoulder is grinding his teeth.<br/><br/>\"Forget the banshee,\" he says to his comrade. \"Let's get the hell out of here!\"<br/><br/>Once the two of them get far enough away, Kate turns to Rose and says:<br/><br/>\"I've changed my mind. I would be honored to serve as your escort until you reach your hometown. I'm sorry for having misjudged you. What you just did was very brave and heroic.\"<br/><br/>",
