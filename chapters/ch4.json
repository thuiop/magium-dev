Is this a survivor from our last battle, looking to avenge his fallen comrades?<br/><br/>When he gets within visual range of us, we discover that he is rather young for a warrior, and he isn't wearing any protective gear. He seems to be somewhere in his late teens, but no older than twenty, and he's wearing loose pants and a loose tunic, not much different from clothes one would normally change into before going to bed. The fact that he's walking with his eyes closed and his hands in his pockets is not really helping his case either. He looks like he just got out of bed to get a midnight snack, and definitely not like a participant in a life and death tournament. However, he can't be one of the locals either, since we would have been immediately notified to not harm him.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch4_objectives || 0) == 3) {%>\"Good morrow, lad!\" Daren shouts after the boy. \"Lovely day for a walk, isn't it? What business would you have with us? If you are lost, we'd be more than happy to give you directions!\" <br/>With Daren, it's hard to tell when he's being sarcastic or sincere, since there are no hints in his look or his tone of voice, and as I've known him so far he'd be capable of either of those things in this situation. Our young visitor doesn't seem to have taken offense at Daren's remark, and smiles politely with his eyes still closed.<br/><br/>\"There's no need,\" the boy answers. \"I was looking for some old friends of mine when I sensed there was a fellow stillwater nearby, so I just had to stop by and say hello. There's so few of us nowadays, that it would be a shame to not at least greet each other in passing! My name is Eiden. Pleased to meet you!\"<br/><br/>My whole body freezes for a second. An actual stillwater? Here? No... No. I should calm down. It's likely just some other guy who came up with the same idea as me. I refuse to fall for my own trick! <br/><br/>Seeing that I don't say anything, Daren replies in my stead.<br/><br/>\"Don't mind him! Barry's a little shy. I'm sure he's also pleased to make your acquaintance. My name's Daren.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh? Then you must be the healer in armor I've been hearing so much about! And it seems that you also have a third member in your party. A survivor of the Beacon of Hope, no less. I did not know any of them were still alive.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Your lives for a message.\"<br/><br/>He stops for a bit to think, before he continues.<br/><br/>\"The friends I'm looking for always wear dark blue robes, and on their chests they should have brooches that picture a hawk holding the sun in its talons.

Eiden dodges effortlessly, and Daren quickly goes for a second strike, this time meant to cut him in half. Eiden steps casually to the side, making it look like child's play. After a few more wasted strikes on Daren's part, just when it looked as though he might have caught the stillwater on the wrong foot, Eiden simply put his bare hand in front of his face, and stopped the full blow of the sword with only his index finger.<br/><br/>\"No...\" Daren says, as if he couldn't believe his eyes.<br/><br/> \"I tire of this,\" says Eiden as he makes a gesture with his other hand.<br/>In less than a second, Daren dropped to the ground like a log, his armor making a loud clank as it hit the rocky soil below.<br/><br/>\"No!\" I shout.<br/><br/>\"I only put him to sleep,\" the stillwater says. \"He'll wake up in a few minutes.\"<br/><br/>He turns to leave.<br/><br/>\"Oh, and don't worry about looking for my friends. I'm sure you'll be meeting them soon enough.\"<br/><br/>He smiles again, and then he heads towards the woods.<br/><br/>",

        "text": "\"Daren, can you hear me? Wake up!\"<br/>There's no answer. Just what kind of spell did this guy use? I'm pretty sure that Daren has some really strong spells protecting him at all times. Standard sleep spells should be no more than a moderate inconvenience for him.<br/><br/>While I try to wake Daren up, I suddenly hear a very familiar voice coming from the direction in which Eiden disappeared.<br/><br/>\"Stillwater!\"<br/><br/>That's Cutthroat Dave's voice. No doubt about it. I'd recognize that hoarse voice and that thuggish accent anywhere. <br/><br/>I turn around towards where the voice came from, but there's only trees. Why would Cutthroat Dave shout for me before even getting the chance to get a clear shot of my face?<br/><br/>Then it hit me. He never got to see my face. I was hiding behind a tree the whole time. I rush towards the woods to confirm my suspicions. I hide behind one of the trees and take a peek. <br/><br/>Just as I thought, Cutthroat Dave has mistaken Eiden for me, and he's looking for revenge. He's managed to assemble a team in the short time we were apart, and they all have the stillwater surrounded. The sad part is that Dave looks like a well-bred gentleman compared to his new colleagues. Some of them look and smell like they haven't washed for months. I guess birds of a feather really do flock together.<br/><br/>\"I've been looking for you, stillwater,\" Dave says. \"I've been tracking your footsteps since yesterday. I told you we'd meet again. No one can run or hide from Cutthroat Dave.\"<br/>\"I'm afraid you are mistaken, my good man,\" says Eiden, smiling. \"I am quite sure I've never seen you before in my life.\"<br/><br/>\"Aye. I am sure of that too. You'd have needed to open your eyes in order to see me.\"<br/><br/>All of Cutthroat Dave's men suddenly burst into laughter at the same time. They're laughing loudly and vulgarly, probably in an attempt to intimidate their victim, just like a group of school bullies. Eiden's expression does not change, and he continues to smile pleasantly.<br/><br/>\"Don't think you can fool me by changing your voice a little. I'm too smart for that. I'd recognize that arrogant tone of yours anywhere. Where's your healer friend? Did he leave you here to rot after you saved his skin?\"<br/><br/>\"Are you perhaps speaking of the healer in armor? If that's the case, then he's right there, past these trees.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah! Nice try, stillwater. That intimidating trick of yours ain't gonna work on me twice in a row.\"<br/><br/>He turns towards his esteemed colleagues.<br/><br/> \"Men! Ready your swords. Pull out your knives. This is what we came here for. Today, we write our names in history. Today, we become LEGENDS!\"<br/>Cutthroat Dave's men all give out a roar as they raise their hands holding their weapons in the air. Eiden's smile has widened. His expression is similar to what it was before he smashed Daren into the ground. He's enjoying this. They're going to get massacred.<br/><br/>",

And if I defeat him and then leave him alive, he'll just go on a rampage and kill innocent people. A few more dead thugs in the world won't make any difference. I very much doubt that anyone's going to mourn their passing.<br/>I decide to not intervene, and let the battle run its course.<br/><br/>Cutthroat Dave initiates by sending a few flying knives towards the stillwater. Just as they reach Eiden, they all stop in mid air in front of him. Eiden smirks and he points towards the cutthroat. All of the knives unconditionally obey their new master, and head towards Dave at breathtaking speed. He manages to parry them in the nick of time with his own flying knives, but he looks dumbstruck.<br/><br/>\"What kind of sorcery is this?\" he says.<br/><br/>\"The magic kind, of course,\" the stillwater answers him. \"See, this is a tournament for mages. Circus auditions were being held across the street.\"<br/><br/>Dave's face contorts into a snarl.<br/><br/>\"We'll see how funny you are with some holes in your skull, you cheeky bastard. Men, teach this little upstart a lesson.\"<br/><br/>All of Cutthroat Dave's men jump at Eiden, but he disappears right from under their nose and appears in front of Dave with a grin on his face, though his eyes remain shut.<br/><br/>\"Sending your men to do your dirty work, Dave? I thought you were going to become a legend! Why are you hesitating?\"<br/>Dave pulls out a knife from his belt and slashes for Eiden's neck.<br/><br/>\"Shut your smart-arse mouth and die, you little shi--\"<br/><br/>Before the thug got to finish his sentence, Eiden put his palm on Dave's face, and made his head explode in a thousand pieces. Cutthroat Dave's life had ended just like that, without even having the time to realize he was dead. <br/><br/>Blinded by rage, Dave's loyal followers rushed screaming towards Eiden, with their weapons at the ready. They didn't get too far, though. With a snap of his fingers, the stillwater made a huge pillar of fire appear in front of him, which incinerated all of the thugs to a point where not even their bones were left intact. The fire completely ignored all of the trees around it, and Eiden simply put it out with another snap of his fingers.<br/><br/>I expected this to be quick. But this outcome far exceeded my expectations. He can even cast fire magic. Just what in the hell are we supposed to do to fight this guy?<br/><br/>Eiden turns towards me. I suddenly remember that he relies primarily on his magical sense and not on his eyesight in order to assess his surroundings. He must have sensed my presence ever since before the beginning of the battle.<br/><br/> \"Did you enjoy the show, Barry?\" he asks me. His smile is gone from his face.<br/>\"It was quite the spectacle,\" I reply to him.<br/><br/>\"That it was. It would appear the cutthroat had mistaken me for another stillwater. One who was associating with a healer. Quite an unfortunate misunderstanding. You wouldn't happen to know who they were looking for, would you Barry?\"<br/><br/>",

Once I arrive in front of him, Eiden answers his own question.<br/><br/>\"They were looking for you, Barry. You really have a lot of nerve lying to my face like that. Perhaps I was wrong about you. Perhaps I will deliver my message myself, after all.\"<br/><br/>\"No, wait, I can explain!\"<br/><br/>\"I have no further need of your services or your explanations, Barry. You are hereby relieved of duty.\"<br/><br/>Before giving me a chance to reply, he gestures with his hand once more, and my neck snaps, killing me instantly.<br/><br/>",

And you seemed to enjoy it well enough. Otherwise you would have simply cut down the tree I was hiding behind in order to reveal me to the cutthroats.\"<br/><br/>\"Fascinating. You really appear to have no sense of crisis. Allow me to help you in that regard.\"<br/><br/>As he finishes his sentence, I start feeling something pressing against my throat. It feels like an invisible rope is tied around my neck, and it is slowly lifting me above the ground. It's not just my imagination. I really am being lifted higher and higher above the ground. It's getting a lot harder to breathe as the invisible noose gets tighter around my neck. I try to take the noose off with my hands, but there's nothing there. If this goes on much longer I'm seriously going to die.<br/><br/>Once I get several feet above the ground, the invisible noose suddenly disappears, and I fall on the rocky soil, dropping to my knees. I could hear a loud crack as I hit the ground. I'm pretty sure that the fall broke both my kneecaps. The pain of it is excruciating.<br/><br/>\"Now that I have your attention,\" the stillwater continues, \"I want you to understand something. If you try something like that again, broken kneecaps are going to be the least of your worries. Are we clear?\"<br/>\"Crystal.\"<br/><br/>Eiden's smile comes back to his face.<br/><br/>\"That's what I like about you, Barry. Even in the face of utter annihilation, you manage to maintain your defiant, sarcastic tone. But you are neither strong nor brave. So what is it, then? What is the driving force that propels you forward?\"<br/><br/>\"Stupidity.\"<br/><br/>\"Well said!\" Eiden says, smiling. \"I think your healer should have woken up from his slumber by now. Go ahead and call him. I'm sure he's fixed more than a few broken kneecaps in his lifetime. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry.\"<br/><br/>With these last words he turns his back to me, and heads deeper into the woods.<br/><br/>",

He seizes the opportunity and quickly pulls out a teleportation scroll out of his pocket. Before anyone of us has the time to react, he casts the spell, and pops out without a trace.<br/><br/>Where in the hell did that lowlife get a teleportation scroll from? I've been searching one for months and came up empty. Not to mention that even a single one of those scrolls costs a fortune.<br/><br/>\"Now look at what happened!\" Kate says, furious. \"He got away.

I would have expected no less from a survivor of the Beacon of Hope!\"<br/><br/>\"You!\" Daren shouts, and he rushes towards the stillwater.<br/><br/>Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.<br/><br/>\"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous,\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>Kate eyes the stillwater suspiciously.<br/><br/>\"Why didn't you do it?\" she asks him.<br/><br/>\"Pardon?\"<br/><br/>\"Why didn't you kill him?

So I'll ask you this, instead. How do you know about the Beacon of Hope?\"<br/><br/>\"Is this really the question you should be asking? Shouldn't the question here be why your friends don't know anything about the Beacon of Hope?\"<br/><br/>Kate looks at me again.

I'm pretty sure that Daren has some really strong spells protecting him at all times. Standard sleep spells should be no more than a moderate inconvenience for him.<br/><br/>While I try to wake Daren up, I suddenly hear a very familiar voice coming from the direction in which Eiden disappeared.<br/><br/>\"Stillwater!\"<br/><br/>That's Cutthroat Dave's voice. No doubt about it. I'd recognize that hoarse voice and that thuggish accent anywhere. <br/><br/>I turn around towards where the voice came from and see that aside from a familiar face, there are also about a dozen other unfamiliar faces lined up in front of me.<br/><br/>It would appear Dave has managed to assemble a team in the short time we were apart. The sad part is that Dave looks like a well-bred gentleman compared to his new colleagues. Some of them look and smell like they haven't washed for months. I guess birds of a feather really do flock together.<br/><br/>\"I've been looking for you, stillwater,\" Dave says. \"I've been tracking your footsteps since yesterday. I told you we'd meet again.

He seems to have finished dealing with Cutthroat Dave's henchmen and is now rushing towards the stillwater with his sword in hand.<br/><br/>Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.<br/><br/>\"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous,\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>He turns his gaze back to me.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_strength || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_agility || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_reflexes || 0) < 3) {%> \"Tell me, what kind of a mailman dies before setting foot out of the post office?

You caught me off guard. It won't happen again.\"<br/><br/>Cutthroat Dave then pulls out a scroll of teleportation from his pocket, and quickly uses it to make himself scarce, to the shock and dismay of his loyal followers.<br/><br/>Where in the hell did that lowlife get a teleportation scroll from? I've been searching one for months and came up empty. Not to mention that even a single one of those scrolls costs a fortune.<br/><br/> \"DAMN, Barry!\" Daren says. \"You sure don't pull your punches.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, I did. And it cost me. But I'm not done, yet.\"<br/><br/>I pick up some pebbles from the ground, and use all of the strength in my right arm to throw them towards Dave's henchmen. Seven of them got seriously wounded and are now screaming, scared. <br/><br/>\"Did you see that?!\" one of them says. \"All he did was throw some pebbles he picked up from the ground.\"<br/><br/>\"He beat the boss too.

Looking to see what's making the sound, I see Eiden, leaning against a pine tree with his usual smile on his face.<br/><br/>\"Impressive, Barry,\" he says. \"You don't often see stat boosters used so efficiently these days!\"<br/><br/>You!!!\" Daren shouts, and he rushes towards the stillwater.<br/><br/>Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.<br/><br/>\"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous,\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>\"You know about stat boosters too?\" I ask the stillwater.<br/><br/>\"I do!
