        "text": "<br/>\"Alright, I think that's a wrap!\" says Daren once we finish our strategy meeting. <br/><br/>We're currently all sitting in a circle in front of our cave's entrance. The sun is pretty high up in the sky, and there's not a cloud in sight. Luckily, Kate has graciously agreed to use her ice magic to cool the air around us a bit. This way we can enjoy the weather without feeling as if we were inside an oven. <br/><br/>\"Noon is almost upon us,\" Daren continues. \"We should get going as soon as possible. We can't afford to keep travelling once the sun sets, and we have a long road ahead of us. Rose, did you get all of the herbs you were looking for?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, no... I just remembered, I dropped my bag of herbs when I was being chased by the goblins.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, I doubt anyone would have stolen it, so it must still be where you left it. I'll help you look for it! Come with me.\"<br/><br/>I get up to follow them, but Kate grabs me by the sleeve.<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" she says. \"There's something that's been bothering me since this morning.\"<br/>She looks really tense. It seems that she's struggling to get the words out of her mouth.<br/><br/>\"Were you...\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"Were you really smitten with me since you first saw me?\"<br/><br/>Of all the things I would have expected her to say to me right now, this was the last of them. Thanks a lot, Daren. What am I supposed to tell her, now?<br/><br/>",

When we first met yesterday, she looked very tense, and it seemed as though she was expecting us to try and kill her the moment she turns her back on us. Now she seems calmer, and she allows herself to smile a little more often, even if only faintly, especially when she's talking with Rose. <br/>Daren on the other hand has been a lot colder with me ever since he found out that I lied about my true intentions for coming here. We're still on speaking terms, but he's nowhere near as friendly as he was yesterday. I can only hope that he'll get over it by the end of our trip.<br/><br/>We've been keeping a steady pace so far, and there's been no breaks except for occasionally stopping to get some fruits from the trees, or to fill our gourds with water from a river.

As we travel, we start talking about various things: Daren's adventures, our lives before joining the tournament, the reasons we all came here. During our conversations, Daren was of course the one that's been speaking the most, while Kate has been as evasive as always about her past and her reasons for being here. Hearing our stories, Rose decides to join our discussion, by telling us a bit about herself.<br/>\"I've always liked plants,\" she tells us. \"Plants and books. So it's no surprise that I spent most of my youth with my nose buried in herbology manuals. As time passed, I started to learn more about herbal medicine, and I realized my talents could be used to help the people in need. Most people I help don't really have much money to repay me, but the little they give me is enough for me to make a living, and their sincere feelings of gratitude are much more rewarding to me than the money I'd get by only working for rich folk. I've been living a modest life along with my brother and sister who are nine and eight years old respectively, and ever since my father died last year, I've been occasionally getting some financial support from my ex husband.\"<br/><br/>\"You were married?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, for a few years, but it didn't really work out in the end. We've both moved on with our lives since then, and we've had no children together, so there were no hard feelings. Ever since my father died, I've had to take care of my siblings all by myself, so my main focus for the past year has been my work, and my family.\"<br/><br/>\"But what about your mother?\" says Kate.<br/><br/>\"She died long ago, when she gave birth to my little sister.\"<br/>\"Oh... I'm sorry.\"<br/><br/>Rose smiles.<br/><br/>\"There's no need, you couldn't have known.\"<br/><br/>\"So, how did you all handle the death of your grand priest?\" Daren asks, trying to change the subject. \"You said that he was the last person alive that could create food out of nothing in your city, so I imagine there must have been some backup plan in case of his inevitable death?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yes, many people have started to learn agriculture, but the problem is that most of the fertile terrain around our town is already owned by the nobles. By planting your seeds further away from the town, you run a great risk of getting your crops raided by monsters.\"<br/><br/>",

It's not just in our area, it happens throughout the entire continent. I'm not certain, but I think it all started when we lost contact with the animal kingdom. After the first animal hunts were started by the people of Olmnar several decades ago, the animals' leader, the spirit golden fox has ordered her subjects to stop speaking in our language. The monsters must have found out about this, and they took advantage of the fact that the humans and the animals were no longer working together in order to wreak havoc.\"<br/><br/>\"What about the gods?\" Daren asks. \"Are they not getting involved in any of this?\"<br/><br/>\"The only gods that are currently getting involved are the god of Fate and the god of Death, but I very much doubt that any of them have our best interests at heart. It is said that the two of them started working together recently, and that might well be true, judging by the high level of cooperation between their followers lately.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, isn't the god of Fate just a fancy title for the god of Illusions?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Rose answers. \"Most gods name themselves after the power their followers gain by worshipping them. Some of them, however choose other names for themselves, which can be a bit confusing. It's the same for the god of Death. Judging by his name, you would think that he reigns over the underworld, but in fact he is just a god of Necromancy, bringing the dead back to life to serve his bidding.\"<br/><br/>",

Most of the energy it's getting is from the powerful spells that have been cast all around us since the beginning of this tournament, and that energy would have just dissipated into thin air anyway, so you could just say I'm recycling it, rather than stealing it. I think that--\"<br/><br/>I get interrupted by a very loud roar that echoes all around us. <br/><br/>\"What was that?\" Rose asks, visibly scared.<br/><br/>A second, louder roar now booms through the air, as I can feel my hair stand up on the back of my neck. I've never heard this sound before in my life. I have no idea what beast might be causing it. So then what is this feeling of dread I'm getting all of a sudden? Why do I find myself wanting to run as fast as I can, in any direction, as long as it gets me as far away from this place as possible?<br/><br/>Shortly after the second roar ended, a very powerful wind started to blow towards us. I can almost feel it trying to lift me in the air. The trees are barely holding up, and it looks as if they could get pulled out of their roots at any moment. We're lucky that this happened while we were in a clearing, because otherwise we would have had to also protect ourselves from falling trees, while trying to hold our ground against the relentless force of the wind.<br/>As some of the trees start to fall, a monstrous figure makes its appearance high above us. It's at least fifty foot tall, with very tough looking red scales covering its entire body, and wings the size of sails on a longship. Its claws look as sharp as blades, and its fangs are bared at us menacingly, but its overall appearance is not much different from that of an overgrown lizard. <br/><br/>A dragon. They really existed. Is this all happening because of my disappointment for not encountering any mythical creatures so far? If that's the case, then I take it back. I take it all back, just, please, let this all be a dream. Let this all just be the end of a bad dream, before I wake up back in our cave, and then we can start our journey anew. <br/><br/>\"Get down!!!\" Daren shouts to us, as the dragon gets closer, and then lands a few dozen feet in front of us, making the whole ground tremble violently under its weight. <br/><br/>\"No...\" Rose says, unable to control her shivering, and barely able to keep her balance anymore. \"This can't be happening. This can't be happening...\"<br/><br/> The dragon looks all around us, as if it were trying to find something, and then it shouts loudly, in the common tongue:<br/>\"Where is he?!\"<br/><br/>Seeing that none of us are answering, the dragon asks us again, this time giving us a few more details.<br/><br/>\"The stillwater! Where is he?! You reek of his stench. Where are you hiding him?\"<br/><br/>",

It's amazing how natural this is feeling. It's as if I've been casting spells my entire life. Is this really the true power of my stat device?<br/>Just as I finish casting my spell, time unfreezes itself and the dragon's fire hits my magical barrier head on. The flames then  disperse into the air, while Kate looks around her, shocked at the discovery of the newly formed barrier protecting her.<br/><br/>\"Daren, did you...\"<br/><br/>\"No, it wasn't me. This barrier is leagues stronger than anything I could ever conjure. I don't know who did this.\"<br/><br/>\"You!\" the dragon Tyrath shouts from high above in the sky, while pointing at me. \"You did this! It does not matter. All you've managed to achieve is to make yourself my next target. Prepare to die!\"<br/><br/>I conjure another protective barrier around me and Rose just in time to defend us from the incoming flames. My barrier is holding up much better than Daren's. There's no sign of it breaking any time soon, and I'm barely even feeling the heat outside of it. <br/>The question is, what am I going to do now? Looking at my device, I can see that my stats have remained exactly the same and I have no extra available points, so then what did Eiden do to it? I'll need to figure this out later. <br/><br/>At any rate, judging by the amount of extra energy I can sense in the stat device and the speed at which it's getting consumed, I'd say that the estimate Eiden gave me is spot on. I have less than five minutes to finish this fight, but even with all this magical power, the dragon may well pulverize me in a one on one fight if I don't do this right. Both Daren and Kate are too exhausted to assist me, so I'm on my own for the time being.  Even as I'm standing here thinking, time is running out, but can I afford to just start fighting without any plan whatsoever?<br/><br/>",

That disoriented me a bit, so it took me a few seconds to figure out where the dragon went. Once I locate him, I send a powerful jet of water in his direction.

        "text": "Going in without a plan would be suicidal. I'll just have to use this time as efficiently as I can. First of all, I need to think about my defenses. I now have access to dozens of powerful protection spells, but it would take me three minutes to cast all of them. <br/>Even if I use the time freezing spell Eiden cast just now, that would still only save me about two minutes, and I'll become unable to use the spell for the remainder of the battle. Then again, the time stopping spell isn't really suited for combat, since the spell breaks as soon as I move a few feet or interact with anyone who's frozen, so this may well be the best time to use it. Or maybe I should try to limit casting to only what is absolutely necessary?<br/><br/>Let's see... The one thing I'll need the most is protection from fire. I can't just spend my whole fight trapped inside this barrier, and this spell will grant me some immunity from flames. It'll still feel like I'm in an oven, but at least I won't be burnt to a crisp. <br/><br/>Aside from that, judging by how I've seen the dragon fight so far, I think I could also use some protection from physical damage, to defend me from his claw attacks. It won't be enough to stop him from killing me if he lands a strike, but maybe it'll help me deflect some of his hits.  <br/><br/>The strong wind he can generate with his wings might also be a problem. It felt like I was trying to fight a hurricane when the dragon first made his appearance, so I guess I could also use some spells that give me protection from wind.<br/>Other than that, it's anyone's guess. It is said that some of the older dragons can cast magic, but I do not know if Tyrath is one of them. More than that, I have no way of knowing which kind of magic he'd be specialized in.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to decide which protection spells I cast in the limited time I have at my disposal.<br/><br/>",

        "text": "The dragon sees that his fire breath isn't working, so he tries to dive in again. My barrier is too strong to be broken as easily as Daren's though, so he'll be busy for a while.<br/>Now that I've established my defensive strategy, I need to think about the offensive. With the spells I have access to now, I have almost limitless choices, but I'll have to think of a tactic that can defeat Tyrath in the few minutes I have left.<br/><br/>I'm going to definitely need to cast a flight spell on myself, since it will be too difficult to engage the dragon otherwise. <br/><br/>The thing I'm lacking the most here is information about my enemy. All I have to go on are legends and fairy tales, and I'm not sure how much I can rely on any of them in this situation. One thing that most legends agree on is that dragons have a high elemental resistance to fire and that they are immune to mind affecting spells and illusions. Other than that, I have no idea which spells would work best.<br/><br/>I already know that Kate's ice didn't really hurt the dragon, but maybe water would be a better choice? Water is after all the opposing element to fire. Actually, forget water, if I am to try elemental magic I may as well try them all, except fire of course.<br/><br/>Daren's sword seemed to at least be able to get through the dragon's tough scales but I do not know what enchantments he has on it. Maybe I could persuade him to give me his sword for the duration of this battle, and then I can fight Tyrath head on? The downside to this plan is that I don't seem to have a strength enhancing spell in my repertoire, so the power of my swing would depend entirely on my strength stat.<br/><br/>Shapeshifting magic is pretty useless in this situation, because of two main reasons. First of all, these spells cannot be used to transform into something much bigger than my actual size, so it's not like I can just turn into a dragon and fight Tyrath on equal footing. Secondly, you cannot cast spells while shapeshifted, so my mobility would be greatly reduced because I couldn't teleport. It's just not worth it any way I look at it.<br/>Using summoning magic is out of the question as well, since none of these spells were designed to fight an enemy of this caliber. The most any of the summoned creatures could do is moderately inconvenience Tyrath or provide a distraction.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm thinking in too small of a scale, though. With the powers I have at my disposal right now, I could be doing a lot more damage. I could literally make a tornado out of thin air, or use earth magic to animate a rock giant that would dwarf the dragon and who could smash him between its hands. I could also make a blizzard, a lightning storm, a rain of acid and even a rain of meteorites. <br/><br/>The problem with all of these big spells is that it's almost impossible to prevent collateral damage, so I'd be forced to cast a lot of protections on Daren, Kate, Rose and even myself  beforehand to make sure we're all safe, which would take me about a minute. The time freezing spell wouldn't save me much time in this case, since we're relatively far apart from each other, and moving would cancel the time stopping effect.<br/><br/>Half a minute of my time is already up. I'll need to decide fast.<br/><br/>",

Instinctively, I hold the sword in front of me to defend from his attack. To my surprise, I see that the sword actually absorbs all of the dragon's flames into it, and it is now radiating magical power, looking as though it has been set ablaze.<br/><br/>Daren's sword could do something like this? What kind of crazy enchantments are on this thing anyway? Does this mean I can actually now use the dragon's flames as my own?<br/><br/>I slash my sword towards the dragon, which sends all of his flames back towards him, concentrated in one powerful beam.<br/><br/>It worked! I can't believe it! Let me try and see if it can also absorb other magical elements. I concentrate my magical power on the sword in the form of lightning. I can feel the sword charge up and as I finish my spell, I can actually see the electrical current surging through it.<br/><br/>As Tyrath flies towards me, I swing my sword at him, which unleashes a powerful lightning attack that hits him head on. That doesn't affect the dragon in the slightest and when he reaches me, he attacks me with his claws again. <br/>I teleport out of his range, and try to think fast of what my next move should be. Fire doesn't work, lightning doesn't work, ice doesn't work either and I don't see how powering this sword with air, water or earth would do any good. That only leaves acid as an option, but the question is, will the acid get absorbed into the sword like all the other elements, or will it completely melt through the metal?<br/><br/>There's only one way to find out.<br/><br/>",

Let's do this.<br/>I cast my acid spell on the sword, and watch it slowly turn green, as steam starts coming out of it. The sword is now drenching in acid, but the corrosive agent is not eating away at the metal as one would normally expect. Instead, it seems to be empowering it. This sword is definitely an impressive piece of work. If Daren actually had any access to elemental magic, he'd be unstoppable.<br/><br/>This is it. This is the winning card I've been waiting for. The dragon doesn't stand a chance anymore.<br/><br/>I teleport right next to Tyrath and thrust my blade into his chest. The acid melts through his scales, and the sword passes through his tough skin like a hot knife through butter. The dragon starts screaming in pain, and he teleports away, shooting flames at me. I block them with my sword, but this replaces the acid effect it had before with a fire one. So that's how this thing works. <br/><br/>I throw the fire back towards Tyrath, and cast acid on the sword once more. I teleport next to him again, and I strike at him with my acid empowered sword. He blocks my attack with one of his claws, but the sword still goes through his thick skin. <br/>The dragon spends the next minute on the defensive, teleporting away from my attacks and shooting fire at me, while I try to anticipate his moves and teleport after him. He manages to dodge most of my attacks, but the few strikes that hit him are  causing him quite a bit of damage. At this rate I won't have any trouble finishing him by the time I run out of magic.<br/><br/>",

Just like last time, Eiden sends the flames back, but this time he also surrounds the dragon with four pillars of fire that explode in his face.<br/>What is he doing?

He is now flooding the whole sky with flames, and teleporting away every time the dragon tries to reach him. They're teleporting after each other so fast that I can barely tell what's happening anymore. The whole sky looks like it's on fire, as the two combatants' vague outlines are occasionally visible through the flames.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the whole area gets covered in a blue light, and I'm starting to feel an immense magical power coming from the air all around us.<br/><br/>\"What is the meaning of this?\" the dragon asks.<br/>\"Has it been so long you've forgotten, old friend?\" Eiden says. \"Just because they haven't been activated in more than a millennia does not mean these traps are out of function. This one was just a bit out of tune, that's all.

Most of the artifacts they built in the old times are still fully functional after all!\"<br/><br/>As the two of them speak, the ground is shaking violently, and the blue light is intensifying.<br/><br/>\"Listen to me, stillwater. Your little tricks won't last forever. This won't keep me away for long. And when I get out, you're going to wish you were never born. Do you hear me?!

I want to make sure that Eiden isn't hiding around us invisibly and listening to what we're saying.\"<br/>Kate nods, and she sends a powerful wave of freezing magic all around us. The air has suddenly gotten a lot chillier, and all of the trees now look like they're made of crystal, but there's no sign of the stillwater. Even if he got to block Kate's attack, we would still have sensed at least some magical power coming from him if he were still here. I guess he really did just teleport away after all.<br/><br/>\"I don't understand,\" Rose says. \"What's gotten into everyone? Eiden saved all of our lives! I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave Barry all of those powers that allowed him to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?\"<br/><br/>\"It's because he is our enemy,\" Kate tells her bluntly. \"When we first met him this morning, he tried to kill Daren outright and ultimately decided against it, on a whim. If what you're saying is true, and he really did save all of our lives, then I am inclined to believe that this was also a decision he made on a whim. What was the motivation he gave for saving the four of us?\"<br/><br/>Kate's rebuttal made Rose lose a bit of steam.<br/><br/>\"He, uh...\"<br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"He said that he couldn't let the dragon win, after having gloated like a villain from a children's storybook...\"<br/><br/>\"Well, there you have it. But never mind Eiden's intentions. What I am most interested in knowing is how you both got to interact with him in the middle of our fight, when neither me nor Daren saw him appear until the end of the battle.\"<br/><br/>\"He froze time,\" I tell her.<br/><br/>\"Froze time?!\" Daren asks, perplexed. \"How is that even possible?\"<br/><br/>\"Beats me. He just snapped his fingers and made time stop for everyone except me and him.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,  what about Rose?\" Kate asks.<br/><br/>\"He said... that I was able to resist his spell because I'm a time weaver,\" Rose answers her.<br/><br/>\"What the hell is a time weaver?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>",
