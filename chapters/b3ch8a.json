Let me try to give you a bit more context, so you can better understand where I'm coming from,\" I say, as I begin to give Daren and everyone else more details about how it felt to be nearly erased from existence on the two separate occasions when I was forced to confront the Magium directly.<br/><br/>It has now been almost two hours since Albert teleported us back to the rebel base. To our surprise, the rebels and the king of the underground's men had already cleared most of the rubble by the time we returned from the seredium tower, and their earth elementalists even managed to repair many of the ceilings that were destroyed during the royal guards' attacks, so there wasn't much work left for us to do when we got here.<br/><br/> After we informed everyone of the king of Ollendor's death, we tried to help out the civilians who were harmed during the battle as best as we could, and then we went back to our room so we could have a discussion about everything that has happened recently, and about what our plans are for the immediate future.<br/>During all this time, Melindra has been extremely fidgety, due to the fact that according to the enchanter's oath she took when we first met her she was supposed to start leading us towards the pine cone detector as soon as we killed the king of Ollendor, unless we would specifically ask her to take a break from our trip. Considering that she could easily die even if she breaks her vow by mistake I can't say that I blame her, but then again, aside from repeatedly telling her that we do not want her to lead us out of Ollendor right now, there isn't much more that Daren or any of us can do to fix her current situation.<br/><br/>\"Alright...\" Daren says, once I am done giving him a detailed explanation of my previous encounters with the Magium. <br/><br/>\"Alright...\" Daren repeats himself, trying hard to keep his composure as he is attempting to make sense of the seemingly impossible and contradictory information that I've just given him. \"So... what you're saying is that it's not just our memories... but the very notion of those two fingers that got completely wiped from our universe. And the only way you can retain your memories of such things is if you have lessathi blood running through your veins, because of your natural affinity to the Magium. Just to be clear, out of the people in this room, this description applies to Barry, Leila, doctor Reidzek and Melindra, right?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, yes, we've been over this before,\" Melindra says. \"The four of us remember that Gontrok had five fingers on his left hand while the rest of you don't. Can we leave the city, now? I feel like the oath is making it harder for me to breathe with every extra minute we spend here.\"<br/>\"Ugh...\" Daren says. \"Melindra, for the last time, it is not possible for the oath to try to kill you without giving us both a warning beforehand. It's not the enchanter's oath that's causing you to have breathing problems, it's the fact that you're panicking too much. Try to take deep breaths and to relax a little. You told us that it's going to take several days to reach your 'friend' with the pine cone detector, so it's not like we'll be able to just do one long sprint until we get there. We're still going to have to take breaks on the way. Are you planning to have panic attacks like this every time we need to get some water from a river or go to sleep?\"<br/><br/>\"I didn't say that!\" Melindra says. \"I'm just saying that we shouldn't spend more time in this accursed city than is absolutely necessary. The king is already dead, so what other business do we have here?\"<br/><br/>\"I am not leaving this room until I get a decent understanding of why these crystals started behaving like this all of a sudden, and how this is going to affect us, moving forward,\" Daren says. \"Barry and Leila told us how Eiden was warning the king of dire consequences or something of the sort for disturbing the crystals with his explosions. Arraka, do you have any idea what he could have meant?\"<br/><br/>",

You're the one who told us what the crystals are made of, aren't you?\"<br/><br/>\"The only practical use for these crystals as far as I know is to help sustain very complex modifications to the auras of objects when building magical devices,\" Arraka says. \"Since I am neither a gnome nor a lessathi, I couldn't have any less interest in tinkering with devices and therefore my knowledge of these crystals and what they are capable of is extremely limited. I've already told you most of what I know on this particular subject.\"<br/><br/>\"On the subject of the crystals, you mean,\" Daren says, frowning slightly. \"On the subject of the Magium itself, you still remain as vague as ever.\"<br/><br/> \"Do you really think I'm going to risk getting erased from existence again, just to satisfy your curiosity?\" Arraka says. \"You shouldn't even need to ask me this question, because you should already have a pretty good idea of what its true nature is with the information that is available to you, especially after Barry and Leila's last encounter with it. And besides, it's not like I know everything there is to know about the Magium either. Up until recently, I was under the impression that the Magium is a generally passive entity, hardly worthy of even being considered a threat, but these latest events are forcing me to consider that maybe it can become a much more active force than I've previously assumed to be possible. I would need a lot more time to study it in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion, and it's not like I'm going to be making much progress on that front while I'm stuck in this amulet.\"<br/>\"Well...\" Daren says, looking slightly taken aback by Arraka's answer. \"If even Arraka admits to having some trouble making sense of all of this, I'm not sure how much we'll be able to figure out on our own, but I suppose it's true that we do have a general idea now of what the Magium is, or at least what it's capable of. We know that it can erase things and people from existence and we know that a mere fraction of its will is able to unmake an entire universe without much effort, so its power is pretty much limitless. However, we also know that it can be tricked, since both Arraka and the God of Fate were able to escape from it by using a... suggestion spell, was it?...\"<br/><br/> \"What?...\" Arraka says. \"No, of course we didn't use a suggestion spell on the Magium! What are you, nuts?\"<br/>\"I was pretty sure that's what you told Barry you did when you were attacked by the Magium during the God of Time's ritual,\" Daren says. \"Am I remembering things wrong?\"<br/><br/>",

Obviously it wasn't a spell in the true sense of the word. How could something as simple as magic possibly work against an entity capable of unmaking entire worlds at a moment's notice?...\"<br/>\"Okay, so if it wasn't magic, what did you use, then?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"...How do you expect me to explain this to you when you don't even know the basics of--\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"Actually, you know what? Screw it!\" Arraka says, after a short while. \"If my plan is to use you clowns to enact my vengeance upon the God of Time and all the other gods who exiled me from the magical plane, then I can't afford to do things the traditional way anymore. I'm going to need to learn to think outside the box. If I can't find a way to explain these extraordinarily complex concepts in a way that even a group of inebriated primates would understand, then I have failed as a teacher.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, yes, we get it,\" Hadrik says. \"We're all as dumb as a bunch of drunken apes. Now can you hurry up and get to the point before--\"<br/><br/> \"And once the monkeys understand what I'm saying,\" Arraka continues, \"all I need to do is to dumb things down even more until we reach your level and then we'll finally begin making some progress!\"<br/>\"Hey, wait just a minute--\" Hadrik starts to say, but Daren interrupts him.<br/><br/>\"Are you planning to answer my question or not?\" Daren asks, looking straight at the amulet.<br/><br/>\"Fine, fine,\" Arraka says. \"To put it in the simplest terms possible, what I did was that I used a primordial type of 'magic' that dates from way back when the three planes of existence weren't separate yet. Obviously, I'm only calling it magic for lack of another word, because it really can't compare with anything that you might--\"<br/><br/>\"Whoa, whoa, whoa...\" Daren says. \"Did you just imply that the earthen, magical and ethereal plane all used to be merged into one big plane of existence a long time ago? How would you even know about any of this? Don't tell me that you were alive when the split happened...\"<br/><br/> \"No, I wasn't there at the time, but you can find hints that point towards this fact if you know where to look,\" Arraka says. \"One of these hints being the very existence of the primordial magic that I was talking about earlier. Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that it's meaningless to try to influence the Magium unless you're doing it on all three planes of existence simultaneously, and one of the few ways to do this is to use a type of 'magic' so ancient that it ignores the boundaries of the planes altogether.\"<br/>\"All three planes of existence simultaneously...\" Daren says, looking somewhat lost in his thoughts. \"Barry, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you mention earlier that you and Leila were being flung back and forth throughout all of the planes of existence while the Magium was trying to unmake our reality?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's right,\" I say, as Leila nods at the same time, confirming that this was the case for her as well.<br/><br/>\"So,\" Daren says, \"if the Magium can throw you across different planes of existence... and if it can only be attacked on all the planes at the same time... my guess is that it must somehow be related to this 'primordial' plane that existed before the split happened, right? I don't really see any other reasonable explanation that takes all these factors into account. What do you guys think?\"<br/><br/>",

How are you guys even keeping up with this conversation anymore? Can we change the topic to something a little easier to understand? I mean, it's not like we NEED to know exactly what the Magium is. At this point, I'd just be happy to know how to avoid it and how to defend myself from it if it ever tries to kill us again. How did the other Arraka manage to hide from it all this time, anyway? Why would a being as powerful and as knowledgeable as the Magium even need our help to find her in the first place?\"<br/>\"She probably hid the true coordinates of her universe so that the Magium couldn't find her world no matter how hard it tried,\" Arraka says. \"I know that's what I'd have done if I were in her place.\"<br/><br/>\"But you gave the Magium her world's real coordinates, right?\" Daren says. \"Does this mean that we shouldn't need to worry about her anymore during the next God of Time's ritual?\"<br/><br/> \"Eh...\" Arraka says. \"As much as I'd love to think that were true, I don't really see how an Arraka could possibly be killed so easily, even if she is just a copy. There are many other ways to conceal yourself from the Magium aside from simply hiding your universe's coordinates, and I'm sure the other Arraka wouldn't hesitate to use all of the aces up her sleeve if she felt that she was getting backed into a corner. If I were to take a bet, I'd say we'll most likely meet her again in the next ritual, and she'll be more pissed than ever. So, you know... Good luck! Aha-Ahahahahaha!\"<br/>\"Fantastic...\" Daren says. \"Should we also expect the Magium to come back here with a vengeance when it realizes that the coordinates you gave it are useless?\"<br/><br/>\"Nah,\" Arraka says. \"What the Magium saw were my memories, so it knows that I wasn't lying or withholding any information. Since it doesn't have anything else to gain from us, it will probably have to continue to chase the other Arraka on its own from now on, just as it was doing before it encountered us.\"<br/><br/> \"And if it decides to come back for whatever reason?\" Daren says. \"What then? Do we just stand there powerless again and pray to all the gods we're trying to kill that Arraka will pull through and save our sorry behinds one more time?\"<br/>\"Daren makes a good point,\" Kate says. \"For the moment, our only strategy in these types of scenarios is to overly rely on Arraka and to hope that everything will work out in the end. There has to be something more we can do. I think a good starting point would be to better understand just how exactly these primordial 'spells' are supposed to work, because I simply can't bring myself to understand how a being that exists beyond time and space can be influenced by any type of technique, regardless of its complexity.\"<br/><br/>\"The Magium itself may exist outside the boundaries of time, but that is not the form in which it interacts with people,\" Arraka says. \"On the rare occasions when the Magium ever comes into contact with anyone, it typically does so through 'manifestations of its will', so to speak. I prefer to call them fragments. These fragments often operate independently of each other and they usually have a singular purpose in mind, so despite their overwhelming power, they have their limitations which can be exploited. Among their many limitations, the most important one is that they are bound by the constrictions of time, like the rest of us, which makes it possible for us to 'influence' them. Oh, and just to be clear, the entities that have tried to erase us from existence so far were both Magium fragments, even if I may have called them just 'Magium' in the past, for simplicity's sake.\"<br/><br/>",

As long as I don't say these words that I feel best summarize what exactly the Magium is, I think I can afford the small risk of talking about the Magium's fragments and their weaknesses, while we are situated outside its realm.\"<br/><br/>\"Interesting,\" Daren says. \"So it should be fine to ask you more details about primordial magic then, right? Because I was wondering, for example, if you knew how many other people are currently able to cast these types of 'spells' aside from you and the God of Fate?\"<br/><br/> \"Hmm, that's a tough question...\" Arraka says. \"Technically, most of the gods and also some of the other powerful spirits from the magical plane should have the potential to cast primordial magic, but I can't tell you with a certainty which ones actually know these techniques aside from Memphir, because I haven't really spoken to them much in the past five thousand years so I have no idea what they've been up to lately. If we're talking about people on the earthen plane who might already know how to use such techniques, however, I can't really think of any other examples except for Eiden... and maybe that old sage, Azarius. They both strike me as the types who would have the knowledge, the power and the ingenuity to have researched such techniques by now, despite their relatively young age compared to most spirits on the magical plane.\"<br/>\"And what about our group?\" Kate asks. \"Out of all the people in this room, who do you think would have the most potential to learn primordial magic?\"<br/><br/>\"The people in this room?!\" Arraka says, seemingly in a state of complete shock that Kate could have even thought to ask such a question. \"Are you being serious right now?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Kate says. \"I'm not asking you whether any of us would be suited to learn this type of magic or not. I'm only asking you strictly in terms of potential, if you absolutely had to choose just one member of our group to teach primordial magic to, who would you choose?\"<br/>\"If we're talking strictly in terms of potential...\" Arraka says, as she appears to be racking her brains in an attempt to come up with a legitimate answer to Kate's question. \"And if I ABSOLUTELY had no other choice than to pick someone from your group... then I would probably say that...\"<br/><br/>She pauses for a short while, as if the words she were about to say were simply refusing to come out.<br/><br/>\"Barry... would be my most likely choice,\" Arraka says finally, in a tone that suggests how utterly disgusted she is with herself for having allowed herself to even consider such an option.<br/><br/>",

In a normal situation, you wouldn't even make the bottom of the list!\"<br/><br/>\"I don't get it,\" Hadrik says. \"Why would you choose Barry? Do you not need to be a mage to cast primordial magic?\"<br/><br/>\"Obviously you do, but that's what his magic stats are for, aren't they?\" Arraka says. \"Did you already forget how I said that unlocking his magical stats should be our highest priority?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, okay, but we have no way of knowing how long that will take,\" Hadrik says. \"Wouldn't it be faster to just teach the primordial magic to someone who is already a mage?\"<br/><br/>\"No, that's not how it works,\" Arraka says. \"A prerequisite for learning primordial magic is to already have a firm grasp on the theoretical notions regarding all types of regular magic, and this kind of knowledge is something that most of you sorely lack. Barry is the closest thing we have to a generalist in this group, so even with his huge handicap of not being able to cast magic, he'd still be the best candidate by a wide margin. As an added bonus, he is also a half-lessathi, so he would likely find it easier than the rest of you to link himself to a Magium fragment and cast the primordial spell on it once he finally gets his magic powers.\"<br/><br/> \"Once he gets his magic powers, huh?...\" Daren says. \"When will that happen, I wonder? If even Leila's father wasn't able to unlock these stats by force and the code for unlocking them is nowhere to be found, what chance do we realistically have to accomplish this goal before the end of the tournament?\"<br/>\"If you can't unlock the stats by force,\" Arraka says, \"then clearly your next course of action should be to find one of the high-ranking lessathi that know the code and to wring the information out of them by using any means necessary. Do I really have to tell you everything?\"<br/><br/>\"Easier said than done,\" Daren says. \"It's not like anyone from our group who's ever been in contact with a high-ranked lessathi has kept in touch with them or anything. Kate, Leila and doctor Reidzek are all probably considered enemies by the current lessathi leadership, and I doubt there's any other person in this room who could know the whereabouts of-- hey, Melindra, you're looking rather tense. Is something wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Melindra says, in a slightly nervous tone. \"There's nothing wrong. Everything's fine!\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Daren says, as he studies her for a few seconds.<br/><br/>\"If she doesn't want to talk about it, we should probably let her be,\" I tell Daren. \"For all we know, her brother might be held hostage by some high-ranked lessathi and she could risk endangering him if she gives us too many details.\"<br/><br/> \"You're right,\" Daren says. \"I haven't thought about that. Melindra, I don't know what the situation with your brother is, but if there's anything we can do to help, please let us know.\"<br/>\"Of course...\" Melindra says, somewhat hesitantly. \"If anything comes to mind, I'll tell you...\"<br/><br/>\"So, umm... does anybody else get the feeling that we're being watched?\" Flower says, all of a sudden, as she is looking a little anxiously at the crystals that are just now shining brightly again.<br/><br/>\"Being watched through the crystals, you mean?\" Daren says. \"I guess we can't really ignore the possibility, but I don't see a reason why someone or something as powerful as the Magium would not simply reveal itself to us directly instead of hiding.\"<br/><br/>",

In necromancy, there are certain spells that summon skeletons who get to keep the memories from their former lives. These memories cannot be retrieved from the ethereal plane, because the soul dissolves into ethereal matter shortly after the body dies, but they can, however be retrieved from the traces of the aura surrounding the dead body. The way these spells function is that they create a temporary manufactured soul in the ethereal plane which they attach to the body, and then they copy all of the memories from the corpse's aura and send them to this soul in order to make everything as close as possible to how things used to work when the body was still alive. I believe that the spells used to create revenants should also work in a similar fashion.\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, yes, I know how necromancy works,\" Arraka says. \"What I want to know is why the lessathi would waste their time and resources manufacturing a soul for the likes of you? Why would they even bother giving you any semblance of free will? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of creating an artificial intelligence?\"<br/>\"Perhaps my creators felt that a pure machine would never have any hope of understanding humans or lessathi well enough to perform the tasks that were expected of me,\" the Overseer says. \"Unfortunately, I can only guess their true intentions, since there were clearly some pieces of information that they didn't seem to trust me enough to share with me. For example, I am quite certain that there were at least a few books in the old lessathi libraries mentioning the Magium, but despite this fact, I had almost no information regarding this mysterious entity before listening in on your discussion from earlier.\"<br/><br/> \"You still haven't told us how you managed to communicate with us through the crystal,\" Daren says. \"Or why you were even spying on us in the first place.

Since the Magium's knowledge was still very fresh in my memory at that time, I was quickly able to find out how these crystals connect to each other and how to exploit their connection to my advantage. As for your second question, the reason why I wanted to contact you was clearly to continue our previous conversation that we left unfinished.

        "text": " \"Ahem!\" Leila's father says. \"If I may... I just wanted to tell you all how fascinating I found your discussion about the Magium from earlier to be! As a lower-ranked lessathi, my knowledge about the Magium was limited only to fairy-tales, so it was most exhilarating for me to be a participant of your spirited debate, even if only as a spectator!\" <br/>\"Oh,\" Daren says. \"Well, I wish I could share your sentiment, doctor. Unfortunately, for me, personally, this whole ordeal with the Magium 'fragments' has done nothing but to cast further doubts in my mind about whether or not this prize that they're offering at the end of the tournament would be of any use to me.\"<br/><br/>\"How so?\" Leila's father says.<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Daren says, \"I'm not sure how to tell you this, but when I first heard that they were giving us 'access' to the Magium, I sort of assumed that I wouldn't need to jump through hoops just to understand how this 'access' even works. At this point, I am fully expecting the tournament organizers to just put me in front of some big blue crystal at the end and to tell me that I need to use my aura to link to it or something in order to access the Magium's knowledge. If they were to say this to someone like... let's say, Azarius, I'm sure he would probably figure out what to do, but with the knowledge I have... I can't help but think that I'm a little out of my depth, here.\"<br/><br/>Arraka laughs.<br/><br/> We walk towards the waiting room for a little while until we reach a corridor that has no blue crystals in the walls at all and is lit entirely by torches. We continue to move forward without saying a word for another minute or so, until doctor Reidzek decides to finally break the silence by clearing his throat.<br/><br/> \"You only figured that out now?\" she says. \"What did you think was gonna happen, anyway? You figured that maybe they'd give you some trinket and all you'd need to do was press a few buttons to get the Magium? Is that what was going through your head when you joined this tournament?\"<br/>\"Well... yes, actually!\" Daren says. \"What else was I supposed to think? They're offering it as a prize, aren't they? Nobody said it was a prize that could potentially end our entire world if you pissed it off too much!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, obviously the kings didn't say that, because they most likely have no idea what they're offering,\" Arraka says. \"And the lessathi who are also in charge of organizing the tournament probably didn't feel like telling them about it, because they have their own hidden agenda, and they wouldn't want the kings to find out what's really at stake here. I haven't exactly been paying attention to the politics of Varathia, but if I were to take an educated guess, I'd say that both the kings and the lessathi are hiding something from each other, and they both think that they have the upper hand. They each most likely have their own secret purpose for organizing this tournament, and you losers are too busy dancing to their tune to even consider that you might be getting duped.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"That is also possible, yes,\" Illuna says.<br/>\"What about the lessathi organizers, then?\" Daren says. \"What would they have to gain from all of this?\"<br/><br/>\"It's possible that the lessathi are trying to take advantage of the chaos being caused by this tournament to seize control of some of the kingdoms of Varathia,\" Kate says. \"Another possibility is that they could in fact want the tournament prize for themselves, and they only helped with the organization so that the kings would lead them to the location from where the Magium can be accessed. It's hard to guess what their true purpose is when we know so little about them.\"<br/><br/>\"Your friend, Diane, was part of Meridith's elite guard, right?\" I ask Kate. \"We could try to ask her about this when we finally meet her again. She might know something about their plans.\"<br/><br/>\"We'll see,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"I have to say...\" Daren tells me. \"I am surprised at how calm and collected you are being right now, Barry. Of all the people here, you are probably by far the one who wants the Magium the most. How are you so unaffected by the fact that the prize you've been fighting so hard to obtain may prove to be completely worthless to you?\"<br/><br/> \"So the kings knew from the beginning that the majority of the contestants couldn't even hope to use the Magium, but they let us join anyway?!\" Hadrik shouts. \"That's even worse than making us hunt for pinecones that can't be detected by anyone other than stillwaters and sages! Do these kings really have no respect at all for the lives of the hundreds or maybe even thousands of mages that died in this tournament, fighting over nothing?\"<br/>\"Maybe that is what the kings were aiming for, from the very beginning,\" Illuna says. \"Maybe their true objective was to lure the most powerful mages of the main continents away from their homelands, and to encourage them to kill each other so that every continent aside from Varathia would be simultaneously robbed of their strongest fighters. At this rate, I wouldn't be too surprised if the Varathian kings were planning to invade the other continents soon after the end of this tournament.\"<br/><br/>\"Or perhaps the Varathian kings were getting worried that THEY might get invaded, for whatever reason,\" I say, \"and decided to preemptively cull the numbers of their potential attackers. That could also explain why they specifically asked for the winner of this tournament to become the protector of Varathia in case of an outside invasion.\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, it's because I've already had this conversation before... with Kate,\" I say. \"She saw that I was becoming hesitant about the Magium after what happened in the God of Time's ritual, and she helped me gain back my motivation by suggesting an alternate way in which I could make use of the Magium to turn myself into a mage.\"<br/>\"Is that so?\" Daren says, as he gives Kate an impressed look for a few seconds before turning his gaze back to me. \"And what was this suggestion that she gave you?\"<br/><br/>\"The idea is for me to first of all unlock my magical stats from my device in order to be able to use my temporary magical powers to link myself to the Magium,\" I say. \"Then, once I have access to all of the Magium's knowledge, I can take my time researching a way to modify my stat device so that it can extract energy directly from the magical plane instead of getting it from the mages around me, which would essentially turn me into a full-fledged mage. I know it's not a perfect plan, but after giving it some thought, I'd say I'm pretty confident in my odds of success!\"<br/><br/>\"Well...\" Daren says. \"I'm not exactly sure what to say about the viability of your plan, but one thing is for certain. We could all use some of your optimism right now.\"<br/><br/>",
