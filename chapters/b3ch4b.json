Once she confirms that we're all paying attention, she opens the secret door in the same way that she opened the last one, and then we exit the tunnel one by one, making our way into what appears to be some kind of workshop.<br/>\"Wh-wh-what are you doing here?...\" we hear the panicked voice of Billy Bob the lessathi, who is standing next to a table in the middle of the room that has a disassembled drone on top of it. \"Who are you people? Drones! Attack them right now! Kill them! Kill them!\"<br/><br/>There are six red-eyed drones hovering right above the lessathi, but they seem in no hurry to carry out his orders. Seeing that the drones are ignoring him, Billy Bob now addresses a green-eyed drone to his right.<br/><br/>\"Overseer, what is the meaning of this?\" Billy Bob says.<br/><br/> \"Question unclear,\" the Overseer says, as Illuna closes the secret door behind us. \"Please rephrase your previous query.\"<br/>\"Why are your drones not killing them?!\" Billy Bob shouts, as he points towards us. \"I told you to kill them!\"<br/><br/>\"Unfortunately your request cannot be resolved at this current time,\" the Overseer says. \"We apologize for the inconvenience!\"<br/><br/>\"Cannot be resolved...\" Billy Bob says, perplexed. \"Are... are you betraying me?...\"<br/><br/>The green-eyed drone does not say anything, but the answer is obvious to everyone in the room. It looks like there is nobody left in this workshop that could possibly take Billy Bob's side. He is completely defenseless. Now then... what should our next course of action be?<br/><br/>All of a sudden, I see that Kate is preparing several icicles and that she is aiming them at Billy Bob, while giving him a look full of disgust.

For example, you're saying that you can't free the prisoners right now, but what if you spent some time trying to figure out how to get energy from a different source?

You only need to keep your Overseer protocol functional and a few of your drones. Everything else can wait. Those flying metal vehicles outside, those large holographic screens, the giant golems protecting the walls... none of them are necessary! What if you were to temporarily stop providing energy to all of those things? How long would you still need to keep the prisoners in the dungeon?\"<br/><br/> \"One week,\" the Overseer says. \"However, if your primary purpose is to reduce the number of victims, this course of action is highly inadvisable. According to my estimations, the chaos that would ensue as a result of deactivating every technologically advanced device in the city at once would most likely lead to a large number of civilian casualties. Would that be an acceptable compromise for you?\"<br/>\"No...\" Kate says, as she calms down a little. \"I suppose not.\"<br/><br/>\"Then I would like to propose to you an alternative solution,\" the Overseer says. \"By analyzing the information you've given me so far, I have concluded that your goal is to minimize the amount of emotional and physical suffering for the people living in this city. This happens to be the same goal that the lessathi of old had in mind when they first created the Overseer protocol. If I were to obtain full control of this city, such a scenario would become achievable. But that would require you to both successfully assassinate the current king, and to willingly grant me full control of Ollendor once you conquer the city. Essentially, you would be making me the new king.\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on a minute, there...\" I say. \"First of all, what do you mean the lessathi of old created you to 'minimize suffering'? What exactly was your original purpose before you started 'assisting yourself'?\" <br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, right after the protocol had been perfected and the time came to give me full control of the city, the leaders were too afraid to hand over their power to an 'emotionless' machine, so they decided to deactivate me and to completely abandon the project, leaving me in an inactive state for thousands of years, until I was finally reactivated by Biliborrathrathsarran.\"<br/>\"So that's why you decided to only provide assistance to yourself, then?\" I ask the Overseer. \"Because you were betrayed by the very people that created you?\"<br/><br/>The Overseer does not answer me, but I'm going to take that silence as a 'yes'.<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" I continue, \"so what guarantee do we have that you'll actually follow through with your promises, considering how you've already told us that you now only care about your own well-being?\"<br/><br/> \"Accomplishing the purpose I was originally created for does not conflict with my current goals,\" the Overseer says. \"All I wish for is to be able to exist freely, without any risk of being deactivated again.

How many more times will they be forced to scream in agony while those chains and container light up and steal all their energy?\"<br/><br/>\"The event you are describing only happens because the energy collecting process is being made inefficiently,\" the Overseer says. \"If the energy gathering were to be made in a more uniform manner, the prisoners should not be feeling any pain whatsoever. I would be able to fix this right away if the lessathi you refer to as Billy Bob were killed. As for freeing them completely, a period of transition would be required, but it could be achievable in less than a month without affecting the daily lives of the citizens too much, as long as I had control of the city.\"<br/><br/> \"I don't know how to tell you this, but I don't think the rebels would ever accept to be ruled by a machine,\" Breynan says. \"And neither would most of the people in this city!\"<br/>\"I never said that I would be leading the city openly,\" the Overseer says. \"The official king could be somebody else, and the citizens would simply think that my drones are controlled by the royalty, as they did before now. As long as the people think that the machines are being controlled by a human, there should be no riots. Of course, that would mean that the official king would need to be someone that I could cooperate with. Like you, Breynan.\"<br/><br/>\"Me?...\" Breynan says. \"Become the king of the city?...\"<br/><br/>\"Affirmative,\" the Overseer says. \"I would much rather have someone like you in control of my deactivation switch than Biliborrathrathsarran. The lessathi is far too unpredictable. And since you would be the official king, you could also tell me if you considered my measures to be too extreme, so I could adjust them to be more 'humane'. I believe this was the main worry that the lessathi of old had when they refused to hand over the control to me. You would be able to keep me in check, and I would be able to exist peacefully, without fear of being deactivated again. All sides would have something to gain from such an arrangement.\"<br/><br/>",

You don't need to worry about the floor tiles anymore. Just come over here!\"<br/><br/>We all listen to Flower and we head over to her side. Just like she said, the traps don't activate and we are able to reach the door safely. As soon as we walk into the next corridor, we hear the voice of a man to our right, speaking to us in a loud tone.<br/><br/>\"Who the hell are you?!\" the man shouts. \"And how did you manage to get out of that hallway without triggering any of the traps?\"<br/><br/>When we turn around, we see that there are three men dressed in uniforms with swords in their hands, all looking at us suspiciously. I should be very careful what I say, here. One wrong word and they could easily sound the alarm before we get to take them out.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Sound the alarm right now!\"<br/><br/>Just a few seconds later, a very loud alarm noise fills the entire corridor, while the guards in front of us are getting ready to surround us.<br/><br/>\"You're all coming with us,\" one of the guards says. \"You'd better not be trying to resist.\"<br/><br/>Before any of them have the time to react, six water whips appear in mid-air in front of the three men, quickly coiling themselves around each of their ankles and pulling their legs from under them, causing them to hit the backs of their heads against the ground and to lose their consciousness.<br/><br/> \"I should have done this the moment we opened that door...\" Illuna says.<br/>\"Don't worry about it,\" Breynan says. \"I'm sure we still have time to find our way out of here until the rest of the guards organize themselves to come greet us.\"<br/><br/>\"The majority of the guards seem to be coming from the right side,\" Melindra says. \"I suggest that we head to the left.\"<br/><br/>\"Good thinking,\" Breynan says. \"Let's move.\"<br/><br/>We all turn left and we make a run for the door at the end of the corridor. Once we open the door and step into the next hallway, Melindra tells us that she has detected a staircase leading upwards somewhere further down the hall. We take a right, then another right, and when we reach the stairs we begin to climb them as fast as we can, as we can hear the faint hurried steps of several guards from behind, who are slowly closing in on us.<br/><br/>",

Did you get out of the caverns?\"<br/><br/>\"Sort of,\" I say. \"But we're still in trouble and we need your help.\"<br/><br/>\"My help?...\" Rose asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" I say. \"I'll try to keep it short. Have you ever managed to freeze time of your own free will before?\"<br/><br/>\"I...\" Rose says. \"I did manage to do it a few times today, but it was only for a little while, and I'm not sure how much control I have over it. Whenever I try to maintain full control over these powers, I get tired very easily and I feel like I'm close to fainting. I'm not sure if--\"<br/><br/>\"What was the longest you managed to keep the time frozen?\" I say.<br/><br/> \"I don't know...\" Rose says. \"About... thirty seconds?\"<br/>\"That should give us enough time to get past the spinning blades,\" I tell the others. \"I think we should try it.\"<br/><br/>\"Spinning blades?!\" Rose asks shocked. \"Barry, I don't think--\"<br/><br/>\"Listen, we don't have much time,\" I say. \"There are dozens of guards breathing down our necks and they could be here any minute. Your spell freezes time in the whole world, so it should technically be possible to unfreeze us from where you are. The rebels from this city have a teleporting device that locks onto the signals from our transceivers whenever it tries to cast its spell on us. Maybe you could try doing the same thing with your spell. Try to focus on the connection between our two transceivers and maybe you could unfreeze time just for us, so we can get safely past the blades while you're still freezing the time for everyone else in the world. Do you think you can do that?\"<br/><br/>\"I can try, but... Barry, if I lose control over the spell while you're in there you'll--\"<br/><br/> \"We'll make sure to get out before that happens,\" I say. \"It shouldn't take us more than fifteen seconds to get to the stairs. We can make it. You just try to hold onto the spell as long as you can. Okay, are you ready?\"<br/>\"I suppose...\" Rose says. \"Give me a moment.\"<br/><br/>After about ten seconds of waiting, Rose suddenly begins to breathe very heavily into the transceiver.<br/><br/>\"Is something wrong?...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"It's nothing,\" Rose says, in a tired voice. \"I already froze the time twice, but I couldn't get you unfrozen. I'm sure I can do it right if I try it a third time.\"<br/><br/>\"No, actually, I think maybe we should stop before--\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, can you hear me?!\" I hear Rose shouting very loudly all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I can hear you,\" I say. \"I was saying that--\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, the time is frozen!\" Rose says. \"Head for the stairs. Do it now! I don't know how long I can hold this!\"<br/><br/>When I look at the blades, I realize that they've all stopped completely, and the flames from the torches on the walls are also apparently frozen in time. We're not going to get a better chance than this. We need to take advantage of this opportunity while it still lasts.<br/><br/>\"You heard Rose,\" I tell the others. \"Go, go, go!\"<br/><br/>",

After a while, it becomes clear that there is no way for us to stop the incoming attack, so Melindra tries to cast individual wind barriers around each of us, in the hopes that this will somehow be enough to absorb all of the damage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as soon as the drones' spell is cast, we quickly realize that no amount of protections could have shielded us from the onslaught of magical attacks that were unleashed upon us at the same time. It was difficult to tell if what killed us was the ice, the fire, the electricity or any other of the different simultaneous spells, but it took less than a second for our bodies to be completely destroyed and then to be turned into ashes.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_magical_sense || 0) >= 4) {%> My heart rate is through the roof. The speed at which I'm deciphering every one of the spells is breathtaking, and it feels as if the time has slowed down to a halt in order to allow me to have all these thoughts racing through my head at the same time. It feels like entire minutes have passed, but in reality, I don't think it's been more than a few seconds. The way before me is clear. I know what I have to do.<br/>\"We need to disrupt the flow of the spell!\" I tell everyone around me, speaking as fast as I can, while the magical energy inside the cage is becoming so dense that it's almost palpable. \"I need everyone who is a mage to cast the simplest spells they have, whenever I raise my right hand. It doesn't matter what spell, as long as you can cast it in the blink of an eye. I don't have time to explain why. Just trust me on this!\"<br/><br/>The others look at each other for a second, but then they turn their heads back to me, and they all give me a curt nod. I wait two seconds and then I raise my right hand. At the same time, Kate creates a small cube of ice, Flower sends a tiny ball of fire flying into the air, Illuna sprinkles some water on the ground, Breynan casts an orb of light and Melindra makes a few air currents rotate above her palm.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_magical_sense || 0) >= 4) {%> <br/>Something about the way in which the magic is flowing around the room suddenly reminds me of an old memory that I'd thought to be long forgotten. A few years ago, I was speaking to a hermit that everyone considered to be crazy, and he was always telling me how people are learning magic the wrong way, and how nobody would listen to him when he suggested that the magical academies should be completely restructured to follow his teachings. The main point of contention between him and the other scholars was his claim that imperfections in magical techniques are absolutely necessary if you want to create a perfect spell. The obvious contradiction in his statement made everyone dismiss him as a senile old man, but his theory was that the more a technique gets closer to perfection, the more predictable it will become, and the easier it would be to counteract it.<br/><br/>When I'm seeing the perfect way in which these machines are executing their spells, I think I'm finally beginning to understand what that hermit meant. I can tell exactly what they're trying to do, and even if they're combining ten different spells at the same time, the way they are moving the flows of the auras is so 'by the book' that it would be impossible for me to not recognize every single one of them.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_magical_sense || 0) >= 4) {%> I then lower my hand and they all stop their spells, waiting for my next signal. Five seconds later, I raise my hand again, and everyone casts the same spells as before, looking anxiously around them to see if anything has changed. The air is still heavy, but it doesn't feel like the drones' spell has been progressing in any way since our mages began casting their own spells. I continue to predict the rhythm of the drones' magic flow by using every piece of information I know about how their spells are supposed to be cast. With the aid of my magical sense stat, I can finally detect the flows well enough to be able to put all of that magical theory I've learned into practice.<br/>I keep raising my hand in the air at the perfect timing, and my friends keep following my instructions. When I raise my hand for the eight time, the pressure around us disappears completely all of a sudden, and it seems like the spell that the drones were casting has been permanently cancelled. The drones are currently not moving at all, looking as if they were stunned.<br/><br/><% } %>",

As soon as it's done with its attack, I fly back towards it and I try to stab it with my blade as hard as I can. This time, however, the tip of my dagger gets stopped by the barrier surrounding the drone, and the same metal ball now seems to be creating two slates of rock that it wants to smash my head with.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_strength || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_aura_hardening || 0) >= 4) {%> \"Barry, get back!\" Kate says, as she shoots an icicle straight into the drone's eye, making it drop to the ground and also causing the slates of rock to disappear.<br/>\"Oh, now I get it!\" I say. \"They're having trouble switching between their defensive barriers! It looks like one of their barriers is stronger against physical attacks, while the other is stronger against magical attacks, but they can't use them both at the same time. You know what that means, right?\"<br/><br/>I then take out my crossbow, as Kate and Illuna both ready up their spells. Before the other two drones get the time to defend themselves, the three of us shoot them simultaneously with crossbow bolts, water lances and icicles, which destroy the metal balls in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_strength || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_aura_hardening || 0) < 4) {%> <br/><br/>I take a rock from the ground, and I throw it at one of the drones.<br/><br/>Instead of hitting it, the rock simply bounces off the magical barrier around the metal ball, doing no damage to it whatsoever. I try to throw a few more rocks at it, but the result is the same.<br/><br/>\"Barry, what are you doing?...\" Kate asks me.<br/><br/>\"It's not working,\" I say. \"I think I need to get closer to them. Melindra, can you cast your air current spell around me so I can fly over to them?\"<br/><br/>\"That sounds like a pretty bad idea to me, but it's your call,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>She then waves her hands in the air a few times, and shortly afterwards I can feel the currents flowing all around me.<br/><br/>\"Thanks,\" I say, as I grab a few more rocks from the ground and I fly towards the drone that I've been attacking earlier.<br/><br/>I first try to throw a rock at it from about a dozen feet away. Nothing happens. I then try to throw another one from six feet away. Still no results. I'm sure this will work if I only get a little closer.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_strength || 0) < 3 && (locals.v_aura_hardening || 0) < 4) {%> Just as I'm about to throw the third rock, the drone shoots an ice beam out of its eye, freezing me completely.

So that the city guards can search every house and see if anyone is hiding the murderers!\"<br/><br/>\"The king's brother was killed in Thilias?\" I ask, feigning ignorance. \"But... how did he find out about this?\"<br/><br/>\"Do you really need to ask?\" the teleporter guy says. \"There is only one person who represents the king in Thilias and who would have been there to witness the events.\"<br/><br/>\"You mean...\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" the teleporter guy says. \"The ambassador from Thilias has returned.\"<br/><br/>",
