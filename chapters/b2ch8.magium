"There you are!" Melindra says, once we all get within hearing range of her. "Just in time. Tell me, are you all ready to begin our adventure?"

"If by adventure, you mean waiting in line for an hour, then yes," Daren says, as he points towards the city's northern gate.

There seem to be at least a few dozen groups of people currently lined up on the main road leading to the northern gate. Some of them are just travellers, like us, but most of them appear to be merchants, with carts full of wares that need to be inspected one by one by the guards at the city's exit, before they are allowed to pass through the gate. Judging by how long it's taking the guards to inspect each cart, I'd say that Daren's estimation might actually be a bit optimistic. We're probably going to be stuck here for a lot longer than one hour.

"Ah, yes," Melindra says, as she takes a glance towards the very long line of carts in front of her. "I forgot that the northern gate is primarily used by merchants in this city. It would have been so much nicer if they actually made more than one gate on their northern wall, to solve their traffic problems."

 "More gates means more vulnerable areas that need to be protected," Daren says. "It would not be a good idea in times such as these, when monster attacks are rampant. Let's just line up like all the others. The sun is barely up, so we'll have plenty of time to travel even if we waste another hour in this city."
"Actually, I have a better idea," Melindra says. "We'll be taking a shortcut!"

"A shortcut?" Hadrik asks, confused. "You mean, like an underground tunnel, or..."

"Oh, no, no..." Melindra says, with a smile. "I wasn't talking about a tunnel."

She then snaps her fingers, and we all begin to slowly get raised into the air, higher and higher, as I feel several currents of air moving around me, in a similar fashion to how they used to move when I was using air magic to fly, during my battle with the skeleton stillwaters.

 "No way..." Daren says, as we keep getting raised higher into the air. "You're not seriously considering doing this, are you?"
"Doing what?" Melindra says, with a coy smile.

"Don't play dumb with me!" Daren says. "You're going to fly us over that whole damn wall! Are you out of your mind? This is against the law! Those guards stationed on the wall are going to start shooting at us the moment we go over them!"

"So, what?" Melindra says. "You're a white mage and an enchanter, aren't you? You can just use that shield of yours to create a barrier around us, and we'll be fine."

"I don't have any barrier spells that deflect regular arrows!" Daren shouts.

"Wait, seriously?" Melindra says, while raising an eyebrow.

"And besides, that's not the point!" Daren says. "We don't want to make this whole city into our enemy just because we were too lazy to wait in line!"

 "You don't?" Melindra asks. "Why not? Are you planning to come back to this city afterwards?"
"Yes!" Daren says. "I mean, I think... I don't know!"

"Well, it's too late to go back now, anyway," Melindra says. "Look below us. We're already passing over their wall. And those archers are getting ready to attack us. I hope at least someone in this group can defend against arrows, because lifting so many people at once using only air magic requires a great deal of concentration, and I don't want to risk dropping any of you while trying to deflect incoming projectiles."

"Attention, to all the mages that are now flying over our wall," we hear a guard shouting through a magical voice magnifier, from the top of the city's wall. "You are to descend at once! I repeat. You are to descend at once! If you ignore this warning, we will treat you as an enemy of the kingdom, and we will open fire! I will not repeat this again!"

 "Melindra, you heard the guy," I say. "Bring us down, so we can talk to them. Maybe we can still smooth things over with the guards, somehow."
"And wait three hours in some cell before they decide to let us go?" Melindra says. "No, thanks. I'd rather deal with the arrows."

"It's not just the arrows, damn it!" I say. "I don't want to become a lawbreaker in this city again, after we went through all that trouble to get absolved of our crimes!"

"Well, tough luck, then," Melindra says. "Because I'm not planning to stop, no matter what you say. But hey, if you think you can stop me yourself, then I invite you to try. I can't wait to see what you're planning to do against a stillwater of my caliber-- AHAHAHA-- Stop it! Stop it or I'll-- Ahahaha!"

While Melindra was busy bragging, I decided I'd had enough, so I put both my hands to the sides of her waist, and began to tickle her from behind. As the girl laughs, I can feel the air currents around me become more unstable, and I start to wobble uncontrollably, in the air, along with everybody else.

"Damn it!" Melindra says, while struggling to control her laughter. "I can't-- ahaha-- I can't move away from you while I'm concentrating on levitating everyone! Ahahaha! Stop... TICKLING ME!"

 As Melindra is talking, the captain of the guards gives the order to attack, and now there are dozens of arrows heading in our direction, while our group is just floating in the air, not having moved an inch since I started tickling Melindra. As soon as she sees the arrows, Kate immediately conjures several shields made of ice, which begin to move in the air all around us, defending us from the enemy's projectiles. 
"Barry, what the hell, man?" Daren asks, as he sees himself shaking up and down, while still floating. "Do you have a death wish?"

"Relax!" I tell Daren. "It's not like she's going to drop us."

"Yes, I will!" Melindra says, "I will drop you! Just you wait-- Ahahaha! Quit it!"

"Yeah, right," I say. "You're going to tell me that you went through all this trouble to find someone who could kill that king of yours, and now you're just going to let us drop to our deaths? Just get us down, will you? Hopefully it's not too late, and we can still talk things over with the guards."

"I'm going to remember this!" Melindra says, as I stop tickling her, so she can finally start bringing us down, towards the ground.

 When the captain of the guards sees us lowering our altitude, he signals his men to cease their fire, and then he hurries towards a ladder, in order to descend from the wall, on the outer side of the city. By the time we all make it to the ground, right outside the city walls, the captain of the guards is already waiting for us impatiently, with a few of the other guards accompanying him, as his escorts. The captain is a dwarf, of around the same size as Hadrik, wearing heavy armor, with a long brown beard covering the bottom half of his face, and a steel helmet covering much of the rest, aside from his eyes and his nose. 
As soon as we reach his position, Daren and I quickly begin to explain to him what happened, while repeatedly reassuring him that we were not looking to start a fight, when we flew over their walls.

"Ugh..." the captain of the guards says with his eyes closed, as he rubs his forehead, while shaking his head in disapproval. "You know, if you really needed to leave the city in a hurry, you could have just asked one of the guards by the gate. We were all there when you people fought the dragon yesterday, together with king Golmyck, so it wouldn't have been a problem to do you a small favor in return for your service. Listen, I'm going to try my best to keep this incident off the records, but please, for the love of all the gods, don't do this kind of crap anymore. We guards are busy enough as it is. We don't have time to deal with your shenanigans."

 "Of course..." Daren says. "Thank you for your understanding! And I apologize again, in the name of our group. I hope that the next time we meet, it will be under better circumstances."
Daren and I then turn back towards the others, and we signal to them that we're good to go. Melindra still has her pouting expression on her face after what happened earlier, but she doesn't say any more on the subject for the time being, and she takes the lead, as we all move to follow her.

 "So, you're just going to ignore that guy, then?" Daren asks Melindra.
"Sure, why not?" Melindra says. "It's not like I'll ever see him again. Just make sure to deal with their arrows until we're out of their range. I mean... not you! Someone else. Someone else take care of the arrows!"

As Melindra is talking, the captain of the guards gives the order to attack, and now there are dozens of arrows heading in our direction. As soon as she sees the arrows, Kate immediately conjures several shields made of ice, which begin to move in the air all around us, defending us from the enemy's projectiles. 

"You know, it would be much easier if you just killed the archers..." Melindra tells Kate.

"I'm not going to kill the city guards for doing their job," Kate says, in a cold voice. "We are the ones in the wrong here, not them."

"Alright, alright..." Melindra says. "I'll try to increase our speed, so we'll get out of their range faster."

After about twenty more seconds, the arrows that are being shot towards us from the wall can no longer reach us, and eventually, the archers stop firing at us. Fortunately, they don't seem to be very keen on pursuing us outside the city limits, so with a little luck, this will be the last we've seen of them.

 "Great," Daren says, as we're still flying away from the city. "I don't even want to think of how much trouble we'll need to go through the next time we want to enter this city."
"You'll be fine!" Melindra says. "Just tell them that you want to speak directly with Golmyck, and you can sort it out with him. Maybe he'll ask you to pay a fine or something, but I'm sure he wouldn't send you to jail for something so minor. Alright, this is as good a place as any. I'm bringing us back to the ground!"

Melindra then makes a waving motion with her hands, and we all start to descend towards the grassy plain below us. Once we reach the ground, the stillwater girl takes the lead, and we all move to follow her.

 "Why aren't we taking the main road?" Kate asks Melindra, as she leads us towards the woods. "I saw a sign that said it was leading directly to Ollendor."
"Oh, that road takes longer than going through the forest," Melindra says. "It's because it takes a more roundabout way, through safer territories, so that the merchants can better avoid monster attacks. There's no need for us to take such precautions, though. Most of you are powerful mages, right? Well, nowhere near as powerful as I am, but still..."

"Can you stop with the condescending remarks?" I tell her. "It's clear that your level of power cannot even compare to that of Eiden. And if we're talking regular stillwaters, then we already beat five of them at once without much trouble. They weren't anything special. Hell, I practically finished them all off by myself!"

"Stop bragging, you idiot!" Arraka says. "If it weren't for my advice, and your stupidly overpowered lessathi relic, those 'regular' stillwaters would have stomped you all into the ground!"

 "Okay, fine, I admit it!" I say. "We may have gotten a bit lucky there, but still, there were five of them, and they were a squad! She's just one stillwater, and not a particularly impressive one, either. Judging by what spells I've seen her cast until now, I'd say she's an air elementalist. Isn't that right, Melindra?"
"And what if I am?" Melindra says.

"That's like... the single weakest type of elementalist in existence," I say. "Even if you take into account all the artificial mages with their non-traditional elements invented by the lessathi. Can you even cast anything other than wind spells?"

"Of course I can!" Melindra says, visibly upset.

"Oh, yeah?" I say. "Well, why don't you teleport us all to the city of Ollendor right now, then? Eiden could have done it."

"I am not Eiden," Melindra says.

 "Okay, okay, my mistake," I say. "But surely, a powerful air elementalist such as yourself could easily fly us all the way there, right? Oh, wait... I just remembered that you could barely keep us afloat while we were going over that wall.  So, I'm supposing that flying is off the table too, then? Huh... Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys, but to me, stillwaters are beginning to sound less like legendary mages, and more like regular mages with a little extra power and energy! Funny how this works, eh?"
Melindra is now furrowing her eyebrows and pursing her lips, making yet another pouting expression, as she looks at me.

"That's enough, Barry!" Daren says. "We only just began our journey. You don't want us to be fighting all the way to Ollendor, do you?"

"Hey, I'm just saying..." I say. "If she were to admit that she's not as powerful as she thinks she is, and that we could easily beat her if we were to all team up against her, then it would be much easier for all of us."

 "Well, what if I were to prove you wrong, then?" Melindra says, smirking, as she cracks her knuckles. "All we need is for your white mage to temporarily cancel the effects of his enchanter's oath, and we can get down to business."
"Hey, now we're talking!" Hadrik says, with a grin.

"Sounds good to me," I say.

"Ahahaha!" Arraka says, as I see Kate smack herself hard in the face. "You're all going to get obliterated! That girl doesn't know how to hold back. Ahahahaha!"

"Shut up!" Daren shouts. "Nobody is fighting anyone! I am not going to undo the oath just because you people want a sparring match! We are outside city limits! We could be getting attacked by enemy mages at any moment. We don't have time to play games, here!"

"Fine!" Melindra says, frowning.

 "What if we only ask her to demonstrate her powers, without fighting us?"
"Hmm..." Daren says. "Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to know what she's capable of. Seeing as how we'll be working together for a while..."

"Perfect!" Melindra says, as her face lights up. "Hold on. Let me get really far away from you, because I wouldn't want to end up burying you under a ton of rocks by accident!"

"Uh..." Daren says. "What exactly are you planning to--"

He doesn't get to finish his sentence, because Melindra flies into the air right away, and she eventually gets far enough from us that we can barely even distinguish her shape anymore. She then stops very high up in the sky, and she appears to be raising her arms in the air, as she is channeling her spell. Not long afterwards, we feel a very powerful wind coming towards us, as we watch the air currents below Melindra spinning faster and faster, until they turn into a full-blown tornado. 

Dozens of trees are now getting pulled from their roots and being lifted into the air by the giant twister in the distance, and even large rocks underneath the soil are starting to break off from the ground. As a large cloud of dust covers the whole area between us and the tornado, the merchants from Thilias are beginning to stop by the side of the road, in order to gaze at the terrifying spectacle that is unraveling before their eyes. 

 "Okay, Melindra, I think you've made your point!" Daren shouts, as loud as he can. "You should come down, now. You're scaring the locals."
As soon as she hears Daren call out to her, Melindra begins to cancel her spell, and all of the air currents forming the tornado slowly come to a halt, over the next thirty seconds, while the trees and the rocks that were caught in the tornado fall to the ground, one by one. Once the twister has dissipated into the air, Melindra comes flying back, and she lands in front of us, with a victorious smile on her face.

"How was that for a demonstration of my powers?" she says.

"Okay, okay..." I say. "You win this round. Maybe the air element isn't as weak as I made it out to be earlier."

"Of course it isn't!" Melindra says. "Even wind by itself can do this much damage, but this is magic wind we're talking about! You can sharpen it like any other element. You can reinforce it. Do you have any idea how many possibilities--"

Melindra suddenly stops in the middle of her sentence, as she briefly falls from her feet, with her eyes closing, looking as if she were seconds away from fainting.

"Are... you alright?" Daren says, while he helps her regain her balance.

"I'm fine," Melindra says, simply, as she rubs her forehead, with her eyes still closed.

 "Hah!" Arraka says. "I told you she doesn't know when to hold back. She used up all of her energy to make that tornado, and now she's so tired she can barely even stand up anymore!"
"Wait, are you serious?" Daren says, while he is still holding Melindra, to make sure that she won't faint again. "Should we take a break or something?"

"I said I'm fine!" Melindra says, as she pulls herself away from Daren. "Let's keep going."

We all exchange a few looks, but we don't say anything else, and we follow her in silence for the next few minutes. At the beginning, it was pretty obvious for everyone that Melindra was making an effort to even walk straight, but her situation gradually improved as we advanced through the forest, probably as a result of her magical energy getting slowly restored as she walked.

 "So..." I say to Melindra, as we travel through the area filled with craters and fallen trees caused by the earlier tornado. "Do you still remember our discussion from yesterday? You were just about to tell us how stillwaters are created, but then we got sidetracked, and we never really got back to our initial conversation afterwards. Shall we continue where we left off?"
"That is a lie, and you know it," Melindra says. "I never said I would tell you anything about how you can become a stillwater."

"Okay, you never said you would... but you will tell us, right?" I say.

"No," Melindra says.

We walk through the forest for a few minutes, during which none of us say anything. Once I start to feel that the tension has died down a bit, I decide to bring up our conversation from yesterday, in the hopes of getting more information from Melindra.

 "Because Eiden decided after the still winter that we should keep what happened to us a secret," Melindra says. "He was worried that if people found out how we became stillwaters, certain individuals might try to exploit that knowledge for their own benefit."
"Wait," Hadrik says. "Are you saying that all the stillwaters got created during the still winter?"
 
"Sort of," Melindra says. "At any rate, I think it would be very unlikely for you to meet any stillwaters that are younger than six hundred years old."

"Does this mean that all stillwaters are immortal?" Kate asks.

"No, not immortal!" Melindra says. "We can be killed just fine. It's just that we stopped aging as soon as we turned into stillwaters. We also became sterile, and mostly immune to diseases, but that's beside the point."
 
"So, none of the stillwaters can have kids?" Hadrik says.

"Yes, that's what I just said," Melindra says.

"But where are all the other stillwaters?" Daren says.

 "Dead, most likely," Melindra says. "Most of them got killed by Eiden, but there were also some of them that went wild and got hunted down by various mercenaries. I think there may have been others I don't remember, but either way, I haven't met other stillwaters aside from Eiden in ages. I heard he's been travelling around the world for a while, so I'm guessing that most legends you know about stillwaters were actually about him."
"Did you just say that Eiden killed most of the other stillwaters?" Daren says. "Why did he do that? And when?"

"Well..." Melindra says. "To be quite honest, I think I may have already said too much on this subject. If you want to know more, you'll have to ask Eiden directly."

"Could you at least tell us how you met Eiden, and what is your affiliation with him?" Kate asks. "Are you related by any chance?"

"Oh, no, we're not related," Melindra says.

"Ex-lovers, then?" Hadrik asks.

 "Thank you!" Melindra says. "So, anyway, after several conversations with Eiden, I found out that the food they were serving him was of extremely poor quality. Since I was also in charge of serving dishes, and I had access to the kitchen, I offered to sneak some better food into his cell, every once in a while, in exchange for certain rocks from the pile in his corner. At first, he thought that I wasn't being serious, and he accepted the trade, somewhat in jest. But when he actually saw me bring him the food, while holding out my hand, waiting for my hard earned prize, he looked rather shocked. I had to point several times towards the rock that I wanted before he actually gave it to me. He also seemed to be amused every time I referred to our bargains as even trades, but I'm not sure exactly why. He never told me the reason."
As Melindra talks, I suddenly remember my first conversation with Eiden, when I also offered him my own version of an 'even trade'. After hearing this story, I think I'm starting to understand a bit better why he burst out laughing like that when I made my proposition to him.

"You collect rocks?" Flower says, all of a sudden. "Do you still have them with you?"

"Why, of course!" Melindra says. "I always carry them with me. My collection has gotten a lot larger in the past six hundred years, but I still have those original rocks that I started my collection with here in my backpack. Do you want to see them?"

 "Yes!" Flower says, excited. "I'd love to!"
"Well, okay, but just so you know, I won't be slowing down my pace," Melindra says. "If you want to see them, you'll have to join my side, and I'll show them to you as we walk."

"Of course!" Flower says, as she rushes by Melindra's side.

The stillwater girl then takes off her backpack, and she begins to take out her rocks one by one, handing them over to Flower so she can get a good look at them, and then putting them back inside when she's done. As I was suspecting, none of the rocks seem to have any real marketable value, and they would look completely worthless to anyone else, but that still doesn't seem to stop Flower from marveling at every one of the rocks, while Melindra proudly explains to her the features that made her consider the stones to be worthy of her collection, making sure to also give her a brief summary of where she found each of them.

While Melindra and Flower are having their discussion, Daren gives the rest of us a signal, and we all slow down a bit to have a talk, outside of Melindra's hearing range, while still following her.

"So, what do you all think about Melindra so far?" Daren whispers, while making sure that Melindra isn't paying attention to us. "Do you think that she might be working with Eiden?"

 "I think that she's a bit stuck up, but I doubt she's a traitor."
"Yeah, Daren, I think you're overreacting," Hadrik says. "We already knew that she was friends with Eiden when we took her deal. There's no need to doubt her every step of the way."

"You're all looking at this the wrong way," Kate says. "It doesn't matter if she's trustworthy or not. As long as we don't discuss any crucial information while she's around, we'll be fine."

"It does matter, damn it!" Daren says. "If we're all just going to lag behind like this every time we need to discuss something important, it will look suspicious as hell!"

"So what?" Kate says. "Why would we care if she thinks we're suspicious?"

"Because she's a member of the team!" Daren says.

"Is she?" Kate says, raising an eyebrow.

"Listen," Daren says. "My question was whether we should trust her or not. If you're just going to say we should keep everything hidden from her, then it's the same as saying that--"

 "You know," Melindra says, as she sees us all huddled up together, far behind her and Flower, "if you're going to talk about me behind my back, you could at least TRY to do it in a less obvious way..." 
"What?" Daren says, in a painfully obvious fake tone. "No, you got it all wrong! We weren't talking about you! We were talking about... err... Flower!"

"You were?" Flower says, looking worried.

"Hey, nice save, Daren!" I say, as I pat him hard on the back. "I don't see how anyone could still think that we're being suspicious after a well thought-out explanation like that!"

"Shut up," Daren mumbles, but he doesn't say anything else.

"Listen," Melindra says, "if you all want to have your own private conversations about strategies and whatnot, it's fine, but could you at least wait until we make camp or take a break somewhere? It's annoying to have to keep a lookout for you, so you don't get lost, while I'm also monitoring the monsters that are trying to ambush us."

 "Wait, there are monsters trying to ambush us?" I say, while I quickly take off my backpack, and pull out my crossbow. "Damn it, Arraka, you had ONE job!"
"My 'job' was to tell you about invisible enemies, jackass," Arraka says. "None of these enemies are invisible. What kind of morons are you that you can't even tell when monsters are laying an ambush for you, anyway?"

"What type of monsters are we talking about?" Kate says. "And how many? They're too far away for me to be able to get a read on them with my magical sense."

"Oh, they're actually not that far away," Melindra says. "But they are all suppressing their magical auras, so it's understandable that you can't sense them approaching. I think there are about five orcs, two ogres, and two goblins. The goblins are both mages, but the others seem to be just warriors. You should be able to take them out without much trouble."

" 'You' ?" Daren asks. "Don't you mean 'we'? As in 'we', the group of people that are all travelling together, who will also be fighting these monsters together, as a team?"

"What?" Melindra says. "Of course not! Don't be ridiculous. What would be the use of bringing you all the way to Ollendor with me if you can't even beat a few monsters by yourselves? Do you have any idea what good defenses they have in that city? How else do you think their king could afford to piss off every other kingdom in Varathia without getting killed off by now?"

 "But what if the monsters kill us before we get there?" Daren says.
"Then I'd have to find somebody else to help me," Melindra says. "Someone who could kill off a few orcs without complaining so much. Listen, it's just a few monsters. It's not the end of the world. The ice mage could probably take them all out by herself. The little girl too. Even the half-lessathi could probably handle them if he invested in the right stats."

"We have names, you know..." Daren says.

"I don't know your names," Melindra says. "And besides, why would I need to know them? You're all distinguishable enough by your races and specializations that I don't need to bother to learn them."

"You're trying really hard to get on our nerves, aren't you?" Daren says.

"Why do you say that?" Melindra asks, with a genuinely puzzled expression on her face.

"Be quiet!" Kate says. "I can hear the ogres approaching from behind us. I think the orcs started advancing as well. We should be seeing them in front of us soon."

"Wow, that's impressive!" Melindra says. "You can tell all that just from the sound of their footsteps? How can you tell the difference? Is it because ogres are bigger and heavier than orcs?"

"I said be quiet!" Kate says. "If you're not going to be useful, then at least stay out of our way, and don't distract us with your talking."

 "How cold!" Melindra says. "I'm starting to wonder if there isn't actually some truth behind those myths which claim that there is a direct correlation between a mage's personality and their elemental affinity!"
"Do you ever shut up?" Kate says.

She then suddenly conjures a shield made of ice in her hand, and she places it in front of her, just in time to block an arrow that came shooting straight for her.

"For Tyrath!" shouts an orc from behind the trees, in the Common language, as he and four of his companions come rushing towards us, while roaring loudly, in unison.

All of them are green-skinned, tall as Daren, with muscular physiques, pig-like faces and fangs coming out of their mouths, just as one would expect most orcs to look like, but these ones are armed to the teeth. One of them is wielding two flaming double-edged battleaxes in his hands, another one is wielding a two-handed broadsword that is almost as big as him, and the other three are all using maces and shields that appear to be made from high quality metal.

The orc with the flaming axes seems to be the leader of the group. He is the one that shouted the first battle cry, and all of the other orcs followed his directions, as he led the charge towards us, and as he clashed directly with Daren.

"Watch out!" we see Leila's writing, in large blue letters, in front of us. "They're one of the dragon's elite squads! Do not take them lightly!"

 She then dashes behind one of the orcs that is less heavily armored, and she stabs him in the back with both her daggers. The orc roars, and he turns around, swinging his mace at her. His movements are much too slow for Leila, however, so she quickly dashes back, out of his reach, and tries to attack him again.
"Leila, behind you!" Kate shouts, as another one of the orcs tries to position himself behind Leila, in order to strike.

Kate then attempts to impale the monster with a spike made of ice that appears from the ground, in front of him. The orc manages to smash the icy spike with his enchanted mace, but he loses his momentum, and doesn't get to attack Leila anymore, who quickly slides out of his reach.

"I'll take the ogres," Hadrik says, as he rushes towards the two ogres that were trying to jump us from behind.

In the meantime, Flower engulfs one of the orcs in a pillar of fire, but he walks out of it completely unscathed, thanks to his anti-magic armor, and he starts running towards her, with his broadsword at the ready.

"Damn it!" Flower says, as she jumps out of the orc's way and rolls on the ground.

Once I get a clear shot of the orc that attacked Flower, I aim my crossbow for the narrow slit in his helm, and I pull the trigger.

The crossbow bolt hits him right in his forehead, and it passes through his skull, as the monster falls to the ground, dropping his sword.

As I make sure that the orc is dead, I suddenly realize that the two goblin mages that Melindra talked about earlier have still not made their appearance. Should I go look for them?

If I stay here, I'm probably not going to get much use out of this crossbow against those three orcs using shields, and I'd rather not risk hitting Daren and Hadrik by trying to attack the monsters that they're already busy fighting.

I could fight the orcs at close range, but would it be a good idea to let those mages unchecked? I'm going to have to think carefully about this.

My aim was a little off, and the crossbow bolt didn't go exactly where I wanted, but it still hit the monster's head, and due to the power behind the shot, it passed right through the orc's helmet and through his skull, making him stop his movements and drop to the ground like a log.

Unfortunately, I miss my shot, and the crossbow bolt bounces right off his enchanted helmet.

The orc looks pissed, and he immediately switches his target, charging towards me at breathtaking speed. I've never really fought against an enemy with such a long-ranged melee weapon before, and his sword's reach managed to take me completely off-guard.

Fortunately for me, my reflexes did not fail me, and I managed to step out of the way in time, if only just barely. I then take advantage of his loss of momentum to quickly stick my enchanted dagger through the visor of his helmet, which makes him stop his movements, and drop to the ground like a log.

I stumble out of his way clumsily, managing to avoid getting hit, but falling on my back in the process. The orc does not give me the opportunity to get back up, and he immediately swings his sword towards me, in order to finish me off.

"You idiot!" Melindra shouts, loudly, as she points her palm towards the orc that is attacking me, in order to shoot a powerful gust of wind at him.

The wind that erupts from her hand hits the orc head on, making him lose his balance and drop to the ground as well. I take advantage of the opportunity and I jump on top of him with my dagger, aiming directly for his face, and stabbing him through his helmet's visor.

Just as she is about to take the shot, the girl suddenly loses her balance, and she almost faints, just like she did earlier, after she cast that tornado. I don't get to see if she managed to regain her consciousness, because this window of opportunity was all the orc needed to swing his sword at me and to slice my head straight off my shoulders.

TEXT: 

 As I place the crossbow in my backpack, I take a quick look at the battlefield to assess the current situation. Daren seems to have his hands full, fighting the orc captain with the flaming axes. The orc appears to have completely thrown away his defense, and he is focusing on delivering relentless attacks, one after the other, in order to not give Daren the chance to retaliate. Hadrik is still fighting the ogres behind us, and from what I can see, they are giving him just as much trouble as the ogre captain from the fort, so he'll probably still be busy with them for a while.
In the meantime, Leila is fighting three orcs at once, in an attempt to keep them away from our spell casters, while Kate, Flower and Illuna are all struggling to find ways to penetrate the orcs' anti-magic armor.

"I can't believe you people!" Arraka shouts, from her amulet, as Flower tries to aim a fireball in a way that would not hit Leila, along with the orcs. "You were fighting the dragon head-on yesterday, but now you can't deal with a few of his lowly mooks? Are a bunch of anti-magic armors really all it takes to throw you into disarray?"

"Yeah, I'll have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed, here," Melindra says, as she calmly looks around her, at all the people who are fighting for their lives. "If this is how these people handle a well-organized team of reasonably-skilled combatants, I shudder to think how they will handle Ollendor's numerous teams of mercenaries."

 Melindra's monologue appears to have caught the attention of one of the orcs that was fighting Leila, because he is now heading directly for the stillwater girl, with his mace at the ready. As soon as he reaches her, the orc swings his mace hard towards her, in an attempt to bash her head in, but the girl evades his strike by floating a few inches above the ground, while pushing herself away from him with a small burst of air from the palms of her hands.
"Quit it!" Melindra shouts at the orc. "Fight them, not me! What are you, stupid?"

The orc ignores her completely, and he tries to hit her again, this time with his shield.

"I said, cut it out!" Melindra shouts at him, as she makes another jump backwards.

She then props herself into the ground with her feet, assuming a rather peculiar stance, as she bends her knees and keeps her elbows close to her body, while she faces her palms towards her attacker.

A very powerful burst of air then comes out of her hands, as the orc gets blown away, and thrown directly towards Kate, who was just about to launch an ice cone at one of Leila's opponents. Seeing the orc flying in her direction, Kate is forced to cancel her spell and to jump out of the way, in order to avoid getting knocked off her feet.

 "Are you trying to get us all killed?!" Kate shouts furiously at Melindra, as she gets back up from the ground.
"Hey, it wasn't my fault!" Melindra says. "That orc attacked me out of nowhere, when I was just minding my own business!"

"This is the middle of a battlefield, you fool!" Kate says. "If you want to mind your own business, then fly away from here and stop sabotaging us at every step!"

"Well, there's no need to be so rude about it," Melindra says, as she casts a spell, and she flies high into the air, out of the orcs' reach, while the orc that she blew away earlier goes back to fighting Leila.

She then heads into the woods, and I rush to follow her, leaving the others behind, for now. After about twenty seconds of running, for some reason, I'm feeling that we aren't making a lot of progress, and some of the trees we are passing look oddly familiar.

"What the hell are you doing?" Arraka asks us, after a while. "Are you completely incapable of running in a straight line for more than five seconds? How many times are you going to keep circling around this area before you decide to finally head towards those goblins?"

"What are you talking about?" I say. "We've been heading in the same direction this whole time."

"You've been running in circles, you moron!" Arraka says. "Do I need to draw you a map? Hold on, let me show you."

She then conjures one of her map holograms into the air, and she starts drawing a line on it, showing us the direction in which we've been going since we began heading for the goblins. The line goes into one direction for a while, but after that, the trajectory changes completely, going through the same area over and over again.

 "See?" Arraka says. "This is you. This is how stupid you looked. And do you see those two dots over there? That's where the goblins are. Now stop wasting time and get going. I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from watching you people."
I try to head into the exact direction where the goblins are drawn on Arraka's map, but for some reason, I simply can't advance further than a few steps. Every time I get too close to the goblins, I instinctively turn away from them, without realizing, and then I see myself going in the opposite direction on the map. Even worse than that is the fact that my mind gets almost completely clouded every time this happens, and it feels as if the only thing that I can think of is how I need to get away from that area, even if I don't have any actual reason to do it.

"There is a suggestion spell cast on this area," Illuna says, as she studies the area in front of us closely. "Arraka is probably not as affected by it as we are because she's inside the amulet, but the spell seems to have a similar effect to the one that Kate is using to protect our camp."

 "Wow..." I say. "I guess you weren't kidding when you said that your protection from dizziness would make me vulnerable to suggestion spells. The spell's effect on me was so strong that I could barely manage to think of anything other than getting away from that area, until I was at a far enough distance from it."
"Yes," Illuna says. "But sleep spells and dizziness spells are far more widely used than suggestion spells, so it's not that bad of a trade. Either way, we're not going to get past this area unless we get a very detailed description of the environment that those two goblins are situated in, so we can imagine that location as we move forward. Arraka, what can you tell us about the area around these goblins?"

 Before Arraka gets to answer, we hear the sound of a very loud horn, coming from the area where all of our friends were fighting, and only a few seconds afterwards, the two dots representing the goblins disappear from Arraka's map, along with the auras of all the orcs and the ogres from the battlefield.
"Well," Illuna says, "at least now we know what the goblins were there for. One of them was maintaining the suggestion spell, while the other one laid in wait, in a secluded place where he could not be disturbed, in case he needed to concentrate on casting the teleportation spell, after receiving the signal to retreat."

"Let's get back to the others," I say. "Hopefully, everyone is alright."

As we get back to the area where all the fighting took place, we soon find out that not everyone had managed to walk out of the conflict completely unscathed. Leila is now lying on the ground, with her left ankle red and swollen, as Daren is kneeling beside her, while holding his hands slightly above her wound, with a bright white light coming out of them.

"You just need to bear with this for a little longer," Daren says, as he sees Leila grimacing from the pain, without making any sounds. "The healing spell is almost done."

"Gods, what happened here?" Flower says.

 "Leila managed to kill two of the orcs she was fighting by herself," Daren says, "but the third one crushed her leg with his mace before she got the time to retreat. At least this gave Kate the opening she needed to aim one of her ice cones through the open slit in his helm, in order to finish him off, but the wound that Leila took was no joke. It looks much better now than it did before. Anyway, after the three orcs got killed, their captain jumped away from me and he blew in his horn, to sound the retreat. What happened to the goblins? Did they get away along with the other monsters?"
"Yes," Illuna says. "We didn't manage to reach them in time because they had a suggestion spell that was keeping us away from them. They got the signal to retreat before we could find a way to get around the spell's effects."

"But where did they go?" Hadrik says. "Are they planning to ambush us again?"

"Nah," Arraka says. "They're gone. If I can't sense them, then they've probably retreated back to their main headquarters. Wherever that is."

"There, it's healed," Daren says, as Leila's ankle goes back to its normal color and size. "But not completely. You shouldn't try any more acrobatic stunts for at least a day, until you fully recover. You should be able to walk without much trouble, though."

"Thank you..." Leila writes, as she gets up from the ground.

"Flower! Illuna!" I say. "Could you go see why the two goblin mages haven't attacked us yet? You should be able to find where they're hiding, with a little help from Arraka."

"Oh, right, the goblins!" Flower says. "I completely forgot about them. I think I may have actually sensed one of them cast a spell when the orcs attacked us. Come on, Petal. It was this way!"

Not long after Flower and Illuna disappear into the woods, I decide that it's time to finally make my move.

I pull my scimitar out of its sheath, and I hurry towards one of the trees surrounding our area. I then use my weapon to cut the tree in a single movement, and just as the tree begins to fall to the ground, I sheathe my blade and I grab the tree with both my hands, in order to use it as my new weapon.

As I take a look towards the three orcs that were fighting Leila, all of the combatants from the battleground seem to have briefly stopped fighting, to look towards me, with shocked expressions on their faces. I take advantage of their momentary bewilderment to make a dash towards the three orcs with the maces, and I immediately crush one of them underneath the weight of the tree's trunk.

"Leila, step away from the orcs," I say.

 Leila complies right away, and she puts as much distance as she can between herself and the two remaining mace-wielding orcs, although one of them immediately begins to follow her. I swing my tree like a club, and I hit the orc that stayed behind from the side, completely crushing his internal organs, and killing him before he hits the ground. Seeing that there is only one orc left aside from the captain, Leila stops moving away from the battlefield, and she dashes straight for her pursuer, slicing his neck wide open, without giving him any time to react.
"HAHAHAHA!" Hadrik laughs, all of a sudden. "What a great idea! Why didn't I think of that?"

He then dashes towards a tree behind him and he pulls it straight out of the ground, roots and all. As soon as he acquires his new weapon, Hadrik tries to squash one of the ogres underneath its weight, but the monster simply blocks the tree with his club, as the force of the blow pushes him one foot into the ground. 

"Daren, you might want to move away from there..." I say, as Daren jumps away from the orc captain, and I swing my tree at him, in an attempt to squash him like I did with his companions.

 The orc does not let himself get intimidated, and he swings his flaming axes so fast that he cuts my tree into six pieces before it even reaches him. As the now burning pieces of wood fall on the ground beside him, the orc is looking straight at me, with a very pissed off look on his face.
"Damn..." I say, as I look at the big chunk of wood that I still have left in my hands.

Instead of engaging me, however, the orc captain reaches for a horn that he was wearing around his neck, and he blows in it as loud as he can. As soon as he does this, the ogres step back from Hadrik, and a very bright white light begins to engulf all of the monsters, while their bodies start to vibrate loudly.

I specifically target the orc that had already been injured by Leila, and I make a quick dash towards him, not giving him the time to turn around and defend himself, as I drive my dagger straight through his heart and kill him while he's still standing.

Luckily for me, his posture gives away his true intentions, and I manage to call his bluff, as I completely ignore his mace, and focus solely on his shield. Just as I guessed, the orc tries to bash my head in with his shield as soon as he gets near me, but I step out of the way at the very last second, making him lose his balance, which allows me to deliver a swift and lethal blow with my blade to the back of his neck.

Being left with only one enemy to fight, Leila immediately goes on the offensive, and she easily manages to dispose of him, by getting in his blind spot, and then assassinating him with a single blow to the side of his head.

When he sees what happened with his underlings, the orc captain pushes Daren away from him, he takes a few steps back, he reaches for a horn that he was wearing around his neck, and he blows in it as loud as he can.

 "Crap, they're getting away!" Daren says, as he rushes towards the captain, but it is too late.
Mere seconds after the white light appears, the orc and the ogres get teleported out of the area, quite likely alongside the two goblins that were hiding in the forest until now.

"So that's what the goblins were doing," Kate says. "They didn't join the battle because they needed to be calm and collected, in order to be able to cast the teleportation spell if there was a need to retreat."

"Where are the orcs?" Flower says, all of a sudden, as she appears from behind the trees. "Did they manage to get away? Oh, you've killed the three with the shields and maces..."

"Their captain still got away, though," Illuna says. "And so did the ogres, by the looks of it."

"What happened to the goblins?" I say. "Didn't you manage to reach them in time?"

 "No," Illuna answers me. "One of the goblins had cast a suggestion spell similar to the one Kate is using to keep enemies away from our camp. The spell wouldn't let us get near them unless we knew their exact location, because we needed to focus on it while heading towards them. We tried to get Arraka to describe the scenery around them for us, but it took too long, and they eventually teleported out of the area."
"So, where did they go?" I say. "Are they planning to ambush us again?"

"I doubt it," Illuna says. "From what Arraka told us, she can no longer sense any monsters around us, and given the relatively wide area she can cover with her magic sense, I am suspecting that the monsters went back to their main headquarters for now."

 "Crap, they're getting away!" Daren says, as he rushes towards the captain, but it is too late.
Mere seconds after the white light appears, the orc and the ogres get teleported out of the area, quite likely alongside the two goblins that were hiding in the forest until now.

"So that's what the goblins were doing," Kate says. "They didn't join the battle because they needed to be calm and collected, in order to be able to cast the teleportation spell if there was a need to retreat."

"Where are the orcs?" Flower says, all of a sudden, as she appears from behind the trees. "Did they manage to get away? Oh, you've killed the three with the shields and maces..."

"Their captain still got away, though," Illuna says. "And so did the ogres, by the looks of it."

"What happened to the goblins?" I say. "Didn't you manage to reach them in time?"

"Whoa..." Flower says, as she suddenly sees me holding the tree trunk in my hands, and she instinctively takes a step back.

 "No," Illuna answers me. "One of the goblins had cast a suggestion spell similar to the one Kate is using to keep enemies away from our camp. The spell wouldn't let us get near them unless we knew their exact location, because we needed to focus on it while heading towards them. We tried to get Arraka to describe the scenery around them for us, but it took too long, and they eventually teleported out of the area."
"So, where did they go?" I say. "Are they planning to ambush us again?"

"I doubt it," Illuna says. "From what Arraka told us, she can no longer sense any monsters around us, and given the relatively wide area she can cover with her magic sense, I am suspecting that the monsters went back to their main headquarters for now."

"Guys, guys, I know we're all having fun using trees as clubs and all," Daren says, "but could you please drop those trees, now? You're making me nervous."

"Oh, right, sure," Hadrik and I say in unison, as we both toss our trees to the side.

 "Also, I'd really appreciate it if you avoided using trees as weapons from now on," Daren says. "It's hard enough to focus on all the enemies at once without having to also look out for where you guys are swinging those huge oversized clubs with hundreds of branches on top of them."
"Oh, yeah, don't worry about it!" Hadrik says. "This was just for fun. I fight much better without using weapons."

"I'm not going to lie, though, Barry," Daren says. "That was pretty impressive."

"Hey, thanks!" I say. "You weren't half-bad yourself!"

 "Man, those ogres that I fought earlier were quite something!" Hadrik says. "I had almost as much trouble with them as I had with that ogre captain from the fort. It's a shame that they got away, though. That orc captain seemed to know his stuff too, judging by how long he could hold a stalemate with Daren."
"Yeah," I say. "This is the first time when we ran into monsters that were so strong and so well-organized. Leila, you said earlier that these were one of Tyrath's elite squads?"

"Yes," Leila writes. "He usually only dispatches these teams for special missions. I'm guessing that this particular group was sent here specifically to target you guys, since he could no longer kill you personally, due to his pact with Eiden. He must have sent at least one elite group to guard each of the city's exits, but they couldn't stay too close to the city gates, without being detected, so they made their ambush here, in the forest."

"No," Leila writes. "I do not know exactly what kind of members they have in each group, but I'm pretty sure that they also have groups with wyvern riders, and some of them also have trolls with very high regenerative abilities."

"Regardless of what team Tyrath decides to send after us next," Illuna says, "what is most important is that we detect them before they actually have us surrounded. Arraka, from now on, you will also let us know when there are groups of monsters trying to ambush us, not just invisible enemies. Do you understand?"

"Hey, if you want my help, then how about you fight seriously, next time, huh?" Arraka says. "What was with that ridiculous performance of yours in the fight from earlier? Why didn't you use that drowning technique that I taught you on them, like you did yesterday on the dragon? It's not like their anti-magic helmets would have prevented them from breathing water into their lungs."

 "I've already told you countless times," Illuna says. "I never managed to fully control that technique. What I did yesterday was a gamble, and I only did it because we were running out of options. And even so, I had to time my spell perfectly, so I'd cast it exactly as the dragon inhaled, when he was preparing to breathe his fire. This way, Tyrath's lungs were already full of water before he could react. If he had any air left in his lungs, he could have simply blown some air out of his mouth, and my water bubble would have dispersed into thin air. That's how little control I have over this spell. And aside from this, I can only cast it on one person at a time, and if someone breaks my concentration while I cast it, the spell will be undone in an instant."
"Well then, why don't you master it?" Arraka says. "Why did I waste my time teaching you such a useful technique if you're not even going to practice using it? Do you really hate me so much that you are willing to limit your spell arsenal just to spite me?"

"Fine!" Illuna says. "If it will make you shut up, then I will start practicing the spell! Now, will you agree to warn us about monster attacks, or not?"

"Of course, of course..." Arraka says. "After all, it's also in my best interest that you two remain alive... at least until I manage to take control of your body."

 "Does Tyrath have any teams that are stronger than these elite squads?"
"He used to," Leila writes. "But I don't think he has them anymore. I heard that there was a time when he actually had teams of dragons under his rule. But this was likely before he became unable to maintain his molten lava form at all times. From what I understand, the dragons in Varathia now live isolated, somewhere in the mountains, and they don't want to have anything to do with Tyrath, despite his claims of being the 'king of all dragons'."

 "Say, Daren..." I say, as I look at one of the dead orcs in front of me. "The armor that you're wearing right now is anti-magic armor, correct?"
"Among other things, yes," Daren says.

"So, why aren't you also wearing a helmet to go with the set?" I say. "You saw how useful these anti-magic helmets were for the orcs just now. And if you're already willing to wear full heavy armor, a helmet isn't exactly going to weigh you down a lot more, is it?"

"It's not about the weight," Daren says. "It's about being aware of my surroundings. These mindless brutes might be okay with losing their peripheral vision over some extra defense, but when you're on a battlefield with enemies coming from every side, limiting your vision is the last thing any sane person would want to do! Then there's also the fact that this scar I have on my forehead makes me easily recognizable to most people nowadays, and when people recognize me, they usually tend to get intimidated, and not engage me in battle, which helps avoid some unnecessary bloodshed."

"How did you get that scar, anyway?" Hadrik says. "I've never asked. And why is it shaped like an 'x'? Is there like a monster with an 'x' shaped tail that I don't know about, or something?"

"No," Daren says. "The 'x' is actually formed from two separate scars that I got during the same battle."

 "Oh?" Hadrik asks, suddenly getting more interested. "Someone was actually strong enough to scar the great hero Daren twice during the same battle? May I ask who this was?"
"It was my martial arts and enchanting master," Daren says. "An ex-sage from the Southern Continent. Well, he wasn't a sage back when he was training me, but he became one afterwards, and he lost the title in the next year. He was an extremely harsh teacher, especially when it came to martial arts, and he was the type that always tried to make you learn lessons from your own experience, rather than just giving you the answer himself. As his final lesson, he told me to fight him with all my strength, by using everything he's ever taught me. This is when I got my two scars. The first time he wounded me, I did not understand his lesson, so he decided to cut me a second time, in the exact same spot, from the opposite side, in order to properly get his point across. Only then, did I realize that the whole purpose of that battle was to show me a huge weakness in my fighting style that I'd ignored for years, without giving it much thought. The third time when he attacked me in the same spot, I was ready for him, and I quickly disarmed him, which concluded my last lesson. Now, every time I see my reflection in the water, it reminds me to always remain vigilant, and to always look out for even the tiniest of weaknesses, because in a real battle, they can mean the difference between life and death."

 "Huh..." Hadrik says. "That's actually oddly inspiring. I think I may also have some of these small weaknesses that I never really bothered to correct because I didn't consider them to be that big of a problem, due to my durable giant skin, but after hearing your story, I'm thinking that maybe I should get off my arse and actually do something about it, before it's too late.

 "Hey!" Melindra suddenly shouts, from high above us. "So... are you guys done with your secret strategy meeting, yet? You think maybe I can come back down so we can continue our trip? No pressure, though. Take as long as you like."
"What are you--" Daren starts to say, as he looks towards Melindra, but he interrupts himself. "Ugh... Yes, Melindra, you can come down, now."

"Splendid," Melindra says, as she dives down towards us, reaching the ground level in a few seconds. "Just so you know, the battle you had just now with the monsters was far below my expectations. You're going to have to clean up your act if you actually plan to be of any use to me when we get to Ollendor."

"Listen, Melindra..." Daren says. "You may have taken an oath to uphold your end of the bargain, but none of us took an oath to fulfill ours. You may have forgotten about this, but we can still cancel this deal at any time, if we don't want to work with you anymore. And with the way you've been acting so far, you've given us some pretty good reasons to reconsider our arrangement. So, I'll tell you what we'll do. If you still want us to help you with Ollendor, then you can stop complaining and lead us to where we need to go. If you don't, then I'm afraid you might have to go looking for some other group to do your dirty work."

 "Fine!" Melindra says, frowning. "If that's how it's going to be, then you won't hear another word from me."
She then storms in front of us, and we all begin to follow her, one by one, into the depths of the forest. 

"So, uh..." I say, as we all walk behind Melindra. "Illuna, do you think those two goblins might have been part of Fyron's army? Could the goblin general be working with the dragon, now?"

"I highly doubt it," Illuna says. "The dragon already has plenty of goblins under his rule. He shouldn't have any need for Fyron and his 'free' goblins. In fact, the only reason why Fyron and his group have survived for so long is most likely because the dragon doesn't really care about them. There is no pact protecting goblins, so Tyrath could very well destroy their whole camp by himself if he deemed it worthy of his time, and nobody would be able to stop him."

ID: B2-Ch08a-Serve
TEXT: 

 "Did Fyron ever serve under the dragon, before he joined the free goblins?"
"Yes, he did," Illuna says. "A long time ago. From what I understood, he left because of the very poor way in which the goblins were being treated by the dragon, and by the other monster races. They may be the most resourceful of the monster races, but physically, they are by far the weakest, and there aren't many mages born in their race either. As such, the goblins were always being forced to perform menial tasks, they were ridiculed by the other monster races, and they were almost always on the verge of starvation. When Fyron left Tyrath's army, and took his goblins with him, the dragon never bothered to stop them, because they were mostly irrelevant to him, and so, the goblins formed a new faction, calling themselves the 'free goblins'. Only a fraction of the goblins actually followed Fyron, though. Most of them preferred to stay behind, because at least the dragon would ensure their protection against animals and humans, and he would give them enough food to scrape by. Even some of the goblins that left with Fyron decided later to return to the dragon, due to the even poorer conditions that they were getting in Fyron's camp.  However, those who decided to stay, eventually managed to make a better life for themselves than they used to have, after a few long years of hard work and effort, and in time, they managed to get other goblins, and even other types of monsters to willingly join their camp."

 "Hold on a minute, there," Daren says. "Who exactly is this Fyron, and why are you both acting like you've met him before?"
"Fyron is the general of the free goblins of Varathia," Illuna says.

"Okay, and how do you guys know him?" Daren says.

"Illuna has known him since before she met us, I think," I say. "I met him while I was walking around the underground tunnels of the arena with Leila, trying to sabotage the event."

"You were trying to sabotage the--" Daren says, shocked, but he stops mid-sentence, and he shakes his head. "Oh, boy... Nothing is ever simple with you, is it, Barry?"

"So..." Hadrik says. "I don't mean to interrupt your discussion or anything, but shouldn't we be getting a little worried about these well-trained groups of monsters going after our heads? I mean, even I was having trouble with those ogres, and from what I've seen, our spell-casters had almost no effect on the orcs that were wearing anti-magic armor. Maybe we need to rethink our strategies, a bit?"

"Well," Kate says, "maybe the battle would have gone better if a certain member of the group didn't ignore the fight completely..."

 "How many types of monsters does Tyrath have under his rule, exactly?"
"I do not know all the details," Illuna says, "but as far as I'm aware, the monsters that are by far the most loyal to the dragon are the orcs. They are not as strong as the ogres, but they're not dumb like them, either, and they are generally more powerful than most humans. The orcs are the main force of the dragon's army, but he also has other monsters of the humanoid variety like ogres, trolls and goblins, alongside various creatures such as wyverns and hydras. While it would be pretty unlikely to meet an orc in Varathia that does not serve Tyrath, there are plenty of ogres that have nothing to do with the dragon, like the ones we fought in the fort, and the trolls are mostly a race of mercenaries, so their allegiance to the dragon is fickle. As far as the goblins go, I'd wager that most of the goblins in Varathia still follow Tyrath, although Fyron has also been getting some new recruits in his camp, lately."

 "Hold on a minute, there," Daren says. "Who exactly is this Fyron, and why are you both acting like you've met him before?"

 "Drop it, Kate," Daren says. "This discussion won't get us anywhere. And besides, Melindra won't be part of our group forever. Hadrik is right. We need new plans. I was way too focused on my fight with the orc captain to be able to pay attention to my surroundings, so I can't say for certain, but I think that one of the main problems in the way we organized ourselves was the fact that Leila jumped in to attack all those orcs by herself, which forced all of our spell-casters to concentrate only on the orcs that were fighting her, instead of say... dealing with the ogres, who did not appear to be wearing anti-magic armor, and who would have been easier targets for them."
"Sorry..." Leila writes.

"Oh, there's no need for you to apologize!" Daren says. "I know that you were trying to act as a decoy, in order to keep the attention off our elementalists, and that's a great tactic, but it just didn't work well for this situation. That's why we're having this discussion, in order to learn from our mistakes, and to improve our tactics for later battles. For example, maybe the next time you want to act as a decoy, you could try to keep your distance from your enemies, instead of actually engaging them in battle, so that you wouldn't put yourself into any immediate danger, which would allow our casters to also pay attention to the rest of the battlefield, without feeling obligated to jump to your aid."

"Okay, I'll try..." Leila writes.

 "Also," Daren says, "the next time Hadrik says he'll 'handle the ogres', it doesn't mean that you need to let him handle them all by himself. He may be strong enough to not get himself killed, but if either one of you helped him kill those ogres, he could have made mincemeat out of the orcs, without breaking a sweat. And when I say either one of you, I'm talking especially about you, Kate. A few well-placed ice cones should have been enough to finish off those ogres, given how busy they were with fighting Hadrik. I know that Leila is your friend, but you can't just completely ignore your surroundings every time she is in danger. If we're going to fight as a team from now on, you're going to need to put a little more faith in her fighting capabilities."
"I understand..." Kate says.

"Hmm?..." Melindra says, as she turns around, suddenly appearing to gain an interest in our conversation. "That is some very good advice coming from someone who hasn't been paying attention to his surroundings. Maybe I've been underestimating you a little bit..."

"Of course it's good advice," Daren says. "I haven't spent the last twenty years fighting monsters for nothing. Also, didn't you say earlier that we wouldn't hear another word from you? Why are you talking to us all of a sudden?"

"Hmph!" Melindra says, as she turns around. "I wasn't talking to you. I was just thinking out loud. There's no reason for me to talk to any of you people."

 "Does this mean that you won't show me your rock collection anymore?" Flower says, with a disappointed tone in her voice.
"Well..." Melindra says. "I suppose I could make an exception. Just this once. Come here, and we'll pick up from where we left off."

As Flower rushes again to Melindra's side, we all continue our journey through the forest, and for the next few hours, we do not get any more interruptions. For the duration of our journey, Melindra has not spoken again to anyone other than Flower, and the rest of us mostly ignored her as well. While we walked, we sort of split ourselves into little groups, with Kate and Leila in the back, Hadrik, Daren and I in the middle, and Flower and Melindra in the front. It seemed that Kate and Leila had a lot of catching up to do, so we decided to not bother them, and to let them have a little privacy. 

On the opposite side of the group, once Melindra had finished showing Flower the rocks, she began to ask her a lot of technical details about how her fusion with Illuna actually works. Some of the questions were more personal than others, but it didn't seem like Flower was being bothered by them in any way, and she answered them all without hesitation, while Melindra was eying her with a look of sincere and eager curiosity. 

 When it got past noon, we decided to have a break near a river, in order to eat some meals, fill our gourds with fresh water and gather some fruits, so that Flower could conserve some of her magical energy by not creating food every time we needed to eat something. It would have been nice if the water that Illuna conjures were actually drinkable, because then we wouldn't have to worry about finding sources of fresh water, but from what she told me, the water that she creates with her spells disappears by itself after a while, so we might as well be drinking empty air.
After I finished eating, I sat down on a rock, and I pulled out my notebook, to see if I could find any more of Eiden's loopholes while we were resting. While I was calmly flipping the pages of my notebook, I could see with the tail of my eye how Melindra was slowly closing in on me, although she seemed to have conflicting feelings about whether she wanted to talk to me or not, and she went back and forth a few times, before she finally decided to stop in front of me.

"So, uhm... Barry... was it?" Melindra says, with an obviously forced smile, while attempting to appear cute and approachable. "How are you this fine day?"

"I see that you've finally bothered to learn my name," I say, as I casually flip a page from my notebook, without raising my eyes to look at her.

"Yes, your name is easier to remember than the others," Melindra says.

 "It is, indeed," I say, still not taking my eyes off my notebook.
After I'm done talking, there is a short period of silence, during which I flip another one of the notebook's pages.

"So, anyway," Melindra says, "I was curious about something. I know that you're a half-lessathi, and I also know that you came here as a participant in the tournament, but as far as I'm aware, lessathi can normally only be found in the continent of Varathia. So, I was wondering who your parents are, exactly, and why did they leave this continent?"

"If you're talking about my real parents, then I most likely never met them," I say. "I'm pretty sure that the parents who actually raised me were both regular humans."

"They 'were' regular humans?" Melindra says, intrigued. "Not 'are'?"

"No," I say, simply. "They're dead now. They were killed by a banshee."

As I say these words, Daren, who was sitting on a rock not far from me, sharpening his sword, now seems to be paying a little more attention to our discussion. I suddenly realize that I never really told him how I met my first banshee.

"Killed by a banshee?" Melindra says. "And you weren't there when this happened?"

"I was there," I say. "I'm the one who killed her."

 "You killed a banshee by yourself?" Melindra says. "But the only way someone as powerless as you could ever hope to defeat a banshee would be to attack her in her most vulnerable state, right after the awakening. Which means..."
She pauses for a second, as realization dawns upon her.

"Which means that the person who turned into a banshee was also part of your family, wasn't she?" Melindra says. "Your sister, perhaps? Cousin?"

"Sister," I say.

"And you killed her with your own hands?" Melindra asks, with a look of morbid curiosity in her eyes. "How did the banshee look when she awakened? Did she really look like a genuine monster, like they say in the legends? What about your sister? Did it seem like she was still retaining a part of her consciousness, before the awakening process was over, or was she completely gone?"

 "Listen, Melindra," I say, as I close my notebook and finally look her in the eyes. "If we're going to be delving into subjects that we're uncomfortable to talk about, then I also have a few questions for you..."
I then lower my voice, in order to make sure that Daren can no longer hear me talking.

"For starters," I say, "why did you lie to us when you said that the reason why you weren't helping us fight the orcs earlier was because you wanted to test us?"

"And you killed her with your own hands?" Melindra asks, with a look of morbid curiosity in her eyes. "How did the banshee look when she awakened? Did she really look like a genuine monster, like they say in the legends? What about your sister? Did it seem like she was still retaining a part of her consciousness, before the awakening process was over, or was she completely gone?"

 "Listen, Melindra," I say, as I close my notebook and finally look her in the eyes. "If we're going to be delving into subjects that we're uncomfortable to talk about, then I also have a few questions for you..."
I then lower my voice, in order to make sure that Daren can no longer hear me talking.

"For starters," I say, "why did you lie to us when you said that the reason why you weren't helping us fight the orcs earlier was because you wanted to test us?"

 "That's funny... Because you were calling me 'half-lessathi' just a few hours ago..." I say, still not taking my eyes off my notebook.
"Oh..." Melindra says. "Well, back then it was harder for me to remember it, but now it isn't."

"Because now you need to ask a favor of me, but back then you didn't?" I ask her.

"Yes, exactly!" Melindra says. "I'm glad to know that we're both on the same page, here!"

"You and me both," I say, as I flip another page of my notebook.

"So, anyway," Melindra says, "I was curious about something. I know that you're a half-lessathi, and I also know that you came here as a participant in the tournament, but as far as I'm aware, lessathi can normally only be found in the continent of Varathia. So, I was wondering who your parents are, exactly, and why did they leave this continent?"

"If you're talking about my real parents, then I most likely never met them," I say. "I'm pretty sure that the parents who actually raised me were both regular humans."

"They 'were' regular humans?" Melindra says, intrigued. "Not 'are'?"

"No," I say, simply. "They're dead now. They were killed by a banshee."

 As I say these words, Daren, who was sitting on a rock not far from me, sharpening his sword, now seems to be paying a little more attention to our discussion. I suddenly realize that I never really told him how I met my first banshee.
"Killed by a banshee?" Melindra says. "And you weren't there when this happened?"

"I was there," I say. "I'm the one who killed her."

"You killed a banshee by yourself?" Melindra says. "But the only way someone as powerless as you could ever hope to defeat a banshee would be to attack her in her most vulnerable state, right after the awakening. Which means..."

She pauses for a second, as realization dawns upon her.

"Which means that the person who turned into a banshee was also part of your family, wasn't she?" Melindra says. "Your sister, perhaps? Cousin?"

"Sister," I say.

"And you killed her with your own hands?" Melindra asks, with a look of morbid curiosity in her eyes. "How did the banshee look when she awakened?

 "Oh?" Melindra says, with the smile of a child who's just found a new toy to play with. "So, you find me unlikeable, do you?"
"Quite unlikeable, yes," I say.

"And you don't enjoy talking to me?" Melindra says.

"Not really, no," I say.

"Well, in that case, I see no other alternative than to keep pestering you until you'll begin to find me likeable," Melindra says, with a coy smile.

"That's not how these things work," I say.

"What are you talking about?" Melindra says, still smiling. "Of course that's how it works. You're a half-lessathi, I'm a half-lessathi, we're both half-lessathi. What possible reason could you have to dislike me?"

"Oh, I don't know..." I say. "Maybe your personality?"

"Hey, Melindra," Daren says, as he closes in on us. "We're all ready to go. Can you show us the way?"

 "Oh, sure," Melindra says. "Just follow the river in that direction for a while, and you'll be fine. We'll catch up to you in a second."
"Uh... okay, I guess?..." Daren says, and then he turns to the others. "Well, you all heard her. Let's follow the river."

Daren and the rest of the group then grab their backpacks, preparing to leave, and as they go past us, I can see Kate glancing at us a little suspiciously.

"So, about your parents--" Melindra starts to say, but I don't wait for her to finish her sentence, and I go to follow the others, while I put my notebook back in my backpack.

"Hey, I wasn't done talking, yet!" Melindra says, as she hurries to my side.

"Oh, you weren't?" I say, in a dry tone. "Sorry, I wasn't listening."

"Well, in that case, I accept your apology," Melindra says, seemingly oblivious to the sarcastic undertone of my previous remark. "So, anyway, I think that one of your parents might have been part of the lessathi top brass, or at least related to them in some way."

 "You really weren't kidding about pestering me, were you?"
"Hey, do you want to find out more about your parents or not?" Melindra says.

"I couldn't care less about my real parents, actually," I say.

"Okay, fine!" Melindra says, with a pout, as she crosses her arms. "If you don't want to hear about them, then I'm not going to tell you anything."

"Good," I say.

We then both walk in silence for a few more seconds, as we catch up to the others.

"So, about that banshee..." Melindra says.

"Are you serious?" I ask her.

"What?" Melindra says. "I was just curious."

"Well, don't be curious," I tell her. "Don't you have anything better to do than to annoy me?"

"Well, obviously, I don't, because if I did, I wouldn't be annoying you, would I?" Melindra says.

 "Can you two stop talking and focus for a second, here?" Daren says. "I can sense a group of mages approaching us. And I'm not sure if they're friendly. Keep your guards up."
It takes a while before the mages show themselves, but it would appear that they are yet another group of weapon enchanters. They don't really look like thugs, so who knows, maybe this time we can just say hello and then be on our way, like civilized people. I know that I'm being optimistic here, but still...

"Hey, look at that!" one of the weapon enchanters says. "These bozos have brought whores with them to the tournament."

"Wow, you're right," says a second mage. "They even made sure to bring at least one for each of them."

"Do you think that the little girl was brought by the dwarf?" says a third mage. "That sick bastard."

All of a sudden, Melindra grabs my arm with both her hands, and she presses herself against me.

"Darling, are you going to just let them talk about me like that?" Melindra says, with pleading eyes, but with a mocking smile. "You're not going to let them walk away after calling me a whore, are you?"

}
#if(v_b2_ch8_parents == 1) {
 "What makes you say that?"
"Well, marrying a non-lessathi is strictly prohibited in today's lessathi society," Melindra says. "So it stands to reason that any such relationships will remain hidden from the eyes of the other lessathi. This is the reason why you don't really see any more half-lessathi nowadays. However, if a lessathi woman were to become pregnant with the child of a non-lessathi, such a relationship would become much more difficult to hide. I'm thinking that the reason why your parents left this continent was because they considered it would have been too difficult to keep hiding after your mother became pregnant with you."

"Okay, but why would they be related to the top brass?" I say.

"Because the only people that have access to teleporting devices on this continent are the kings and the lessathi," Melindra says. "And those teleporters are the only way to leave the continent. Since only the highest ranked lessathi have access to the lessathi teleporters, it means that your mother needed to ask help from one of them, if she wanted to leave, and they would need to do it secretly. Maybe you're even related to the leader of the lessathi! I'm guessing you were born around thirty years or so ago, so the leader back then would have been... Heksol. Yeah, that was the name. I think he might have died since then, though. Or was he killed? I'm not sure. I don't really follow lessathi politics that much anymore." 

"Can you two stop talking and focus for a second, here?" Daren says. "I can sense a group of mages approaching us. And I'm not sure if they're friendly. Keep your guards up."

 When I turn my head around, I notice that Kate is currently staring at Melindra, with a shocked expression on her face.
"Hmm?..." Melindra says, with an intrigued look in her eyes, as soon as she sees Kate staring at her.

She then squeezes my arm even harder, while she's still looking at Kate, to see her reaction. Once Kate realizes what Melindra is doing, she turns her face away, in disgust.

"Hmm..." Melindra says, this time with a smile.

"Don't worry, love," the first mage tells Melindra. "We're not walking away anywhere. At least not until you guys empty your pockets and your backpacks, to show us if you have any pinecones with you..."

"Are you serious?" Daren says, almost breaking into a laugh while saying that last word.

"Heh," Hadrik says. "I guess not every mage in the world can recognize you by your scar, eh, Daren?"

"That or they don't care," Illuna says. "They were mad enough to join this tournament, after all."

"We don't have time for this," Kate says, as she stops hiding her aura, and she shoots three ice daggers in front of the first mage's feet.

 "Aaah!" the mage screams like a little girl, with a terrified look in his eyes, as he finally understands the situation he's in. "A banshee! It's a banshee! What are you guys still standing here for? Run for your lives, you idiots! Run as fast as your feet can carry you!"
He then jumps over the small river, and he heads into the forest, as all of his companions hurry to follow their leader.

"Are you going to let go of my arm, now?" I ask Melindra.

"Of course, of course!" Melindra says, as she casually releases my arm. "There's no need to be so upset. It was only a joke!"

"That's lovely," I say. "Now how about you take the lead, like before, and leave me alone?"

"Will you come and walk by my side if I go take the lead?" Melindra says.

"I will do no such thing," I say.

"Then I'll stay here, thank you very much," Melindra says.

"Woah..." Hadrik says, with a grin, as he looks towards us. "Did something happen during that break we took earlier, Barry? Do you have anything that you might want to tell us?"

"Shut up," I tell him.

"Leave them alone," Daren tells Hadrik. "I'm sure that Melindra will get bored eventually, and then things will go back to normal. We already know the direction that we need to go in, so we don't need a guide for now. Come on, follow me."

 Just like Daren said, after about an hour or two of walking, Melindra finally got bored of pestering me, and she went to talk with Flower, who appears to be the only member of the team that she actually gets along with, so far. We spent the rest of the day travelling, without getting into any more fights, although we did run into several groups of mages, who seemed to be very busy gathering pinecones from trees, and stuffing them into their backpacks.
When we decided that it was finally time to make camp, we started placing our tents not too far away from the river that we'd been following since noon. Melindra didn't really seem to want to spend time with our group any longer than she needed to, so as soon as she was done leading us, she went to the river bank, to see if she could find some more rocks to add to her collection.

As soon as we were done setting up the tents, I immediately pulled out my notebook, because there were a few things that I wanted to check before going to sleep. While I flip through the pages, I suddenly notice an old page where I wrote some notes about the stat device, and one particular phrase catches my attention. According to my old data, the stat booster was supposed to gather more energy from the air, if powerful spells were cast around it, but I've never actually seen this happen since I came to Varathia. Realizing that I may need more info on the subject, I decide to go ask some questions to the only other person in the camp that has more knowledge of stat devices than me.

 As I go over to Leila, I notice that she was still in the middle of a conversation with Kate.
"Hey, Leila," I say. "Got a minute? There was something I wanted to ask you about your stat device."

"Of course..." Leila writes.

"Since when were you the studious type?" Kate asks me, while raising an eyebrow, after seeing the notebook that I'm still holding in my hands. "I've never seen you use that notebook before, but now you seem to be reading from it all the time."

"Oh, I used to write in this notebook every day before coming to Varathia," I say. "It's just that I kind of had to put that hobby to the side, for a while, because I was too busy fighting for my life in this godforsaken place."

"You were going to ask me something about the stats?" Leila writes.

 "Yeah," I say. "I wanted to know if you've ever felt like your stat device was receiving more energy from the air after a big mage fight had occurred in your vicinity."
"Not in particular, no," Leila writes. "I mean, we just had that big fight with the dragon, yesterday, and neither of us got any stat points."

"Yes, exactly!" I say. "But according to the data I'd gathered before coming here, the stat device should not be gathering the energy selectively. And yet, I don't remember ever getting stat points after participating in a mage battle. Do you know why this might be happening?"

"I don't know," Leila writes. "I haven't really thought about it that much..."

"Well, I have a theory," I say, "but I'm not exactly sure how accurate it is. You see, there was a time when I got to temporarily activate my hidden magical stats, but I only got the option to do it because there was a great amount of magical energy in the air around me at that time. The fact that the makers of the stat device included an option to quickly burn through the available energy makes me think that the energy would have been wasted otherwise, because the device wouldn't have been able to convert it all into stat points fast enough. Do you understand what I'm getting at?"

 "Yes," Leila writes. "The energy residue from spells does not stay in the air very long after they've been cast. So, if the stat device cannot convert the energy fast enough, and if it does not have enough capacity to store it for later use, this would mean that in reality, most of the energy that the device is getting is not from spells, but from mage auras."
"That's what I was thinking," I say. "But since the device can only extract a very low amount of energy from each person's aura at a time, this means that what really matters is not how powerful the people are, but how many mages there are within the stat booster's radius, which, if I'm not mistaken, should be around thirty miles, give or take. There would likely need to be hundreds of mages within the device's range, for the conversion to stat points to have any noticeable effect. That would sort of explain why the number of points I've been receiving have slowed down, lately, because a lot of mages have died since the beginning of this tournament, but it still wouldn't explain why we've been receiving fewer points while we were in the city."

"Maybe it's because there were other people with stat devices gathered in Thilias," Kate says. "Surely, you couldn't have been the only person to come up with the idea of bringing one with you to this place. And if you didn't know that stat devices would be mostly useless to people without lessathi blood running through their veins, then there were likely others like you, who didn't know that either."

 "I guess you make a good point."
"I don't know what to say," Leila writes. "My stat device usually lets me know when there are other people with stat devices in the area, but it didn't react to any of the people that we passed while we walked through the city. It's a big city, though, and my stat device only detects other devices if they're really close, so it's possible that we just missed them."

"I just remembered that there was something else that I wanted to ask about the stat device," I say. "Leila, you told me that you had level three in both strength and speed, but when you were fighting in the arena, you didn't seem to be much stronger or faster than that troll with the high regeneration. Is your device defective by any chance?"

"No," Leila says. "My father once told me that the physical stats from the device enhance the physical abilities that you already have, and that the more fit you are, physically, the more effect those stats will have on you. Given that I've always had a very frail constitution, this is the most I can get out of my stat device, at my current levels."

 "Huh..." I say. "Well, then, I guess that all those months I've spent doing physical training in preparation for this tournament were not wasted after all."
"You did physical training?" Kate says, shocked. "And this is the result? I bet I could beat you in an arm-wrestling match if I tried hard enough."

"I said that I only did it for a few months," I tell Kate. "And it's not like that was the only thing that I did during that time. I also needed to do my research. The research that I'm now using to figure out Eiden's weaknesses so we can finally-- hold on a second... Where is Melindra? I could swear that I saw her by the river bank just a minute ago."

"Who cares about Melindra?" Kate says.

"Well, I didn't see her set up her tent," I say. "Do you think that she's not planning to spend the night at our camp?"

"Melindra can go sleep in the river, for all I care," Kate says. "It's not like she's going to help guard the camp in any way. Which reminds me that I should be preparing to take the first shift. You guys should go get some sleep. Neither of you are scheduled to take any shifts tonight, so you might as well enjoy your rest."

We decide to take Kate's advice, and we each head towards our tents. Once I get inside, I place my notebook in my backpack and I prepare to go to bed. I still have some stuff that I'd want to read, but I can do that in the morning.

"You did physical training?" Kate says, shocked. "And this is the result? I bet I could beat you in an arm-wrestling match if I tried hard enough."

"I said that I only did it for a few months," I tell Kate. "And it's not like that was the only thing that I did during that time. I also needed to do my research. The research that I'm now using to figure out Eiden's weaknesses so we can finally-- hold on a second... Where is Melindra? I could swear that I saw her by the river bank just a minute ago."

"Who cares about Melindra?" Kate says.

"Well, I didn't see her set up her tent," I say. "Do you think that she's not planning to spend the night at our camp?"

"Melindra can go sleep in the river, for all I care," Kate says. "It's not like she's going to help guard the camp in any way. Which reminds me that I should be preparing to take the first shift. You guys should go get some sleep. Neither of you are scheduled to take any shifts tonight, so you might as well enjoy your rest."

We decide to take Kate's advice, and we each head towards our tents. Once I get inside, I place my notebook in my backpack and I prepare to go to bed. I still have some stuff that I'd want to read, but I can do that in the morning.

"I don't think that the lessathi were carrying stat boosters with them," Leila writes. "There was this one lessathi who came to threaten me while we were in our cells, and even if I didn't see his face, because he was hiding behind the wall, I could tell that he didn't have a stat device, because my own device would have alerted me if he did."

"A lessathi threatened you?" Kate asks.

"Yes," Leila writes. "He was trying to convince me to hand over my stat booster to him, but I refused to do it. He later ordered the arena owner to confiscate it from me, but the owner decided to not listen to him, because he wanted me to keep my stat device, in order to make the fight more interesting."

"I just remembered that there was something else that I wanted to ask about the stat device," I say. "Leila, you told me that you had level three in both strength and speed, but when you were fighting in the arena, you didn't seem to be much stronger or faster than that troll with the high regeneration. Is your device defective by any chance?"

"No," Leila says. "My father once told me that the physical stats from the device enhance the physical abilities that you already have, and that the more fit you are, physically, the more effect those stats will have on you.

 It only takes me about a minute to fall asleep after I put my head on the pillow. I am, however, woken up barely an hour later, by the feeling of a pair of breasts slowly pressing themselves against my chest.
As I quickly open my eyes to find out what's going on, I see that Melindra is currently trying to squeeze herself inside my tent, right next to me, but due to the relatively small area available inside, she's having a bit of trouble fitting in.

"What the--" I start to say, but I get interrupted by Melindra quickly shushing me, and putting her index finger on my mouth.

"Shhhh!" Melindra whispers. "You're going to wake up the others! Hold on, let me cast a silencing spell on the area around us."

She then quickly whispers an incantation, and the sound of the crickets that I've been hearing until now suddenly stops, along with every other sound that is coming from outside the tent.

"There!" Melindra says, in a louder voice, with a triumphant look on her face. "Now we can talk normally. Nobody outside the tent should be able to hear us."

"What are you doing here?" I ask her, as I slide myself to the opposite end of the tent, in the little space that is available to me. "How did you even get here? Isn't Kate the one keeping watch right now?"

"Oh, getting inside unnoticed was easy," Melindra says. "I just had to cast an invisibility spell, and then I opened and closed the tent at a moment when the ice mage wasn't looking."

 "An invisibility spell?" I say. "You mean the one that also masks your aura?"
"Yeah, that's the one!" Melindra says. "Eiden is the one who taught it to me."

"Okay," I say. "So I've learned how you are here, but you still haven't told me why you are here. What do you want? And why couldn't this wait until morning?"

"Well, you see," Melindra says, "when I checked the inside of my backpack this evening, I found out, to my dismay, that I'd forgotten to pack a tent before I left Thilias."

"You've got to be kidding me," I say. "And you couldn't just ask Daren or Hadrik to loan you a tent?"

"I don't know if you've noticed," Melindra says, "but I haven't really been getting along very well with most of the members of your group since we left the city."

"And your solution was to come and wake me up in the middle of the night?" I say.

 "I wasn't trying to wake you up!" Melindra says, frustrated. "Your tent is just so damn small! I only wanted to sleep inside your tent for a few hours, and to get out before you woke up. Hell, I even tried to sleep outside for a while, but there were just so many bugs trying to crawl on me, and the only protection spells I have that work while I sleep aren't made to guard me against insects!"
"But why my tent?" I say. "Why not Flower's? Or Kate's?"

"Because I couldn't stand sleeping next to Arraka for more than two seconds," Melindra says. "And your girlfriend hates my guts."

"Kate is not my girlfriend," I say, simply.

"She may as well be, judging by that ice cold look she gave me when I grabbed you by the arm," Melindra says.

"Is that what you're basing your assumption on?" I say. "Kate gives ice cold looks to everyone. Except maybe Leila."

 "If you're under the impression that the ice mage doesn't have any feelings for you, whatsoever, then you are clearly in denial."
"Listen," I say. "Kate has lived most of her adult life in the wilderness, fighting for her life. The only contact she's had with humans for the past ten years was either banshee hunters trying to kill her, or regular people running away from her, scared for their lives. She probably doesn't even know what feelings are, anymore. Kate didn't come here to have fun, and neither did I. She came here to look for her friend, and I came here to fight in a deadly tournament, in the hopes of achieving an impossible dream. Whatever it is you are seeing, it's not there."

"Well, whatever helps you sleep at night!" Melindra says. "And speaking of sleeping, I think I'm ready to hit the sack. If you need anything else from me, just whistle. Nighty-night!"

"Are you serious?" I tell Melindra, as I see her laying her head on the tent's floor, and closing her eyes.  "You can't sleep here!"

 "Why not?" Melindra asks.
"Because it's my tent!" I say.

"And?..." Melindra says, while raising an eyebrow. "The tent is clearly big enough for both of us. It will be a little bit uncomfortable, but we'll manage. Surely you don't hate me so much that you can't even stand to be near me?"

"It's not that!" I say. "It's just that I don't want us to be sleeping in the same tent together. That would only make things weird."

"Ooh!" Melindra says. "Now I get it! Well, that's fair enough, I guess. We are sharing a tent after all."

"Yes, exactly," I say. "So, hurry up and-- wait, what are you doing?!"

While I was talking, Melindra was just about to take off her blouse.

 "What do you mean, what am I doing?" Melindra asks, confused, as she stops removing her blouse half-way. "I was taking my clothes off. Isn't that what you were suggesting? That it would be weird if we were sleeping together without actually 'sleeping' together?"
"No!" I say. "I mean, yes, but I meant it in the sense that you should get out of the tent!"

"Oh?" Melindra says, while raising an eyebrow again. "So you are telling me that you DON'T want to have sex with me, then?"

"You're not seriously going to kick me out of your tent, are you?" Melindra says, this time adopting a more serious tone. "I'm only asking for a few hours of uninterrupted sleep. I'm not going to bother you. I'll wake up long before anyone gets out of their tent, and I will do my best to get out undetected. It will be as if I was never here."

 "Actually, I think I have another idea," I say.
I then struggle to crawl over her on all fours, in order to reach the entrance of the tent.

"Hey, what are you doing?" Melindra says, as I accidentally hit her chin with one of my elbows. "Cut it out!"

"I'm going to let you sleep in here for a few hours, while I'll be joining Kate on her night shift," I say.

"Wait... what?" Melindra says. "No, hold on! There's no need for you to leave your own--"

"After the first shift is done," I interrupt her, "I'll see if I can convince Hadrik or Daren to lend you a tent, since I'm pretty sure that they're the ones who will be taking the next shift. I'll come wake you up when your new tent is ready."

I then open the tent's zipper, and I begin to crawl outside.

"Wait, listen to me!" Melindra says. "You don't have to--"

"Good night, Melindra," I tell her, once I'm outside the tent, and then I close the zipper.

 "I didn't say that!"
"Well, what DID you say, then?" Melindra says.

"I was just-- ugh... are you even being serious, right now? Because with you, it's very hard to tell."

"Of course I'm being serious!" Melindra says. "Why wouldn't I be? It's not like I'm some maiden who was born yesterday. I know I may look nineteen years old, but I've been living for six hundred years. I've been with other men before. And it's not like I have any reason to not want to sleep with you, specifically. I don't particularly dislike you, we're both half-lessathi, and you are halfway decent looking. Well, slightly leaning towards the lower half, but still sort of half. You get what I mean."

"I can't tell if you are trying to compliment me, or if you're just insulting me right now..." I say.

"Look," Melindra says, "the bottom line is that there is nothing stopping us from having some fun for a few hours, and then calling it a day. There isn't even a need for me to drink the tea of infertility, because stillwaters are sterile and can't have children. And the silencing spell will still last for a good few hours, so it's not like anyone will be able to hear us. It's the perfect situation! Except for the small tent, that is... But nothing is perfect."

 "You know what?" I say. "You're right. I don't know what I was stressing about. Let's give it a shot!"
"That's more like it!" Melindra says. "Oh, but I hope you won't mind if I cast an energizing spell on you before we begin. It's just that I've had men run out of steam after only a few minutes before, and I wouldn't want to repeat the experience."

"Well, as long as the spell doesn't have any unwanted side effects..." I say.

"Oh, there's no need to worry about that!" Melindra says. "There are no side effects. That I know of. And besides, I will also be casting it on myself, so it's not like you will be the only one affected by it. Anyway, get ready, I'm casting the spell!"

As soon as Melindra is done casting the spell, I immediately start to feel the energy flowing all throughout my body. I feel as if I could run up and down a mountain, and then still have enough energy left to do a thousand push-ups. This spell is amazing! But it's very likely putting quite a strain on my body, so it probably wouldn't be wise to use it for too long. Well, a few hours won't kill me. Let's see how well this works.

 For the next several hours, Melindra and I both take full advantage of the energizing spell, and the more time passes, the more it seems like we could go on like this forever. I'm getting no signs of being tired, and even though we've had to switch positions half a dozen times due to the uncomfortable space we are in, neither of us seemed to want to end the night early.
When we are finally done for the night, the two of us get dressed, and I prepare to go to sleep for however many hours there are still left until morning.

"And here you were, saying that you didn't come to this tournament to have fun," Melindra says, with a smirk, as she ties her hair into a high ponytail.

"Okay, fine, I'll admit it," I say. "Maybe a little fun isn't so bad every once in a while."

"That's the spirit!" Melindra says, with a smile.

"Anyway, I think it's about time to go to bed," I say. "We've still got a few hours until morning, so we should try to make the most of them."

 "What are you talking about?" Melindra says, looking at me confused. "You're joking, right?... It's already morning. In fact, it's been morning for quite a while, now."
"What?" I ask her, in disbelief. "No, don't be silly! The sun isn't even up. I know that this tent is not very transparent, but we should still be able to see the rays of light when the sun rises, at least!"

"Well, then I guess that it must be really cloudy outside," Melindra says. "You don't need to take my word for it. Your stat device shows you the hour of the day, right? You can check it yourself. I'm telling you, it's been morning for at least two hours, if not more."

I suddenly panic, and I take my stat device out, to see what hour it is. Just as Melindra said, it seems that it's already well past sunrise. As I stare at my screen, I can see the hour clearly in front of my face, but it feels like my mind is still refusing to process the information.

"How did this happen?" I ask Melindra. "How is it morning already? I don't understand. It's only been a few hours!"

"Time flies when you're having fun," Melindra says. "Is this really the first time you've experienced an energizing spell? Don't worry, you'll get used to it, eventually. I had trouble like this too, the first time I cast the spell on myself, but now I don't have these sorts of problems anymore."

 "Why are you so calm about this?" I ask her. "I at least got an hour of sleep before you woke me up, but you didn't sleep at all! How are we going to handle ourselves after your energizing spell runs out?"
"We'll be fine!" Melindra says. "When we'll start to get tired, I'll just cast the energizing spell again, and it should hold us for the rest of the day."

"But aren't there supposed to be drawbacks if you cast these kinds of spells one after the other without a break?" I say.

"Eh..." Melindra says. "There might be some small risk of heart failure, but I'm sure we'll manage. We're both young. Well, you're sort of young, and I'm always young, but my point still stands. We shouldn't have anything to worry about."

"Okay, whatever," I say. "We'll see about that later. But for now, can you turn yourself invisible, so the others won't see you leaving the tent?"

 "Oh..." Melindra says. "Well, you see... while I may have learned that spell from Eiden, the thing is that I didn't really learn a complete version of it. The spell itself works just fine, but I can only cast it once a day, and I've already cast it once in the past twenty-four hours."
"Okay," I say. "Okay... No problem. We can fix this. I can't hear anyone outside, so I don't think they've woken up, yet. Flower had the last shift, if I remember correctly, so with a little luck, she might not see you when you walk out of here. Hold on, let me open the tent, and we'll see if the coast is clear."

"Wait!" Melindra shouts, when she sees me pull on the tent's zipper. "The silencing spell hasn't been canceled, yet!"

As I finish opening the tent, I immediately regret my decision, because every single one of my teammates are currently standing several dozen feet away from me, and they're all now staring straight at me and Melindra.

"Oh... right..." I say.

"Good," I say. "Let's go to sleep, then. It's going to be a long day, tomorrow."

We both fall asleep in a matter of minutes, and although it wasn't exactly the most comfortable night I've ever had, it wasn't all that bad either. When I wake up in the morning, however, I suddenly realize how much of a fool I was to believe anything that came out of Melindra's mouth.

"Hey, Melindra!" I say, as I shake the stillwater girl, in an attempt to wake her up. "Melindra! Wake up, damn you! You said that you'd be out of here before dawn. Do you see this?"

I then put my stat device in front of her face, so she can clearly see what hour of the day it is.

"It's already morning!" I tell her. "Wake up! Wake up, and cast that invisibility spell of yours, so you can walk out of the tent undetected, like you promised."

"I can't cast it..." Melindra says, with a sleepy voice, and with her eyes half closed. "Only once a day... Already cast once..."

 "Great!" I say. "Just great! Well, it's not that late, and I'm not hearing anyone outside, so with a little luck, we might still be able to pull this off. I think Flower had the last shift, so if you can just avoid her, you'll be in the clear. I'll open this tent to see if the coast is clear, and if I give you the signal, you'll rush straight out, do you understand?"
"Mmm..." Melindra says, as she raises her head from the ground, with her eyes still half-closed. "Mmhmm..."

She then pulls on the tent's zipper, and she prepares to exit the tent.

Melindra ignores me completely, and she exits the tent, closing the zipper behind her.

 Huh. Well, that didn't go so well. Maybe with a little luck Kate didn't see her walk out of my tent. Actually, what am I even worrying about? Even if she did see her, I should easily be able to explain what happened. And it's not like I'm worried about Melindra's threat, or anything. She's still under the oath's effect, so there's nothing she can do to me. I mean... it's not like she can actually do anything to inconvenience me if she can't even use her powers to hurt me.
