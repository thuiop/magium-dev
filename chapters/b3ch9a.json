Am I saying the name correctly? Is it pronounced 'drones'?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's what Billy Bob used to call them,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"My king,\" Peter says, \"while I do understand the tactical advantages of engaging our enemy when it is in a weakened state, do you not think it would have been wise to wait until more of our troops were ready to join the battle?\"<br/><br/> \"Summer storms in Varathia are highly unpredictable,\" the king of the underground says. \"There really is no way to tell in advance how long they will last. An opportunity like this is too valuable to pass up, even if it means going into battle a little less prepared than we would have hoped.\"<br/>\"Is Breynan done teleporting everyone?\" Albert says, as he looks around, counting the people in the room. \"I'm still not seeing Herman or Howard. Will they be joining us after all or not?\"<br/><br/>\"Howard will not be coming with us,\" the king of the underground says. \"His wound from yesterday had reopened right after you teleported to the surface, despite all the healing he's received, so I was forced to ask him to stay behind.\"<br/><br/>\"That is... unfortunate,\" Albert says. \"I know how much he wanted to be a part of the final mission to liberate Ollendor, so I can only imagine how tough it must be for him to get cast aside like this. What about Herman?\"<br/><br/> \"Herman will be teleporting with the next batch of people, which should be here soon,\" the king of the underground says. \"I told Breynan to wait a few minutes after each teleportation, in order to avoid overheating the device. The last thing we'd want right now is to cause a malfunction in our teleporting device and leave ourselves stranded here, especially after our main technician has been imprisoned for treason.\"<br/>\"Will Breynan not be joining us, my lord?\" asks one of the mages that teleported to the surface together with us.<br/><br/>\"No,\" the king of the underground says. \"I've asked Breynan to remain underground, because if he were to come with us as well, there would be nobody left to lead our people in case anything went wrong with our mission. I know that you are a member of his usual team and are not used to going on surface expeditions without his guidance, but you are one of our most competent fighters, so we really needed to have you with us today. I trust that you will handle yourself well even without your mentor, and that you will make him proud of your achievements.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, sir,\" the mage says. \"I will!\"<br/><br/>",

I know that you've been waiting for this day for many years. The day when Ollendor finally becomes free... Well, right now the only thing that stands between us and that freedom is the Overseer. He is the sole remnant of an age of tyranny and repression that has claimed many lives of our brothers and sisters. But that ends today! Today we will claim back what is rightfully ours. Today, we take back Ollendor!\"<br/>The king of the underground lets his men cheer for a few seconds, but then he raises his hands in the air, signaling them to stop.<br/><br/>\"Does everyone know what they need to do?\" he asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, my lord,\" we hear a few of the warriors say, as the others are also nodding their heads in agreement.<br/><br/>\"Then let us proceed,\" the king says. \"Our destination is not much further from this building. We will make sure to take out as many of the drones as we can on our way there. May the gods be with us!\"<br/><br/> \"Are you alright, Jack?\" Albert says to the young mage who asked about Breynan earlier, while putting a hand on his shoulder.<br/>\"Uhm, y-- yes sir!\" Jack says.<br/><br/>\"Look,\" Albert says, \"I know I'm not Breynan, but if you need help out there on the battlefield you can count on me, okay?\"<br/><br/>\"O-- of course!\" Jack says. \"I promise I won't let you down, sir!\"<br/><br/>\"Good luck!\" Albert says, and then he walks past him to join the king of the underground.<br/><br/>Instead of following him, Jack takes out a pendant from his pocket, he looks at it for a few seconds and then he clutches it firmly with both his hands while closing his eyes.<br/><br/>",

One would have thought that the Overseer would at least try to ready some of his forces for the upcoming conflict, even if he's not planning to make the first move. However, the drones seem to be ignoring us completely, and I can't help but wonder what is causing such an unusual behavio--\"<br/>\"Your highness, are you there?\" we hear a man's voice, coming through a transceiver that the king of the underground was keeping strapped to his belt.<br/><br/>\"I can hear you,\" the king says, after he taps the transceiver once. \"Tell me, what is it?\"<br/><br/>\"It was just as you predicted, my king!\" the man says. \"The flying metal balls started slowly advancing towards your position shortly after the outsiders exited the abandoned storage building! They must have been scheming together with the Overseer this whole time. There's no doubt about it!\"<br/><br/> As we begin to hear an uneasy murmur coming from the men gathered around us, the king of the underground lightly slaps his own forehead with his right palm.<br/>\"And what did I tell you to do if something like this were to occur, Gregory?\" the king says, to the man from the transceiver.<br/><br/>\"Uh... you told me... to wait until you call me, because you wanted to first hear what the outsiders had to say in their defense,\" Gregory says. \"I'm sorry, my lord. I... got ahead of myself. But this proves their guilt, surely! There should be no need to listen to what they have to say any longer.\"<br/><br/>\"That is for me to decide, Gregory, not you,\" the king of the underground says. \"This will be all for now. Please return to your post. I will be closing this channel.\"<br/><br/>He then taps the transceiver in order to interrupt his conversation with Gregory, like he said.<br/><br/>\"Well?...\" the king asks us, after he sees us just standing there in silence for a few seconds. \"Is there anything you want to say to us?\"<br/><br/>",

Please stand by!\"<br/>\"Experimental emergency protocol?...\" Hadrik says. \"What in the blazes is that supposed to--\"<br/><br/>A deafening silence fills the area around me as the sound of Hadrik's voice, as well as the wind from the storm and all the shouting from the rebels fighting the drones fade away completely. As I look around myself to understand what happened, I see that the whole world surrounding me has simply... disappeared.<br/><br/> I am currently floating in what appears to be a sea of pure light, with none of my friends being anywhere near me. In fact, upon closer inspection of my surroundings, I realize that it is not only my friends and the world who are gone, but also my own person. When I look down I see no body: no arms, no legs, no torso... what about my head? The brightness of this place is almost blinding me, so logically speaking I must still have my eyes, right? But does that mean I'm just a floating head drifting about in this vast plane filled with nothing but light?<br/>And what about my breathing?... I can't hear myself inhaling or exhaling. Have I just been holding my breath this entire time? Should I start breathing so I don't die of asphyxiation? My mind feels like a jumbled mess right now. I have no idea what to do.<br/><br/>",

If I'm still alive, then it means that I don't need to breathe. In fact, is there even any air in here? What is this place, exactly? Somehow, it looks very familiar...<br/>As my mind is slowly clearing up from the haze that it's been in this whole time, I suddenly remember the sensation that I had back when the Magium was possessing the Overseer and flinging my consciousness through all the separate planes of existence, including the ethereal plane.<br/><br/>Now I get it... This is the ethereal plane. That's why it seemed so familiar! It's because I've been here before. How in the world did I end up in this place, anyway? And where is everybody else? Did the Overseer's drones somehow throw them out in this wasteland too? Did they do it by using the blue crystals? I need to get away from here and find my friends. If only I could move somehow. If only I at least had some... hands!<br/><br/>Right as I am thinking that last word, two hands materialize in front of me, out of nowhere. I try to move the two hands and I realize that I have complete control over them, as if they were my own, even if the rest of my body is still missing.<br/><br/>What just happened? Is that how things work around here? Is it enough for me to make a wish and it comes true? If that's how it goes, then I want legs too. Give me legs!<br/><br/> I wait around for a little while, but nothing's happening. Did I make the wish wrong? Let me try again. I wish to have legs! And the rest of my body too, actually. Give me my body back!<br/>Again, nothing. This isn't working. Maybe I should just give up for now and try to make do with what I have. I only have my hands, not my entire arms, but I should still be able to get some use out of them, right?<br/><br/>As I instinctively do a swimming motion with my hands, I can feel myself advancing through the light, although there aren't really any points of reference around here, so there's no easy way for me to confirm my travelling speed. I keep swimming through the bright empty space for a few more minutes, until I hear a girl's voice calling out to me from a distance.<br/><br/>\"Barry, is that you?\" I hear Flower's voice faintly, as she is approaching me. \"Wait there, don't move! I'm coming for you!\"<br/><br/>When Flower gets closer to me, I see that her eyes are bright red, just like that time when she fought Eiden before we got into Thilias, and the aura around her body feels as if it were radiating heat.<br/><br/> \"Wow, Barry, you managed to conjure some hands for yourself,\" Flower says, once she reaches me. \"That's so cool!\"<br/>\"Forget my hands!\" I say. \"What happened to your eyes? And your whole aura feels like it's burning up. Are you okay?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh you don't need to worry about that!\" Flower says. \"That's just how I am, now.\"<br/><br/>She then snaps her fingers, and her whole body suddenly becomes covered in flames, even though upon closer inspection, the fire seems to be floating about one inch above her skin rather than burning her outright.<br/><br/>\"See?\" Flower says, and then she casually turns off the flames, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.<br/><br/>\"Uhm... okay,\" I tell her. \"If you say so. Wait, how come you have your whole body and I don't? What am I doing wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know,\" Flower says. \"I've been living here since I was born, so there was never a time when I didn't have a body in the ethereal plane. If you want to conjure a body for yourself, maybe you just need to... think harder or something? It's easy to create stuff out of nothing in this place. Look!\"<br/><br/>",

The palm tree then turns into a cart, and the cart soon turns into a large rock. As soon as she's done with her demonstration, Flower claps her hands once, and the rock disappears into thin air.<br/>\"What the-- that's amazing!\" I say. \"Can you teach me how to do that?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... I'm not sure,\" Flower says. \"Petal always told me that I'm not exactly the best at teaching things to others. And I'm not exactly sure how to make this any clearer to you than I already have. For me this is just something natural, you know? Maybe it's just an advantage of being an ethereal. Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here for too long. It's not good for you! Follow me, I'll take you to my house. Leila and Hadrik are already waiting there for you. And Petal too! Here, grab my hand!\"<br/><br/>She then takes my hand without waiting for my answer, and her body gets covered in flames again, which surprisingly don't feel like they're burning me even though they should. I then feel myself vibrating loudly, as a white light of a different color than the one I've been swimming through covers us both and we get teleported to an entirely different place.<br/><br/>\"Barry, you're alive!\" I hear Leila's inner voice, which I already know from the last time she and I were sent to the ethereal plane together. \"Thank goodness!\"<br/><br/> I look around myself and I see that we are now inside a room full of toys and countless decorations like mural paintings of knights and dragons, as well as a table on which there is an expensive looking vase with a few tulips in it. Leila and Hadrik are both standing in front of me, but I'm not seeing Illuna yet. Maybe she is in another room?<br/>\"See, Leila?\" Flower says. \"I told you that there would be nothing to worry about! Barry is fine, and he didn't do anything stupid, like trying to breathe without his lungs!\"<br/><br/>\"...What's that about me trying to breathe?\" I say, somewhat anxiously.<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Flower says, \"when I brought Leila here, I told her that most people who get thrown out of their own minds and into the light outside should be in a state of daze, mostly just floating around indefinitely until someone finds them, and that the only way they could die would be if they tried to breathe, because then they'd suddenly find themselves with a need to breathe fresh air into their lungs, but without having any actual lungs... or air. When she heard about this, Leila immediately panicked, and she told me that you're exactly the type of person who overthinks things in these sorts of situations to the point that you may well end up dying of suffocation. But you never tried to do any of that, did you, Barry?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, actually...\" I say. \"I may have been only a few moments away from trying to breathe at one point. The only thing that saved me was the fact that I realized there was no way I could need air to survive in this place if I'd already survived without breathing for so long.\"<br/><br/> \"I knew it!\" I hear Leila's thoughts, as her mouth remains closed. \"Even when we were almost being erased from existence he was doing the same thing! He almost didn't grab my hand because he was worried that I might have been an illusion, trying to trick him.\"<br/>Hadrik laughs.<br/><br/>\"Well, that's Barry for you,\" he says. \"He always finds a way to turn even the most trivial of situations into a life-threatening adventure! But I have to say, it's still hard to accustom myself to hearing Leila's voice instead of seeing her write text in front of me. Barry, you already heard her voice before, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I heard it the last time when we went to the ethereal plane and-- hold on a minute, why am I the only one here with a pair of floating hands? How did you guys get your bodies back so fast?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm the one who taught them how to do it,\" I hear an unfamiliar female voice coming from my left side.<br/><br/>When I turn around, I see a woman that looks as if she were in her late twenties, with blue eyes, blue hair and pointy ears, wearing a blue dress, and who is of about my height. Even though her appearance is a lot different from what I'm used to, the serious look in her eyes and her constant frown is almost unmistakable.<br/><br/>",

In less than a few seconds, my whole body appears out of nowhere, as if it's only been invisible this whole time, and I am wearing the exact same clothes that I had on the earthen plane.<br/><br/>\"That's amazing!\" I say. \"What did the incantation mean? I didn't recognize the language.\"<br/><br/>\"It meant nothing,\" Illuna says, simply.<br/><br/>\"Pardon?\" I ask her, confused.<br/><br/>\"It was gibberish,\" Illuna says. \"Just something that I invented on the spot to make the ritual sound more believable.\"<br/><br/>\"And the thing about looking at the feather?\" I say. \"Was that something you made up too?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch9_illuna || 0) == 2) {%> \"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"In this place, you can do anything with your mind, as long as your thoughts are powerful enough. For something as simple as gaining back your body, all you need is to be convinced that you can do it, and you will be successful. That is why I gave you these simple tasks to accomplish. You already knew that I had helped Leila and Hadrik recover their bodies, so you were convinced that as long as you'd follow my instructions to the letter, the same would apply to you. If I were to have instead told you something vague like how you'd need to 'erase any doubts in your head and be completely confident in your own abilities', you probably would have tried to think about it logically, and you would have begun to doubt yourself, because there would be no way for you to accurately measure your level of confidence.\"<br/>\"You said that it's easier to obtain my body than it is to do other stuff,\" I say. \"What about making things appear out of nothing? I saw Flower do it outside. She just made a palm tree and a cart show up, out of nowhere.\"<br/><br/>\"Flower has been living here a long time, so naturally she is more accustomed to the ways of this place,\" Illuna says. \"Aside from her advantage of being an ethereal, I think there's also the fact that on the ethereal plane you benefit from having stronger emotions rather than from analyzing every little detail, and Flower typically has strong emotions about anything. This is the only place in the world where her illogical way of thinking actually gives her the upper hand, instead of being one of her weak points.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

When I realized what happened, I got this sudden, urgent feeling that I had to do something or everyone would die, and then, uh... and then...\"<br/><br/>She pauses for a while to think, looking as if she were having a hard time trying to describe what happened to her.<br/><br/>\"And then her eyes became bright red and the whole aura around her body was set aflame,\" Illuna says. \"Next thing you know, she could easily locate your whereabouts from anywhere on the ethereal plane, and she could traverse long distances almost instantaneously. I'm still not entirely certain how that happened, but based on the little amount of information I have at my disposal, I'm going to assume that it was something akin to a next stage of evolution that is specific to ethereals, or something along those lines.\"<br/><br/>",

Isn't this her house?\"<br/><br/> \"No, this is not a real house,\" Illuna says, looking slightly irritated. \"We've already talked about this. She made it look like a house, but in reality, this is the inside of her mind. She has complete control over this place and she can turn it into anything she wants.\"<br/>\"But how does--\" Hadrik starts to say, but then he interrupts himself. \"Ugh... Never mind. Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, here. Ever since I came to Flower's house, I've been trying really hard to not think of anything so that you guys wouldn't hear my thoughts, but the problem is that when I'm so focused on not thinking out loud by accident, I can barely follow anything of what you're saying! How are you guys making conversation so casually without jumbling your spoken words with your inner thoughts? I don't get it!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, uh...\" I say, as Leila and I exchange a look. \"Illuna's been here for a long time, so it must come naturally to her by now. As for me and Leila, I think it's because we've already been to the ethereal plane once before, and we kind of got the general idea of how this 'thinking out loud' stuff works.\"<br/><br/>\"Ah, so you two are already experts in the field, then!\" Hadrik says. \"As an expert, you wouldn't happen to have some advice for a beginner like myself, would you, Barry?\"<br/><br/>",

I don't think they actually exist in the real world.\"<br/>\"The cookies are based on a recipe that you were using on the earthen plane, correct?\" Melindra says, after she takes one bite. \"I remember you creating some very similar cookies using the food creation spell of the golden fox.\"<br/><br/>\"They are similar, but not exactly the same,\" Flower says. \"The food creation spell is amazing, but it's still very limiting compared to what I can do here in my mind.

When we're done with the ones that I know, however, things start becoming a little more difficult.<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" Melindra says, after she sees me fail a spell that she just explained to me. \"Give me a second. I'm trying to figure out how to explain this in a way that makes sense for someone who is used to learning magic from books and not through trial and error.\"<br/>\"I mean, I'm fine with trial and error too, as long as it doesn't take too long,\" I say. \"How do you usually learn new spells?\"<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Melindra says, \"I'm not sure how magic works on this plane of existence, since I can't seem to get it to work myself, but what I normally do is that I try to, uh... resonate with the correct frequency of the magical energy that builds up inside me while casting the spell. Does that make sense to you?\"<br/><br/>\"I think it does, yeah...\" I say. \"That's how you cast spells as an elementalist, right? I remember doing something similar when I had my magic stats unlocked during my fights with Tyrath and the stillwater skeletons. The problem is that I don't really feel any energy inside me while I'm casting spells in this realm, so I can't make use of this information. Isn't there anything you could tell me about the direction of the flow? For example... what direction do you instinctively look at when you start casting the spell? What about afterwards? I'm pretty sure that the way you move your eyes as an elementalist should be the most indicative of the direction that the flow of magic is supposed to take.\"<br/><br/> \"Let me try it now,\" Melindra says, as she gets into a stance, closes her eyes and then tries to visualize the non-existent magical energy from this plane of existence. \"It starts with the upper left, then it goes all the way down, then it slowly goes back up heading towards the right until--\"<br/>\"Perfect!\" I say. \"That's all I needed to know.\"<br/><br/>\"Really?\" Melindra asks. \"That's it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I've studied many thousands of spells, so I can usually detect a pattern pretty quickly if I've seen it a few times before. As luck would have it, this is one of the more common patterns when it comes to magic flows, so I'm pretty confident that I know where it goes from here. I'll give it a try, and you can correct my movements if I'm too far off-course. Here we go!\"<br/><br/>After I manage to cast the spell that Melindra was trying to teach me, we use the same learning method for the next few spells, and it works flawlessly. As I am focusing on learning as many spells as possible in the limited time we have at our disposal, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing.<br/><br/>",

Either way, on the off-chance that you do manage to figure it out, Flower and I are telepathically linked due to our soul fusion, so I can contact her no matter where she is on the ethereal plane and she will come back to teleport you to the battlefield.\"<br/><br/>\"You two are telepathically linked?\" Leila asks, surprised. \"Does this mean that you are hearing each other's thoughts all the time?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not hearing her thoughts any more than I'm hearing yours while we are in the same room,\" Illuna says. \"As long as we are both careful to not use words when we're thinking, we can keep our thoughts to ourselves.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch8_overseer2 || 0) == 1) {%> While I am still busy practicing, Flower suddenly turns around and she looks intently at one of the room's walls, as if she were trying to see through them. This catches the attention of Illuna, who now asks her a question.<br/>\"What's wrong?\" Illuna says. \"Did something happen in the ether?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah...\" Flower answers Illuna. \"It looks like Peter and the Overseer are both on the move. They haven't run into each other yet, but they probably will soon. Also, Peter seems to have already found the king of the underground's soul, and they're currently travelling together.\"<br/><br/>As Illuna and Flower are talking, we can hear some grunts in the background from Daren, who is putting a lot of effort in trying to replicate my spell casting technique, although he's had no success with it so far. My other friends tried it too at first, but they eventually gave up and just decided to enjoy the food and beverage served to them by Flower. At the present time, Flower, Illuna and I are the only ones who seem to be able to cast any sort of spells in this place.<br/><br/>\"In that case, I don't think we can afford to wait any longer,\" Illuna says. \"If you want to join the battle on the ethereal plane, you should probably do it before it begins.\"<br/><br/>\"Won't you be coming with us?\" Flower asks.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch8_overseer2 || 0) == 1) {%> \"Oh, right,\" Leila says. \"I suppose that makes sense.\"<br/>\"So... are you ready, Barry?\" Flower says, as I am now casting my air currents on myself, so that I'll be able to fly through the ether at a moment's notice. \"Where do you think we should teleport first? We could go and fight Peter directly, or we could try to meet up with the Overseer first and team up with him. I don't know how well the Overseer can handle himself in the ethereal plane, so he might get in our way more than helping us, but I still think it might be worth a shot to go talk to him.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",
