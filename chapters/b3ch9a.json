Am I saying the name correctly? Is it pronounced 'drones'?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's what Billy Bob used to call them,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"My king,\" Peter says, \"while I do understand the tactical advantages of engaging our enemy when it is in a weakened state, do you not think it would have been wise to wait until more of our troops were ready to join the battle?\"<br/><br/> \"Summer storms in Varathia are highly unpredictable,\" the king of the underground says. \"There really is no way to tell in advance how long they will last. An opportunity like this is too valuable to pass up, even if it means going into battle a little less prepared than we would have hoped.\"<br/>\"Is Breynan done teleporting everyone?\" Albert says, as he looks around, counting the people in the room. \"I'm still not seeing Herman or Howard. Will they be joining us after all or not?\"<br/><br/>\"Howard will not be coming with us,\" the king of the underground says. \"His wound from yesterday had reopened right after you teleported to the surface, despite all the healing he's received, so I was forced to ask him to stay behind.\"<br/><br/>\"That is... unfortunate,\" Albert says. \"I know how much he wanted to be a part of the final mission to liberate Ollendor, so I can only imagine how tough it must be for him to get cast aside like this. What about Herman?\"<br/><br/> \"Herman will be teleporting with the next batch of people, which should be here soon,\" the king of the underground says. \"I told Breynan to wait a few minutes after each teleportation, in order to avoid overheating the device. The last thing we'd want right now is to cause a malfunction in our teleporting device and leave ourselves stranded here, especially after our main technician has been imprisoned for treason.\"<br/>\"Will Breynan not be joining us, my lord?\" asks one of the mages that teleported to the surface together with us.<br/><br/>\"No,\" the king of the underground says. \"I've asked Breynan to remain underground, because if he were to come with us as well, there would be nobody left to lead our people in case anything went wrong with our mission. I know that you are a member of his usual team and are not used to going on surface expeditions without his guidance, but you are one of our most competent fighters, so we really needed to have you with us today. I trust that you will handle yourself well even without your mentor, and that you will make him proud of your achievements.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, sir,\" the mage says. \"I will!\"<br/><br/>",

I know that you've been waiting for this day for many years. The day when Ollendor finally becomes free... Well, right now the only thing that stands between us and that freedom is the Overseer. He is the sole remnant of an age of tyranny and repression that has claimed many lives of our brothers and sisters. But that ends today! Today we will claim back what is rightfully ours. Today, we take back Ollendor!\"<br/>The king of the underground lets his men cheer for a few seconds, but then he raises his hands in the air, signaling them to stop.<br/><br/>\"Does everyone know what they need to do?\" he asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, my lord,\" we hear a few of the warriors say, as the others are also nodding their heads in agreement.<br/><br/>\"Then let us proceed,\" the king says. \"Our destination is not much further from this building. We will make sure to take out as many of the drones as we can on our way there. May the gods be with us!\"<br/><br/> \"Are you alright, Jack?\" Albert says to the young mage who asked about Breynan earlier, while putting a hand on his shoulder.<br/>\"Uhm, y-- yes sir!\" Jack says.<br/><br/>\"Look,\" Albert says, \"I know I'm not Breynan, but if you need help out there on the battlefield you can count on me, okay?\"<br/><br/>\"O-- of course!\" Jack says. \"I promise I won't let you down, sir!\"<br/><br/>\"Good luck!\" Albert says, and then he walks past him to join the king of the underground.<br/><br/>Instead of following him, Jack takes out a pendant from his pocket, he looks at it for a few seconds and then he clutches it firmly with both his hands while closing his eyes.<br/><br/>",

One would have thought that the Overseer would at least try to ready some of his forces for the upcoming conflict, even if he's not planning to make the first move. However, the drones seem to be ignoring us completely, and I can't help but wonder what is causing such an unusual behavio--\"<br/>\"Your highness, are you there?\" we hear a man's voice, coming through a transceiver that the king of the underground was keeping strapped to his belt.<br/><br/>\"I can hear you,\" the king says, after he taps the transceiver once. \"Tell me, what is it?\"<br/><br/>\"It was just as you predicted, my king!\" the man says. \"The flying metal balls started slowly advancing towards your position shortly after the outsiders exited the abandoned storage building! They must have been scheming together with the Overseer this whole time. There's no doubt about it!\"<br/><br/> As we begin to hear an uneasy murmur coming from the men gathered around us, the king of the underground lightly slaps his own forehead with his right palm.<br/>\"And what did I tell you to do if something like this were to occur, Gregory?\" the king says, to the man from the transceiver.<br/><br/>\"Uh... you told me... to wait until you call me, because you wanted to first hear what the outsiders had to say in their defense,\" Gregory says. \"I'm sorry, my lord. I... got ahead of myself. But this proves their guilt, surely! There should be no need to listen to what they have to say any longer.\"<br/><br/>\"That is for me to decide, Gregory, not you,\" the king of the underground says. \"This will be all for now. Please return to your post. I will be closing this channel.\"<br/><br/>He then taps the transceiver in order to interrupt his conversation with Gregory, like he said.<br/><br/>\"Well?...\" the king asks us, after he sees us just standing there in silence for a few seconds. \"Is there anything you want to say to us?\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " I just need to calm down and think things through. I don't have a body right now, so there are no lungs for the air to go into. If I'm still alive, then it means that I don't need to breathe. In fact, is there even any air in here? What is this place, exactly? Somehow, it looks very familiar...<br/>As my mind is slowly clearing up from the haze that it's been in this whole time, I suddenly remember the sensation that I had back when the Magium was possessing the Overseer and flinging my consciousness through all the separate planes of existence, including the ethereal plane.<br/><br/>Now I get it... This is the ethereal plane. That's why it seemed so familiar! It's because I've been here before. How in the world did I end up in this place, anyway? And where is everybody else? Did the Overseer's drones somehow throw them out in this wasteland too? Did they do it by using the blue crystals? I need to get away from here and find my friends. If only I could move somehow. If only I at least had some... hands!<br/><br/>Right as I am thinking that last word, two hands materialize in front of me, out of nowhere. I try to move the two hands and I realize that I have complete control over them, as if they were my own, even if the rest of my body is still missing.<br/><br/>What just happened? Is that how things work around here? Is it enough for me to make a wish and it comes true? If that's how it goes, then I want legs too. Give me legs!<br/><br/> I wait around for a little while, but nothing's happening. Did I make the wish wrong? Let me try again. I wish to have legs! And the rest of my body too, actually. Give me my body back!<br/>Again, nothing. This isn't working. Maybe I should just give up for now and try to make do with what I have. I only have my hands, not my entire arms, but I should still be able to get some use out of them, right?<br/><br/>As I instinctively do a swimming motion with my hands, I can feel myself advancing through the light, although there aren't really any points of reference around here, so there's no easy way for me to confirm my travelling speed. I keep swimming through the bright empty space for a few more minutes, until I hear a girl's voice calling out to me from a distance.<br/><br/>\"Barry, is that you?\" I hear Flower's voice faintly, as she is approaching me. \"Wait there, don't move! I'm coming for you!\"<br/><br/>When Flower gets closer to me, I see that her eyes are bright red, just like that time when she fought Eiden before we got into Thilias, and the aura around her body feels as if it were radiating heat.<br/><br/> \"Wow, Barry, you managed to conjure some hands for yourself,\" Flower says, once she reaches me. \"That's so cool!\"<br/>\"Forget my hands!\" I say. \"What happened to your eyes? And your whole aura feels like it's burning up. Are you okay?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh you don't need to worry about that!\" Flower says. \"That's just how I am, now.\"<br/><br/>She then snaps her fingers, and her whole body suddenly becomes covered in flames, even though upon closer inspection, the fire seems to be floating about one inch above her skin rather than burning her outright.<br/><br/>\"See?\" Flower says, and then she casually turns off the flames, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.<br/><br/>\"Uhm... okay,\" I tell her. \"If you say so. Wait, how come you have your whole body and I don't? What am I doing wrong?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know,\" Flower says. \"I've been living here since I was born, so there was never a time when I didn't have a body in the ethereal plane. If you want to conjure a body for yourself, maybe you just need to... think harder or something? It's easy to create stuff out of nothing in this place. Look!\"<br/><br/>",

The palm tree then turns into a cart, and the cart soon turns into a large rock. As soon as she's done with her demonstration, Flower claps her hands once, and the rock disappears into thin air.<br/>\"What the-- that's amazing!\" I say. \"Can you teach me how to do that?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... I'm not sure,\" Flower says. \"Petal always told me that I'm not exactly the best at teaching things to others. And I'm not exactly sure how to make this any clearer to you than I already have. For me this is just something natural, you know? Maybe it's just an advantage of being an ethereal. Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here for too long. It's not good for you! Follow me, I'll take you to my house. Leila and Hadrik are already waiting there for you. And Petal too! Here, grab my hand!\"<br/><br/>She then takes my hand without waiting for my answer, and her body gets covered in flames again, which surprisingly don't feel like they're burning me even though they should. I then feel myself vibrating loudly, as a white light of a different color than the one I've been swimming through covers us both and we get teleported to an entirely different place.<br/><br/>\"Barry, you're alive!\" I hear Leila's inner voice, which I already know from the last time she and I were sent to the ethereal plane together. \"Thank goodness!\"<br/><br/> I look around myself and I see that we are now inside a room full of toys and countless decorations like mural paintings of knights and dragons, as well as a table on which there is an expensive looking vase with a few tulips in it. Leila and Hadrik are both standing in front of me, but I'm not seeing Illuna yet. Maybe she is in another room?<br/>\"See, Leila?\" Flower says. \"I told you that there would be nothing to worry about! Barry is fine, and he didn't do anything stupid, like trying to breathe without his lungs!\"<br/><br/>\"...What's that about me trying to breathe?\" I say, somewhat anxiously.<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" Flower says, \"when I brought Leila here, I told her that most people who get thrown out of their own minds and into the light outside should be in a state of daze, mostly just floating around indefinitely until someone finds them, and that the only way they could die would be if they tried to breathe, because then they'd suddenly find themselves with a need to breathe fresh air into their lungs, but without having any actual lungs... or air. When she heard about this, Leila immediately panicked, and she told me that you're exactly the type of person who overthinks things in these sorts of situations to the point that you may well end up dying of suffocation. But you never tried to do any of that, did you, Barry?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, actually...\" I say. \"I may have been only a few moments away from trying to breathe at one point. The only thing that saved me was the fact that I realized there was no way I could need air to survive in this place if I'd already survived without breathing for so long.\"<br/><br/> \"I knew it!\" I hear Leila's thoughts, as her mouth remains closed. \"Even when we were almost being erased from existence he was doing the same thing! He almost didn't grab my hand because he was worried that I might have been an illusion, trying to trick him.\"<br/>Hadrik laughs.<br/><br/>\"Well, that's Barry for you,\" he says. \"He always finds a way to turn even the most trivial of situations into a life-threatening adventure! But I have to say, it's still hard to accustom myself to hearing Leila's voice instead of seeing her write text in front of me. Barry, you already heard her voice before, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I heard it the last time when we went to the ethereal plane and-- hold on a minute, why am I the only one here with a pair of floating hands? How did you guys get your bodies back so fast?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm the one who taught them how to do it,\" I hear an unfamiliar female voice coming from my left side.<br/><br/>When I turn around, I see a woman that looks as if she were in her late twenties, with blue eyes, blue hair and pointy ears, wearing a blue dress, and who is of about my height. Even though her appearance is a lot different from what I'm used to, the serious look in her eyes and her constant frown is almost unmistakable.<br/><br/>",

That is where all souls eventually end up once the bodies from the earthen plane that they were linked with die, and also where they begin to slowly decompose into ethereal matter.\"<br/><br/>\"Really?\" Flower asks, shocked. \"The light out there is just a bunch of dead souls?!\"<br/><br/>\"Why are you acting so surprised?\" Illuna says. \"You've been living here for more time than me, haven't you?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" Flower says, \"but I just thought the reason why there was so much light was because we were really close to the sun or something...\"<br/><br/>\"There is no sun here,\" Illuna says. \"This is the ethereal plane.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, right. Right... I knew that!\" Flower says, in a nervous tone.<br/><br/>\"So, do you guys have any idea what happened to us and where everyone else is?\" I say. \"Are Daren, Kate and Melindra still out there in the ether? What about the king of the underground and his men?\"<br/><br/> \"I'm not sure what the Overseer did, exactly,\" Illuna says, \"but I assume that he must have somehow made use of his newfound knowledge about the blue crystals and the Magium to throw the souls of everyone in the area out of their own minds.\"<br/>\"I remember Kate telling us at one point about how she read in an old lessathi book that a person's mind is supposedly located on the ethereal plane and not on the earthen plane,\" I say. \"When you say that the souls got thrown out of their minds, you're talking about their minds which are located here, in this plane of existence?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says, \"I'm talking about the fortified structures that are designed to defend each soul against the corrosive effects of the ether, and which are also meant to help connect the soul to their earthen body. This house that we are in, for example, is Flower's mind.\"<br/><br/>\"Is that so?...\" I say, as I take a better look around the room that I am in.<br/><br/>\"In any case, I believe that we are straying too far from our original topic,\" Illuna says. \"The point I was trying to make was that if the Overseer did indeed find a way to eject all of the people in the plaza out of their minds, then the majority of the people involved in the fight against the drones should be floating in the ether right now.\"<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" I say. \"But Flower said that they should all be in a daze, right? How will we find them if we can't see their bodies and if they won't be clear-headed enough to answer our calls?\"<br/>\"Ask Flower,\" Illuna says. \"She's the one who found you, Hadrik and Leila, not me.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh!\" Flower says, when she sees us all looking at her. \"Well, you see... When I realized what happened, I got this sudden, urgent feeling that I had to do something or everyone would die, and then, uh... and then...\"<br/><br/>She pauses for a while to think, looking as if she were having a hard time trying to describe what happened to her.<br/><br/>\"And then her eyes became bright red and the whole aura around her body was set aflame,\" Illuna says. \"Next thing you know, she could easily locate your whereabouts from anywhere on the ethereal plane, and she could traverse long distances almost instantaneously. I'm still not entirely certain how that happened, but based on the little amount of information I have at my disposal, I'm going to assume that it was something akin to a next stage of evolution that is specific to ethereals, or something along those lines.\"<br/><br/>",

Oh, and I don't know if you remember this, but Flower's eyes were also glowing with a bright red color that one time when she fought Eiden before we went into Thilias. This.... 'stage of evolution', as you called it, might be something related to their emotional state, because both Flower and Diane were either really angry or really determined whenever their eyes started shining.\"<br/>\"Uhm...\" Flower says, \"I'd really love to stay here and chat but I'm kind of starting to get a little worried that the others might also try to breathe, like Barry almost did, so I'd better go bring them quickly to my house just to be safe. I'll be right back!\"<br/><br/>She then gets covered in a white light, and she teleports out of the room.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Illuna,\" I say after a little while, \"can you by any chance see what's going on in the earthen plane?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"We're inside Flower's mind right now, so I can control her body.\"<br/><br/>\"What happened to our earthen bodies?\" I say. \"Are they unconscious, or?...\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, your bodies are unconscious, but they are unhurt,\" Illuna says. \"Nobody is moving at this time. Not even the drones. The only one awake in the area where the fight was taking place aside from myself is Arraka, who is ranting about how we can't even defend ourselves against a measly attack on our souls from the ethereal plane.\"<br/>\"If the drones are not moving, then could it be possible that the Overseer also displaced his own soul by mistake?\" I ask. \"Otherwise, I don't see any reason why he wouldn't at least try to capture the rebels while they're collapsed on the ground.\"<br/><br/>\"We'll have to ask Flower if she can sense him somewhere in the ether once she comes back,\" Illuna says. \"If he is out there, then your theory will become very likely.\"<br/><br/>\"Does Flower also know where our minds are?\" I hear Leila's inner voice talking, while her mouth is closed. \"I have no recollection of getting thrown out of my mind, so I can't help her with directions even if she can teleport me there.\"<br/><br/>\"Unfortunately no, she does not seem to be able to detect where your minds are,\" Illuna says. \"That's why she had to bring you all here, to her own mind, as a temporary measure.\"<br/><br/>\"Her mind?...\" Hadrik asks, all of a sudden. \"What do you mean her mind? Isn't this her house?\"<br/><br/> \"No, this is not a real house,\" Illuna says, looking slightly irritated. \"We've already talked about this. She made it look like a house, but in reality, this is the inside of her mind. She has complete control over this place and she can turn it into anything she wants.\"<br/>\"But how does--\" Hadrik starts to say, but then he interrupts himself. \"Ugh... Never mind. Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, here. Ever since I came to Flower's house, I've been trying really hard to not think of anything so that you guys wouldn't hear my thoughts, but the problem is that when I'm so focused on not thinking out loud by accident, I can barely follow anything of what you're saying! How are you guys making conversation so casually without jumbling your spoken words with your inner thoughts? I don't get it!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, uh...\" I say, as Leila and I exchange a look. \"Illuna's been here for a long time, so it must come naturally to her by now. As for me and Leila, I think it's because we've already been to the ethereal plane once before, and we kind of got the general idea of how this 'thinking out loud' stuff works.\"<br/><br/>\"Ah, so you two are already experts in the field, then!\" Hadrik says. \"As an expert, you wouldn't happen to have some advice for a beginner like myself, would you, Barry?\"<br/><br/>",

I guess she cares more for Flower than she lets on.<br/><br/> \"We can all hear what you're thinking,\" Illuna says, as she is staring at me with a frown. \"You know this, don't you?\"<br/>\"Oh, right,\" I say, a little embarrassed. \"It was actually not my intention to say it out loud. Sorry about that!\"<br/><br/>\"The tea is ready!\" we hear Flower, who was in the kitchen this whole time and didn't hear our previous conversation. \"I'll bring it right away!\"<br/><br/>She comes back a few seconds later with a kettle in her hand, and she starts pouring tea into our cups, one by one.<br/><br/>\"Hey, this isn't bad!\" Daren says, as he takes a sip of tea from his cup. \"What kind of leaves did you use to make this tea?\"<br/><br/> \"I'm not sure...\" Flower says. \"I just imagined the taste that I wanted the tea to have and then I conjured the leaves. I don't think they actually exist in the real world.\"<br/>\"The cookies are based on a recipe that you were using on the earthen plane, correct?\" Melindra says, after she takes one bite. \"I remember you creating some very similar cookies using the food creation spell of the golden fox.\"<br/><br/>\"They are similar, but not exactly the same,\" Flower says. \"The food creation spell is amazing, but it's still very limiting compared to what I can do here in my mind. In here, I can replicate any taste from the real world, and I can also create tastes that don't exist, using only my imagination! I have so much more freedom in this place. It's great!\"<br/><br/>",

When we're done with the ones that I know, however, things start becoming a little more difficult.<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" Melindra says, after she sees me fail a spell that she just explained to me. \"Give me a second. I'm trying to figure out how to explain this in a way that makes sense for someone who is used to learning magic from books and not through trial and error.\"<br/>\"I mean, I'm fine with trial and error too, as long as it doesn't take too long,\" I say. \"How do you usually learn new spells?\"<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Melindra says, \"I'm not sure how magic works on this plane of existence, since I can't seem to get it to work myself, but what I normally do is that I try to, uh... resonate with the correct frequency of the magical energy that builds up inside me while casting the spell. Does that make sense to you?\"<br/><br/>\"I think it does, yeah...\" I say. \"That's how you cast spells as an elementalist, right? I remember doing something similar when I had my magic stats unlocked during my fights with Tyrath and the stillwater skeletons. The problem is that I don't really feel any energy inside me while I'm casting spells in this realm, so I can't make use of this information. Isn't there anything you could tell me about the direction of the flow? For example... what direction do you instinctively look at when you start casting the spell? What about afterwards? I'm pretty sure that the way you move your eyes as an elementalist should be the most indicative of the direction that the flow of magic is supposed to take.\"<br/><br/> \"Let me try it now,\" Melindra says, as she gets into a stance, closes her eyes and then tries to visualize the non-existent magical energy from this plane of existence. \"It starts with the upper left, then it goes all the way down, then it slowly goes back up heading towards the right until--\"<br/>\"Perfect!\" I say. \"That's all I needed to know.\"<br/><br/>\"Really?\" Melindra asks. \"That's it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I've studied many thousands of spells, so I can usually detect a pattern pretty quickly if I've seen it a few times before. As luck would have it, this is one of the more common patterns when it comes to magic flows, so I'm pretty confident that I know where it goes from here. I'll give it a try, and you can correct my movements if I'm too far off-course. Here we go!\"<br/><br/>After I manage to cast the spell that Melindra was trying to teach me, we use the same learning method for the next few spells, and it works flawlessly. As I am focusing on learning as many spells as possible in the limited time we have at our disposal, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing.<br/><br/>",
