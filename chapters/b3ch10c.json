Deitrah... Dengah...\"<br/><br/>\"A Dedra stone,\" Flower and I say at the same time, without thinking.<br/><br/>\"Yes, a Dedra stone!\" Eiden says, looking both surprised and impressed by our answer. <br/><br/>He then takes a look towards me and Flower, and then another look towards Kate, who had been watching his every move and was readying a few icicles ever since he began walking closer to Melindra.<br/><br/>\"Congratulations, Melindra,\" Eiden says. \"It looks like you've made some good friends while I was away!\"<br/><br/>\"I'll take the stone,\" Melindra says, as she quickly grabs the rock from his hand, while looking slightly embarrassed, \"and I'll consider it as a form of apology, but don't think that you're off the hook just yet!\"<br/><br/>\"Of course, of course,\" Eiden says, with his usual polite smile.<br/><br/> \"So, would you mind telling us the reason for your visit, or do you expect us to guess?\" Illuna says.<br/>\"All in good time, Illuna of the sacred woods massacre,\" Eiden says. \"But first, I would like to ask a slightly unrelated question. Wasn't there supposed to be a white mage in your group? Whatever happened to Daren? You know... dark-skinned fellow... very tall... wears armor all the time?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm right here, jackass,\" Daren says. \"Don't act like you don't see me.\"<br/><br/>\"My good sir, you must be mistaken,\" Eiden tells him. \"Aside from your obvious lack of heavy armor, the Daren that I know would have tried to kill me with the first opportunity, or at the very least, he would have looked at me as if he were ready to slit my throat at any given moment. I do not remember having had any other conversations with you since the last time I saw you, so what has changed, exactly?\"<br/><br/>\"That's right, you don't remember...\" Daren says, in a thoughtful voice. \"You would have no way of remembering, in fact...\"<br/><br/>\"I beg your pardon?\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>\"Let's just say that a... different version of yourself from another world has given me a helping hand when I was at my lowest point,\" Daren says, \"and because of that, I am willing to take a somewhat more lenient attitude towards you, at least for the time being.\"<br/><br/>\"...You are talking about the God of Time's trials?\" Eiden asks, in a more serious tone than usual.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Daren answers, simply.<br/><br/> \"I see,\" Eiden says, as he spends a few seconds in quiet contemplation before he speaks again. \"In that case, I should probably give you a warning. This may sound obvious to you, but that Eiden and I are not the same person. We do not share the same memories, and based on how old that version of me was, he may have had a completely different outlook on life than the one I have now. I do not know what he's said to you, or how far you've been sent into the past, but you should not make the mistake of thinking that anything you've discussed in that trial applies to this world. Believing otherwise will likely only set you up for disappointment.\"<br/>\"Don't worry,\" Daren says. \"I'm not planning to make that mistake.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" Eiden says. \"Now that we've got that settled, perhaps it is time to change the topic of conversation to one of the two main subjects that I've come here to talk to you about. First of all, let us discuss Ollendor. Tell me, Barry, what do you think about their new king?\"<br/><br/>",

In order to counteract this, the king of the underground had his men spread rumors for a day or two, making sure that the majority of the population would find out for themselves about the state of the prisoners and about the horrors that they have endured all this time at the hands of the previous king and his underlings. As a result, people very quickly took to the streets in order to request that all the prisoners should be freed at once, and naturally the goblin was very happy to comply with their demands.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I get it!\" I say. \"And since the people themselves were the ones who asked for the prisoners' release, they could no longer complain about the flying vehicles no longer working, right?\"<br/><br/><% } %> After saying this, we both remain silent for about five seconds or so, until I finally decide that I should probably be the one to continue our conversation.<br/>\"So... is this all you wanted to ask, then?\" I tell Eiden.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Eiden says. \"Regarding this topic, at least.\"<br/><br/>\"What about the second topic that you wanted to discuss with us?\" Kate says, while frowning.<br/><br/>\"It's funny that you should ask this question, Kate of the Beacon of Hope,\" Eiden says, \"since the next subject of conversation probably concerns you the most, out of the whole group.

After I found out, I thought that I could keep this a secret and meet with Meridith myself to get the pinecone detector, but she wouldn't have it. She kept questioning me on the transceiver about what I needed the device for, and who I was travelling with, and when I gave her the name of Daren, she somehow immediately made the connection that you would be in the same group, and asked to meet you, specifically. She said that unless you personally came to request the pinecone detector from her, she would never give it to me. Kate, I know how this sounds, but I promise I can fix this! I KNOW I can fix this somehow! I just need a little more time!\"<br/><br/>During Melindra's speech, there was an ever-growing murmur in the background, from Daren, Hadrik, Illuna and Flower talking to each other in a worried tone, while Arraka was laughing hysterically from within her amulet. As I was trying to figure out my own feelings on the matter, I suddenly noticed that Eiden had been smirking at me this entire time, with his eyes closed, as usual.<br/><br/>\"Aren't you glad, Barry?\" Eiden tells me, once he sees me looking at him. \"Now you'll finally get the chance to deliver my message!\"<br/><br/>That's right... Eiden's message. I had completely forgotten about it, with everything that's been going on lately. Does this mean that he still wants me to deliver it to the lessathi after all this time?<br/><br/> \"Melindra, look at me,\" Kate tells Melindra, as she puts her hands on her shoulders. \"I need you to breathe deeply and relax. Can you do that for me?\"<br/>\"Yes, I can do that!\" Melindra says, and then she starts taking deep breaths, one after the other, even though it is obvious that she is forcing herself to do it and that she is not relaxing at all. \"Okay, what next?\"<br/><br/>\"Now I want you to listen closely to what I'm about to say,\" Kate says. \"It is not a problem for me to meet with Meridith personally. You can go ahead and arrange the meeting.\"<br/><br/>\"It's not?\" Melindra asks, looking very confused. \"I can?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Kate says. \"Perhaps a little more than a week ago I would have said something different, but while I was in the first trial of the God of Time's ritual, I received a lot of help from Meridith. In fact, without Meridith's help, I would have almost certainly ended up dead. As things stand, I feel like I at least owe her the benefit of the doubt, considering that my good friend Diane also told me herself that she was working with Meridith of her own free will. \"<br/><br/>\"So... I can call Meridith?\" Melindra says. \"Can I tell her that we'll meet her whenever she wants?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, you can,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Wow... this is... I can't tell you how much of a relief this is!\" Melindra says. \"I thought for sure that you would try to kill me if I told you this. Or at least that you would put a dagger to my throat and pin me to a tree!\"<br/><br/> \"Of course not,\" Kate says. \"I would never do that to a friend.\"<br/>She then turns towards me, giving me a look suggesting that she knows I'm the one who told Melindra about her putting a dagger to my throat.<br/><br/>\"Isn't that right, Barry?\" she says.<br/><br/>\"Yes, yes, of course,\" I say. \"Melindra was just overreacting. There was never anything to be worried about!\"<br/><br/>\"In that case, I'll go make the required preparations to contact her right now!\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Go ahead,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"See you in a bit,\" Melindra says, as she flies away from us.<br/><br/>\"Well, I believe this concludes the business that I had with your group,\" Eiden says. \"I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other again soon.\"<br/><br/>\"You know where to find us,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>",

She never said anything about protecting her.\"<br/><br/>\"This girl will die if you don't do what I say!\" the revenant says. \"Do you understand?\"<br/><br/> \"I have no problem with you killing her,\" Eiden says, with a smile. \"In fact, you would be doing me a favor. After all, she is the only human being who can currently be possessed by Arraka, if she were ever to get out of that amulet.\"<br/>Following Eiden's reply, there is a brief pause during which the revenant just stares at him, probably trying to figure out if he's bluffing or not.<br/><br/>\"Go on...\" Eiden says, after a few more seconds of silence. \"What are you waiting for? Do it.\"<br/><br/>The revenant presses the knife closer to Flower's neck, but her expressionless eyes are now showing a hint of hesitation. Despite what she said in the past about being only a tool for the God of Death, it does seem like she still has her own free will. Maybe I can talk her out of this, somehow.<br/><br/>",

However, contrary to our expectations, our guide was not a lessathi, but a twenty-three-year-old woman with a slim but muscular physique, a burn scar on her left arm and short blond hair that was standing up on its own, due to the static electricity constantly building up around her.<br/>\"Diane!\" Kate says, loudly. \"It's really you!\"<br/><br/>\"You never listen, do you?...\" Diane says, in a defeated tone. \"I warned you to leave this place, and yet you still somehow managed to make your way back to--\"<br/><br/>Diane doesn't get to finish what she was saying, because Kate rushes towards her and hugs her tightly in her arms.<br/><br/>\"I got you,\" Kate says, as she tightens her grip on her friend. \"And you're not getting away. Not this time.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, hey, let me go!\" Diane says, as she tries to break herself free from Kate's powerful hold. \"You're embarrassing me in front of your friends!\"<br/><br/> \"We finally meet again, eh?\" Hadrik tells Diane. \"You know, we went through a lot of trouble because of you. After you left us unconscious in the middle of the sacred woods, we were captured by the golden fox and nearly got killed several times.\"<br/>\"You did?!\" Diane says, as she manages to escape Kate's grasp, looking very shocked. \"I'm sorry! I--I didn't know-- I didn't think--\"<br/><br/>\"Hahaha!\" Hadrik laughs. \"Calm down, I was only teasing you a little. As you can see, we are all very much alive, and we got some good adventures out of it, so all's well when it ends well!\"<br/><br/>\"...Right,\" Diane says, in an uncertain tone. \"I... really do owe you all an apology, though. I shouldn't have treated you the way I did. It's just that... I was so desperate to keep Kate from coming into contact with the lessathi that I-- I acted without thinking. I always do stupid things like this when I'm under great amounts of stress. It's an old, bad habit of mine that I've never really managed to shake off even after all this time. Anyway, I'm really, really, really sorry! I promise that I'll find a way to make it up to you!\"<br/><br/> \"Hmm...\" Daren says. \"If you were so worried about Kate meeting the lessathi, then why are you working for them? They're not threatening you or anything, are they?\"<br/>\"No, no, nothing like that,\" Diane says. \"To put it simply, I am working with Meridith, but not with the other lessathi.\"<br/><br/>\"But... isn't she their leader?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"In a way,\" Diane says. \"The lessathi are in a fractured state at the moment, and they have been like this for many years, ever since the death of their last leader, Heksol. They do not openly challenge Meridith's authority, but many of them have been actively working against her interests since the very beginning of her instatement as the new leader of the lessathi. Meridith believes that she will one day be able to reform them all, and make them change their ways, although I am a lot more skeptical.\"<br/><br/>",

Is it because of Jason?\"<br/>\"He is part of the reason, yes...\" Diane says. \"My brother has always admired Meridith, and he wouldn't leave her side no matter what, but there's also the fact that I know what the lessathi can do if left to their own devices, and I do not want another Beacon of Hope to happen ever again. Meridith has gone through great lengths to fix as much of the damage that has been done by that orphanage program as possible, and she has also banned the great majority of the barbaric practices that were being done by lessathi in the past, such as treating their children who had disabilities as social rejects, and sentencing the lessathi who left their community to death. I respect her for doing all these things, and that is why I still work alongside her to this day.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not sure what to make of everything you've just said,\" Daren says. \"On the one hand, I'm glad that Meridith seems to be someone who can be reasoned with, but on the other hand it feels like she doesn't have a lot of control over her own people. What is to guarantee that they won't try to capture us or worse as soon as we teleport into their domain?\"<br/><br/> \"Daren makes a good point,\" Kate says. \"Diane, are you sure that it's safe for us to go meet Meridith in the lessathi's own base of operations?\"<br/>\"There's no need for you to worry about that,\" Diane says.<br/><br/>\"Why not?\" Kate asks.<br/><br/>\"Because if any of them so much as try to hurt you, I will kill them,\" Diane says, as her eyes are now shining with a bright yellow light. \"I will kill them all, and they know I can do it. Trust me, they won't dare to lay a hand on you.\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Flower gasps loudly, and she points towards Diane.<br/><br/>\"You can do the thing with the shiny eyes!\" Flower says, looking very excited. \"That's so cool! I didn't think I'd ever find someone else who can do this. I can do it too, look!\"<br/><br/> She then squeezes her fists and concentrates really hard, while her eyes gradually begin to shine with a red color, and her aura feels like it's burning up.<br/>\"Yes, this is... a highly advanced ethereal technique,\" Diane says, looking very impressed by what Flower is showing her. \"Normally, it should only be achievable after years of hard work and practice. I am surprised that you can already do it at such a young age.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not young!\" Flower says. \"I'm thirty years old, and I'm pretty sure that I'm older than you!\"<br/><br/>\"Um... okay?...\" Diane says, and then she turns to us. \"Is she joking, or?...\"<br/><br/>",

I would have never thought that such a thing would be possible...\"<br/><br/>\"So, umm, sorry to interrupt,\" Hadrik says, \"but is this where we are supposed to be teleported from, or do we need to go somewhere else?\"<br/><br/> \"We need to go somewhere else, but it's not far from here,\" Diane says. \"Come on, I'll show you!\"<br/>\"Diane, there are so many things that I want to talk to you about!\" Kate says, as we are walking with Diane towards the teleportation area. \"So many things that you don't know. I've found Leila! We've been travelling together!\"<br/><br/>\"Leila?...\" Diane says, looking as if she were having a hard time remembering who that was. \"Oh, the mute girl with silver hair who escaped with the caretaker. She was still alive? Good for her!\"<br/><br/>\"She has a way to talk now,\" Kate says. \"She uses a device that reads her thoughts and puts them into floating letters, forming words, so that we can all read them. We became very good friends. I'll make sure to introduce her to you some day. I'm sure you'll love her!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sure I will,\" Diane says.<br/><br/>On our way to our destination, Kate continues to talk with Diane for a few more minutes, during which she tries to summarize as much as she can about what she has done since she was sent away from Varathia, and about what has happened to us during the tournament.<br/><br/>When we arrive at the point of teleportation, Diane grabs her transceiver and she calls the person in charge of handling the teleporting device. Once they are done with their conversation, Diane asks us one last time if we are okay with this, and then she gives the lessathi the signal to transport us to their lair.<br/><br/> The teleportation occurs similarly to how we've been accustomed by the rebels of Ollendor. First we are enveloped by the usual bright white light while our bodies vibrate loudly, then we find ourselves in a cavern next to a teleporter device looking almost identical to the one in Ollendor, except that it's a little bigger.

She doesn't look older than nine, or maybe ten at most!\"<br/><br/>\"It's because her soul has been fused with a banshee, named Illuna,\" I say. \"They now share the same body and they both live together inside Flower's mind on the ethereal plane, where they eat cookies and drink tea every day.\"<br/><br/>\"A banshee...\" Diane says. \"I suppose that would explain why her aura felt so different, but to share the same body and even live inside the same mind?... I would have never thought that such a thing would be possible...\"<br/><br/>\"So, umm, sorry to interrupt,\" Hadrik says, \"but is this where we are supposed to be teleported from, or do we need to go somewhere else?\"<br/><br/> \"We need to go somewhere else, but it's not far from here,\" Diane says. \"Come on, I'll show you!\"<br/>\"Diane, there are so many things that I want to talk to you about!\" Kate says, as we are walking with Diane towards the teleportation area. \"So many things that you don't know. I've found Leila! We've been travelling together!\"<br/><br/>\"Leila?...\" Diane says, looking as if she were having a hard time remembering who that was. \"Oh, the mute girl with silver hair who escaped with the caretaker. She was still alive? Good for her!\"<br/><br/>\"She has a way to talk now,\" Kate says. \"She uses a device that reads her thoughts and puts them into floating letters, forming words, so that we can all read them. We became very good friends. I'll make sure to introduce her to you some day. I'm sure you'll love her!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sure I will,\" Diane says.<br/><br/>On our way to our destination, Kate continues to talk with Diane for a few more minutes, during which she tries to summarize as much as she can about what she has done since she was sent away from Varathia, and about what has happened to us during the tournament.<br/><br/>When we arrive at the point of teleportation, Diane grabs her transceiver and she calls the person in charge of handling the teleporting device. Once they are done with their conversation, Diane asks us one last time if we are okay with this, and then she gives the lessathi the signal to transport us to their lair.<br/><br/> The teleportation occurs similarly to how we've been accustomed by the rebels of Ollendor. First we are enveloped by the usual bright white light while our bodies vibrate loudly, then we find ourselves in a cavern next to a teleporter device looking almost identical to the one in Ollendor, except that it's a little bigger.

I offer this to you as an apology for all the suffering that my people have caused you in the past. I realize that it won't make up for all those agonizing years spent in the Beacon, but at the very least it should serve as a--\"<br/><br/>\"Sacrilege!!!\" shouts the lessathi who is operating the teleporter. \"This is unheard of! Unimaginable! Do you think that the holy scepter of Heldenbusorag is some cheap souvenir that you can just give out to random visitors? How dare you mock our heritage in such a way!\"<br/><br/>\"I am not mocking anyone,\" Meridith says, calmly. \"The importance that this relic has to our people is exactly what gives it value as an apology. There would be no point in giving it to her otherwise.\"<br/><br/>\"I-- I can't accept this!\" Kate says, as she takes a step back. \"If it's so important to you, then you should keep it.\"<br/><br/> \"Please take it,\" Meridith says, as she gently grabs Kate's hand and then places the scepter in her palm. \"This relic would be of much more use in your hands than it would be collecting dust in our treasury. For a mage like yourself, it should greatly help with focusing your energy during attacks. Give it a try.\"<br/>\"...Alright,\" Kate says, hesitantly, as she holds the scepter forward, and she shoots an icicle into one of the walls.<br/><br/>The icicle easily penetrates the thick seredium wall, and it goes all the way through, making a deep hole inside it.<br/><br/>\"I'll admit that I wasn't expecting it to work so well,\" Kate says, in an impressed tone. \"Normally, it would have taken me a lot more time to magically sharpen and reinforce an icicle to such a degree.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm glad to know that it works well for you,\" Meridith says.<br/><br/>\"I assure you that the Heksol faction will be quite displeased with your actions, Lady Meridith,\" says the lessathi teleporting engineer, who seems to have calmed down a little since his last outburst. \"I will tell them about this matter, personally.\"<br/><br/> \"There is no need to inform them,\" Meridith says. \"I've already made my plans public shortly after I invited Kate and her friends here. And even if they had doubts on whether I would go through with it or not, they will surely find out that I was being serious when they will see the scepter in Kate's hands. Times are changing, Grihirt. You and your faction will just need to accept this. Heksol has been dead for years, and yet you still name your group after him. At some point, you will have to accept reality for what it is.\"<br/>\"We will see about that,\" Grihirt says, in an acid tone.<br/><br/>\"Let us go,\" Meridith tells us. \"It is a long way from here to our main base of operations, so we should be on our way.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" Daren says, as we begin to follow her through the dark tunnels lit by torches, while leaving the disgruntled lessathi behind.<br/><br/>\"I realize that I may have been a little unreasonable when I asked you to come here if you wanted the pinecone detector,\" Meridith says, while we are walking behind her, \"but I promise you that you will not regret your decision. I may not be able to erase what the lessathi have done to you in the past, but I am most certainly going to make them compensate you a hundredfold for your troubles.\"<br/><br/>\"Why are you going so far out of your way to help us?\" Illuna says. \"I thought that tournament organizers were supposed to remain neutral towards the participants.\"  <br/><br/>",

Therefore, I intend to pay that debt to her in small installments whenever I get the opportunity. If there is anything that you need.... anything at all, please do not hesitate to ask me, and I will do my best to accommodate your wishes.\"<br/>\"I don't recall having introduced myself,\" Illuna says. \"Could I be so bold as to inquire how you knew my name?\"<br/><br/>\"I am the leader of the lessathi,\" Meridith says. \"I make it one of my top priorities to know as much as possible about what happens in Varathia. You two have made quite a name for yourselves in the past twenty years, and it is also rumored that you have the golden fox's protection. It is only natural that I would at least know who you are.\"<br/><br/>\"Fair enough,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>Meridith now pokes one of the seredium walls a few times with a small metal rod, and a secret door opens up, allowing us to go into a hidden tunnel.<br/><br/> \"You mentioned earlier that we could ask for anything we wanted,\" I say, as we enter the tunnel and the door closes itself behind us. \"Does this include classified information? Because there's this secret code that is supposed to unlock the magical stats from my stat device, but from what I understood, only the highest ranking lessathi are supposed to have knowledge of it.\"<br/>\"I do know the code that you are looking for, but I think you may have been slightly misled,\" Meridith says, while we continue to walk through the semi-lit corridor. \"The magical stats do not work for regular lessathi. They only work for half-lessathi. That is actually the main reason why the two stats were even locked, since half-lessathi were seen as inferior, and could not be allowed to wield such power. My guess is that these stats have not been removed entirely from the devices because the lessathi from six or seven hundred years ago who created them were likely still hoping to find a way around this problem, up until the moment when they were all nearly annihilated during the still winter. At any rate, even if I do unlock these stats for you, you won't be able to use them.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, I'm a half-lessathi, not a regular one,\" I say. \"I already tested those stats during Emergency Mode, so I know that they work for me.\"<br/><br/>\"You're a half-lessathi?...\" Meridith says. \"No, that can't be right. Romantic relationships between lessathi and humans are strictly prohibited by our community. And besides, if you came here as a tournament participant, it must mean that you were living somewhere outside Varathia. This means that you or your parents must have somehow--\"<br/><br/> Meridith suddenly stops in her tracks and she turns around to look at me, examining me from head to toe.<br/>\"May I ask what your age is?\" Meridith asks me, after a long pause. \"You don't look older than thirty.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, I am twenty-eight years old,\" I answer her.<br/><br/>\"Twenty-eight years...\" Meridith says, as she seems to be doing some calculations inside her head. \"That is exactly how much time it's been since--\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"No, it can't be!\" Meridith continues. \"But what if--\"<br/><br/>She now uses the rod made of metal from before to tap her left shoulder once, and then she lightly taps my shoulder as well. Shortly upon contact with me, the tip of the rod begins to glow with a bright green light, while Meridith just stares at it, in complete silence.<br/><br/>\"Our auras match...\" Meridith says, as she still seems to be recovering from the shock of what she's just seen. <br/><br/>\"And what does that mean?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"It means that we are related by blood,\" Meridith says.<br/><br/>",

The only thing he was able to do at the time was to fire me from my position as his secretary. What happened afterwards was that I eventually climbed the ranks through my own skills, and years later he was forced to accept me as his second-in-command despite his misgivings.\"<br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"I am... really sorry that I never tried looking for you,\" Meridith tells me. \"When I said goodbye to my sister, we agreed that we would exchange no contact information whatsoever, so there would be no danger that her enemies would somehow find out her new address from me. I only learned about their deaths much later, from some hidden documents that I stumbled upon while rearranging the files from Heksol's older office. I didn't know your name, your place of birth, or even if you were still alive by that time. I couldn't think of any way to find you, except for roaming the continents myself with this metal wand in my hand, hoping that someday its tip would turn green. To think that you would simply show up on my doorstep after all these years...\"<br/><br/>\"So, what do we do now?\" I say. \"Do we hug?\"<br/><br/> \"No...\" Meridith says. \"But your sudden appearance couldn't have come at a better time. There is someone very important that I want you to meet. I was going to take you all to see him anyway because I wanted to introduce Kate to him, but now that I know who you are, it makes much more sense that you should meet him as well.\"<br/>\"Who is this person that you want to introduce me to?\" I say. \"Is it another lessathi?\"<br/><br/>\"You will see soon enough,\" Meridith says. \"Come with me. We should not be wasting any more time.\"<br/><br/>As we continue to travel through the deserted hidden corridors, I suddenly get a cold shiver down my spine, because I am only just now remembering Eiden's last words towards me:<br/><br/>\"Aren't you glad, Barry? Now you'll finally get the chance to deliver my message!\"<br/><br/>Eiden's message... <br/><br/>'Remember the still winter'. A phrase that is clearly worded as a threat. How is Meridith going to react when I tell her this? Will she have us imprisoned, even though I'm supposedly her nephew and Kate is Diane's friend? Will she fly into a fit of rage? Is the message even supposed to be taken as a threat at all? The stillwaters did fight the lessathi during the still winter, but from what Melindra told us, Eiden was supposed to have taken the lessathi's side in that war. Maybe it's not as bad as it sounds. Maybe it's only meant as a friendly warning of sorts.<br/><br/>",

I cannot afford to take that risk again.<br/>\"Umm, Meridith,\" I say, while we are still walking through one of the tunnels. \"I realize this is going to feel a bit sudden, but I just remembered that I have a message for you. It's... from Eiden.\"<br/><br/>\"From Eiden?\" Meridith says, as she once again stops walking, but this time she doesn't turn to look at me. \"What message could he possibly have for me?\"<br/><br/>\"He told me that the message is: 'Remember the still winter.' \" I say.<br/><br/>There is no reaction from Meridith. Only silence.<br/><br/>\"He... didn't tell me anything else,\" I say. \"He said you would understand as soon as you'd hear these words.\"<br/><br/>\"You are sure that this was his exact phrasing?\" Meridith asks me, as she now begins to slowly walk forward again. \"There is no mistaking it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, I'm sure of it,\" I say, as the rest of us move to follow her.<br/><br/>\"Did he ask you to deliver this message to me, specifically?\" Meridith says.<br/><br/> \"Well, no, not exactly,\" I say. \"At first, I was supposed to deliver it to the first lessathi that I came across, but I couldn't really do that, because I was barely conscious at the time. Eiden got really pissed off when he found out that I didn't deliver his message despite coming into contact with some lessathi, so this time I had to make sure that I fulfilled his request properly.\"<br/>\"How did he know that you came into contact with some lessathi?\" Meridith says. \"Were you the one who told him?\"<br/><br/>\"No, he figured it out himself,\" I say. \"He has this crazy-powerful magical sense that he can use to pinpoint everyone's aura from all around the continent, and he found out from our auras that I came near a few lessathi.\"<br/><br/>\"What did you just say?!\" Meridith asks in a much louder voice than before, as she now turns around to face me again.<br/><br/>\"I don't know,\" I say, confused. \"Which part?\"<br/><br/>\"Did you just state that Eiden was able to figure out that you met some lessathi just from their auras?\" Meridith says.<br/><br/> \"I mean, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how he was able to detect them,\" I say. \"Like I said, he can detect auras from extremely large distances.\"<br/>\"You don't understand!\" Meridith says. \"We lessathi are always wearing bracelets under our sleeves, with the specific purpose of remaining undetected. If Eiden could detect our men from so far away, then the bracelets are meaningless!\"<br/><br/>\"Ahahahahaha!\" Arraka laughs all of a sudden. \"You thought that those poorly-made trinkets could keep you hidden from Eiden? They would need to be at least a hundred times stronger for something like that to work!\"<br/><br/>\"A hundred times stronger, you say?...\" Meridith asks, looking as if she were actually seriously considering Arraka's suggestion. \"I think that might be doable. We're probably going to have to recycle some of the bracelets and combine their parts together, but at least our scouts will be safer than they are now. I will tell our tinkerers to start working on this as soon as I return to our base.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, good luck with that,\" Arraka says, in a sarcastic tone.<br/><br/>",

Should I be grateful to him that he changed his mind and switched sides at the very end, after his friends had already killed the majority of the lessathi population? The still winter was nothing close to a war! It was a one-sided massacre, and every single stillwater who participated in it has blood on their hands!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, hey, HEY!\" Melindra interjects. \"Neither me, nor my brother, nor Eiden participated in this so-called massacre that you speak of. And it was the lessathi's own fault that it came to this! If they hadn't kept Eiden and all the other mages imprisoned, things would have never escalated to such a--\"<br/><br/>\"It was the lessathi's own fault?\" Meridith asks, furiously. \"Even the women and children? Are you saying that they deserved what they got?\"<br/><br/> \"I--\" Melindra says, looking as if she is hesitating to give a straight answer. \"I am not condoning what the stillwaters did. What I am saying is that they were not the ones who started it.\"<br/>\"Wait a minute...\" I say. \"Were the mages being imprisoned because the lessathi were experimenting on them and turning them into stillwaters? Is that how this whole war began?\"<br/><br/>\"Nobody knows how the stillwaters came to be, except for the stillwaters themselves,\" Meridith says, while giving Melindra a look of disdain. \"Eiden has made quite sure that the information remained hidden from anybody else, so that there wouldn't be another human strong enough to challenge him ever again.\"<br/><br/>\"So, you don't know how stillwaters are created either,\" I say. \"Interesting...\"<br/><br/> Meridith now taps the wall at the end of the dark corridor with her metal wand and another secret door opens, leading us into an almost blindingly bright tunnel, with its walls and ceiling filled with blue crystals. Just like when we were in the underground caverns of Ollendor, the crystals are pulsating every now and then, but they seem to be a little less active than they were four days ago.<br/>\"Wow, that's a lot of crystals!\" Hadrik says, as the door closes behind us.<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" Meridith says, as we now head towards the right side, where the crystals are more abundant. \"If you are worried about the crystals' peculiar behavior, you should know that they've been acting like this for more than four days, and no incidents have been reported until now. We're still trying to figure out what triggered this, but we haven't had any success just yet.\"<br/><br/>",

Run far away, before it--\"<br/>In less than a moment, the blue light from the sphere extends itself in our direction and it completely envelops us. The next thing I know is that I am floating somewhere in a world without dimensions, along with all of my friends, who are looking around themselves very confused. I do not get much time to understand what happened, because after only a few seconds I find myself back in the void where the Magium sent me the first time when it tried to erase me from existence.<br/><br/>A feeling of intense fear takes over me as I imagine myself spending another eternity in this place that defies all reason. Just like last time, I feel myself blinking in and out of existence several times in a row, and after every consecutive trip to that world of nothingness, I find myself back in the Magium's realm, together with all my friends, who are all sweating something fierce, with looks of sheer terror in their eyes, as they are probably trying to understand what had happened to them.<br/><br/>\"Barry...\" Kate says. \"Was this the void that you told me about before? I've heard you describe it, but I would have never imagined... never in my worst nightmares that it could be anything like this...\"<br/><br/>\"What is Arraka doing?\" Daren says, as he is trying very hard to remain calm and rational, despite the obvious tremble in his voice. \"Why isn't she casting the primordial spell?\"<br/><br/> \"I'm trying!\" Arraka shouts, in the same panicked voice that she had when she told us to run away. \"I'm trying, but it's not working! I can't target this Magium fragment at all! It's like it's not even there!\"<br/>Once again, I feel myself getting pulled into the void, but now it's worse than it was before. Something tells me that if this happens a few more times, I won't be able to come back.<br/><br/>\"Magium, wait!\" Flower shouts, with obvious desperation in her voice. \"Petal and I have helped you in the past! We can do it again! Just tell us what we need to do! Please!\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the blinking in and out of existence stops, and we are left just staring at each other in this nonsensical world that we've been brought into by force. The Magium's realm seems even more absurd now than the last time when I visited it with Arraka during the God of Time's ritual. The geometry of the place does not fit any rules that could be describable through words.<br/><br/>Logically speaking, there are no dimensions here, but I can still easily distinguish between each of my friends, even if their shapes have no outlines. The time feels like it flows forward, but also backwards. For example, I am quite certain that we've only been through this whole ordeal once, but in my mind I have experienced these events multiple times, including in reverse and in non-chronological order. <br/><br/> I don't get to analyze this world much further, because the Magium finally decides to respond to Flower, although its voice seems to be changing its timbre and tonality with every new phrase that it speaks, as if it were a different person every time.<br/>\"In the past, you may have helped,\" I hear the voice of an old man.<br/><br/>\"But in the present, you have not,\" the Magium continues, now in the voice of a young woman.<br/><br/>\"The prophecy has already been delivered,\" I hear an adolescent boy talking.<br/><br/>\"You should know full well what must be done,\" says the voice of a little girl.<br/><br/>\"We don't!\" Flower says, in an anxious tone. \"We really don't! We haven't even figured out who the two old enemies clashing are supposed to be, yet! I mean, I guess we're kind of expecting one of those enemies to be Eiden, since he pretty much spelled it out for us, but we're still not sure who the other--\"<br/><br/>\"Then you already have your answer,\" a woman interrupts Flower, in a soft-spoken voice.<br/><br/>\"In order for many lives to be saved, a single sacrifice is sometimes required,\" we now hear the voice of a small child, who is barely able to articulate his words.<br/><br/>\"A sacrifice?...\" Flower asks, in a somewhat fearful tone. \"You-- you want us to kill Eiden?\"<br/><br/>",

In the meantime, for some reason, I can't help but feel myself being drawn towards the blue sphere of light. It's like there is this invisible force pulling me closer to it.<br/>Despite the incredible danger that I've just been put through, the prize of the tournament is right there, in front of me. Could I possibly let this opportunity pass me by?<br/><br/>\"I never thought that there would be a Magium node so deep below the surface,\" I hear Arraka talking in the background. \"I was careless. I should not have let my guard down with all these seredium walls around me, blocking my magical sense.\"<br/><br/>\"What is a Magium node?\" Hadrik says. \"The big sphere of solid light? Is that what it's called?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Arraka says. \"There are several of these scattered throughout the continent of Varathia, and they're all linked together. That's why they're called nodes. Currently, they are more or less evenly split between the major powers of Varathia, so I suppose it would make sense that the lessathi should have one too, even if they're keeping it a secret.\"<br/><br/> \"The major powers of Varathia?\" Daren says. \"Like who? Tyrath? Eiden? The golden fox?\"<br/>\"Yes, those three, plus the kings of Varathia and also Fyron,\" Arraka says. \"The reason why they're so evenly split is because you don't really need more than one node to access the Magium, and there were enough of them lying around for every major player to obtain at least one without any need to fight over them. Also, they're really well hidden, so it's not like--\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, what do you think you're doing?!\" Daren says. \"Get away from there!\"<br/><br/>While the others were talking, I had been slowly getting closer and closer to the mysterious sphere of light, until I have gotten near enough to be able to touch it. Now that I see it up close, I realize that the sphere is bigger than me, and that the pitch-black center around which the solid blue light constantly rotates is made up of pure darkness. Somehow, despite all of this bright light spinning around it, the darkness is left completely intact, even though it should make no sense, from a logical point of view.<br/><br/> The sight of the sphere is truly mesmerizing, and I feel like I can barely take my eyes off it.<br/>\"Barry!\" Daren shouts. \"Don't do something you'll regret! Back away, slowly!\"<br/><br/>\"He actually went to the node!\" Arraka says. \"Ahahahahahahaha! Touch it, you loser! I dare you to touch it!\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"So, you want us to kill Eiden for you, is that it?\" Hadrik says.<br/>\"No,\" Meridith says. \"We will be the ones to deal with Eiden. That is the entire reason why we began amassing so much energy in the first place.\"<br/><br/>\"Then what is it that you want from us?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"I want you to be our backup plan, in case anything goes wrong,\" Meridith says. \"If there's anything that I've learned in the past few weeks, it is that no matter how carefully thought-out a plan is, it can still fail spectacularly if you are unlucky enough. That is why I'd like to have you as insurance. Don't worry, I'm not asking you to go on a suicide mission. Even if by some miracle, Eiden manages to survive until the end of the tournament, he will still be in a very weakened state after we're done with him. Weak enough that your group should have no trouble finishing him off. If you agree to provide assistance to us in such a scenario, I will personally grant you unlimited access to the Magium node that we visited together earlier.\"<br/><br/>\"Just to be clear, you don't have any intention of actually revealing your secret plans to us, do you?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid not,\" Meridith says. \"If by any chance, Eiden were to capture you and extract this information from you in some way, all of our efforts will have been in vain. I cannot allow that to happen.\"<br/><br/> \"You said that you would grant us access to the Magium if something went wrong with your plans and we offered to help,\" Kate says, \"but what if nothing bad happens? Let's assume that everything goes exactly the way you planned it and you kill Eiden without our help. What then?\"<br/>\"Then you would still gain access to the Magium,\" Meridith says. \"I'm not sure if you realize this, but in order for you to be our backup plan, I will need you to remain in Varathia until the end of the tournament. This means that you will need to keep participating in the contest and to complete your objectives, unless you want to risk being kicked out of the continent by the kings. As long as you are willing to make this effort, you deserve to have your prize, no matter what the outcome of our final confrontation with Eiden will be.\"<br/><br/>\"So, if we were to agree to help you, the kings would not know about our arrangement?\" Kate asks.<br/><br/>\"No,\" Meridith says. \"This deal is only between you and me. The kings do not know that we have a Magium node of our own, so they cannot find out that I'm willing to grant you access to it as a reward for your assistance. In other words, I am making this offer to you as the leader of the lessathi, not as an official organizer of the tournament. Let me repeat myself. All you have to do is continue to participate in the tournament, just like you were doing before, and to assist us against Eiden in the very unlikely scenario that our plan should fail, and you will ALL be granted the prize that you've been seeking this whole time, without even having to win the contest.\"<br/><br/> She then gets up from her chair, and looks at each of us in turn.<br/>\"I have given you my offer,\" Meridith says. \"Whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you.\"<br/><br/>She then pauses for a few seconds before she continues.<br/><br/>\"So...\" Meridith says. \"What is it going to be?\"<br/><br/>",

This book will have 12 chapters in total.<br/>I am very sorry for the huge delay. I've had a very bad stress-induced writer's block that started with the invasion of Ukraine (due to living in a neighboring country), and I haven't been able to regain the same writing speed since then.<br/><br/>I realize this isn't really an excuse, and I'm trying hard to regain a decent writing speed, but for the moment I had to split the remaining content until the end of book 3 into two separate chapters, due to the long distance between the checkpoints, so I decided to publish 'chapter 11' separately.<br/><br/>The final chapter was always meant to be split into two parts with a time skip between them, like chapter 10, so you can at least rest assured that the ending of chapter 11 won't leave you on a big cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Also, due to the many delays I've had in the past, I've decided to make the estimate much more vague this time, because I still don't know how fast I'll be able to write.<br/><br/>",
