I fully realize what this looks like, but we cannot confirm that our rules have been broken until we conduct a thorough investigation, in order to understand why our magical detectors were not set off. Until then, this mysterious participant will remain in our custody. Thank you for your understanding.\"<br/>\"Well...\" Bruce says. \"I guess the first round's over, then... Let's go back.\"<br/><br/>As we all head back, we run into the owner of the arena, who was waiting for us at the entrance to our division's area.<br/><br/>\"May I have an explanation for all of this?\" the owner says, looking straight at the lessathi. \"Who told you that you could just come in here and interfere with this arena event?\"<br/><br/>\"You know very well who did,\" the lessathi says. \"And you'd do well to step aside, and let me pass, if you know what's good for you.\"<br/><br/>\"How did you manage to fool the magic detectors?\" the owner says.<br/><br/>\"Did you forget who provided you with those magical detectors in the first place?\" the lessathi says. \"I only had to make a few small tweaks prior to the event, in order to get those devices to ignore electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"You are not to interfere with this event any longer, do you understand?\" the owner says, furiously. \"I want you out of here, right this instant!\"<br/>\"Are you sure?\" the lessathi asks him, with a menacing tone.<br/><br/>\"Get out!\" the owner tells him.<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" the lessathi says. \"Then you will not be seeing me again. You should, however, expect to see some of my associates in the next few days. And when you do, you should be ready to face the consequences for your actions today.\"<br/><br/>The lessathi leaves without another word, and the arena owner goes back to his room shortly afterwards. The six of us then re-enter our division area, and the iron gate closes itself behind us. After taking a good look throughout the room, it would seem that Wilhelm is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>\"Where do you suppose Wilbert went?\" Bruce says.<br/><br/>\"Nobody cares,\" the ex-noble thug says. \"There's plenty of time left until the next round. He'll probably come back until then.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh...\" the announcer says, all of a sudden. \"It appears that we need to take a small break, in order to do a little inventory of our remaining creatures. Please remain patient! This shouldn't take long!\"<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Bruce says. \"They're already running out of creatures. I bet they weren't expecting so many of them to be taken out in the first rounds!\"<br/><br/>",

Why would we not attack them in a group, like we did with these scorpions?\"<br/><br/>\"Because I want her to bait that manticore in the sky, while she's at it,\" I say. \"Even if I were to go and attack them, the manticore wouldn't come after me, after what I did to its friend, and neither of you would have enough strength to be able to pass through the tramplers' armor.\"<br/><br/>\"I'll do it,\" Leila writes. \"You deal with the cobras in the meantime.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" I say. \"You remember what the tramplers' weakness is, right?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I remember,\" Leila writes, and then she turns away, heading for the tramplers.<br/><br/>\"We can't just let her fight them alone like this!\" Bruce says, as Leila gets further away from us. \"What if she needs our help?\"<br/><br/>",

Seeing her out in the open, the tramplers have also decided to target her, and they are now charging towards her. Neither of them are giving signs that they'll be stopping anytime soon.<br/><br/>Now, if what I've read in all my notes is correct, the tramplers are much easier to intimidate than one would suspect. Tramplers are not used to being challenged on their own turf, so if you keep running towards them at full speed while they are charging at you, they will eventually stop charging, and back down. Leila knows of this weakness, and that's the reason why she's not stopping. Hopefully, everything will turn out okay.<br/><br/>After a few more seconds of running at each other, the two tramplers finally stop, about a dozen feet away from her, and they begin to swing their spiked mace tails towards her, in an attempt to intimidate her. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch4_backup || 0) == 1) {%> Perfect! This is the best scenario that Leila could be hoping for. A trampler's strength lies in its charges. A few tail swipes are only good to scare off dumb beasts. They're not going to inconvenience her. <br/>Leila jumps over one of the beasts and lands on its back, stabbing it in the back of its neck. Before the trampler even has time to fall to the ground, Leila already jumps off its back, in order to attack its companion. The second trampler barely has any time to react, before Leila gets below its head, running one of her knives straight through its lower jaw and all the way to its brain.<br/><br/>As soon as she gets away from the dying creature, the last remaining manticore makes a very fast dive towards her, in an attempt to surprise her. Leila feigns ignorance until the very last moment, and then she makes a powerful slash at the creature's chest, exactly when it reaches her. The manticore drops to the ground, and Leila finishes it off with one swift strike of her dagger.<br/><br/>\"See?\" I say to Bruce. \"I told you we didn't have anything to worry about. Now let's hurry up and kill those cobras before she gets here!\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

I hope that this will not affect your enjoyment of the show too much. Now, with all this said and done, I would like to introduce to you the fifth division!\"<br/>Back to their regular stock, huh? I guess that those griffins and gargoyles that we killed in the underground caverns two days ago must have been their last reserves, then. It's a good thing that we decided to deal with them ahead of time, or that crazy arena owner might well have thrown those against us too.<br/><br/>When the next iron gate gets raised, Kate is the first one to step out into the fighting area. As she proceeds to the middle of the arena, the other members of her division also start to follow in her footsteps. Once I get a good look at all of Kate's teammates, I get the sudden realization that Kate is likely the most capable fighter in her division, even without her magic. Most of the others look severely out of shape, and some of them don't even have weapons. These clearly aren't the types of gladiators that came here willingly.<br/><br/> As the unarmed fighters go to get their weapons of choice from the walls of the arena, the new creatures are slowly beginning to walk out of their den. <br/>The first ones to come out are pair of cave lions, which are basically larger versions of regular lions, but without the mane. Next, we see a few black wolves join the stage, which look similar to the ones we fought in the ogre shaman's illusion, except they're only about twice the size of regular wolves. As these creatures begin to slowly advance towards the middle of the arena, a few more black wolves and cave lions are making their appearance from behind the big iron gate. <br/><br/>So this is what they call their regular stock. It's definitely a step down from the creatures we've been shown so far, but something tells me that the organizers wouldn't have been permitted to release so many of them at the same time if this were one of their regular shows. If Kate had a decent team backing her up, then I wouldn't be worried, but as it stands, she may well be forced to fight all these creatures alone. <br/><br/>The first group of lions and wolves decides to take the initiative, and they begin to run together, towards the gladiators. When Kate's teammates see the beasts charge towards them, some of them start screaming and running away as fast as they can, while others charge right back at the creatures, in a desperate attempt to intimidate them.<br/><br/>",

I knew I should have killed them in the underground caves, where they couldn't use their wings to fly away. This is definitely not going to be an easy fight for Kate, even if I did tell her all these monsters' weaknesses.<br/><br/>The sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves are the first to attack. When Kate's teammates see the beasts charge towards them, some of them start screaming and running away as fast as they can, while others charge right back at the creatures, in a desperate attempt to intimidate them.<br/><br/>",

The real threats are the gargoyles and the griffins. With the gargoyles' strength and the griffins' size, I can see very few ways in which Kate would be able to win a fight against them, especially while they've got the air advantage.<br/><br/>The griffins are now beginning to descend towards the gladiators, and they quickly make their first victim. One of the more frail looking gladiators in Kate's group gets grabbed in a griffin's claws, and the beast starts to peck at the man's chest with its beak, while he is still alive. Hearing the man's cries for help, and his terrible screams, the other men abandon all pretense of courage, and they run away as fast as they can, in all directions. One of the other griffins comes down, and it tries to attack Kate.<br/><br/> Knowing the creature's behavior and attack patterns, Kate manages to step out of the way, and to slash at one of the creature's claws with her dagger, but she doesn't get to hurt the beast much before it flies back up, preparing itself for another dive.<br/>\"Things aren't looking very good for Kate,\" Leila writes to me. \"In the worst case scenario, she might even be forced to use her ice magic. You know what that means, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say. \"The punishment for using magic in the arena is death. In order to get out of here alive after that, she'd have to fight every single guard in the place, and to make this entire kingdom into her enemy.\"<br/><br/>\"And what would you do if that happened?\" Leila writes, looking at me with a very serious expression on her face. \"Would you join her, and make the kingdom into your enemy as well? Would you be willing to forsake the Magium tournament and your ambitions, in order to take her side on the battlefield?\"<br/><br/>",

The way I see it, they may as well be crowning us victors of this arena event right now, because there really isn't much of a point in dragging this any long--\"<br/><br/>\"Attention, all gladiators!\" the announcer says in a very loud voice, all of a sudden. <br/><br/>While I was talking with Leila, it seems that the final battle had already ended, and the warriors were now returning to their division area.<br/><br/> \"There has been a slight change in our fight schedule for the second round!\" the announcer continues. \"Unlike the first round, where the divisions have been fighting in the order of their division numbers, in this second round there will be one exception to the rule. By special request of our esteemed arena owner, mister Venard, the first division to fight Velgos in the second round will be none other than division number four! Gladiators of the fourth division, please make sure that you are ready! The fight will begin in the next few minutes.\"<br/>\"Humans!\" we hear the voice of Velgos the troll, shouting from the other end of the arena, as soon as the announcer stops talking. \"Your time is up! There is nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. All that awaits you is death. Blame your fate for having been unlucky enough to cross paths with Velgos the mercenary!\"<br/><br/>The crowds are going wild again, just like they did after Hadrik's first fight, and they're chanting the troll's name loudly over and over. <br/><br/>\"Velgos! Velgos! Velgos!\" they all keep chanting, as the troll waves to the crowd and makes intimidating gestures towards us, every once in a while.<br/><br/>\"Huh,\" I tell Leila. \"Well... damn.\"<br/><br/>",
