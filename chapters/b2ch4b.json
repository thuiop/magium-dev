The desert marauders are now also joining the battle, and it looks as if they're aiming to surround him. To make matters worse, the manticore decides to join the fight as well, and it dives down towards the lessathi, closing off his last remaining escape route.<br/>\"Get out of there!\" Bruce shouts at him. \"Get out now!\"<br/><br/>The lessathi shows no sign of having heard Bruce. Instead, he waits for the last possible moment, when the marauders, the tramplers and the manticore are all within a few feet from his position, and he thrusts both his scythes fiercely into the ground.

I should be the one to lead the team, not Bruce.\"<br/>\"If you're so keen on leading the team,\" the thug says, \"then why don't you go on ahead and attack those creatures over there. I promise we'll be right behind you.\"<br/><br/>\"Or better yet,\" I say, \"how about you shut the hell up and--\"<br/><br/>I stop talking mid-sentence because the blue robed lessathi suddenly makes a run towards the creatures, all by himself, with his scythes at the ready.<br/><br/>\"That crazy fool!\" Bruce says. \"Does he have a death wish?\"<br/><br/>The cobras see the lessathi, and they both spit in his direction. The lessathi dodges the spray of acid, and he moves to stab one of the cobras with his scythes. As soon as he stabs it, the giant snake falls on the ground, unconscious, and then he also stabs the second cobra, in the same manner, sending it falling to the ground almost as quickly as the first one.<br/><br/>One of the manticores sees this as an opportunity to attack, so it dives down with great speed, in an attempt to grab the lessathi in its claws. The lessathi, however, was expecting this to happen, so he waits for the manticore to reach down to his level, and then he impales it with both his scythes, causing the creature to tremble and scream for a few seconds, and then to fall silent, as it hits the ground, lifeless.<br/><br/>\"What the hell is he doing?\" the thug asks. \"What kind of enchantments could he possibly be using on those scythes to kill those monsters off so quickly?\"<br/><br/> The lessathi does not wait for the tramplers to begin their charge, and he chooses to engage them in close quarters, in order to limit their mobility. The desert marauders are now also joining the battle, and it looks as if they're aiming to surround him. To make matters worse, the manticore decides to join the fight as well, and it dives down towards the lessathi, closing off his last remaining escape route.<br/>\"Get out of there!\" Bruce shouts at him. \"Get out now!\"<br/><br/>The lessathi shows no sign of having heard Bruce. Instead, he waits for the last possible moment, when the marauders, the tramplers and the manticore are all within a few feet from his position, and he thrusts both his scythes fiercely into the ground. Almost immediately afterwards, we see a powerful electric shockwave cover the whole area around him, and the creatures that were about to attack him only a second ago, are now all dropping like flies, to the ground.<br/><br/>Electricity! So, that's what he was using! <br/><br/>The crowds are definitely not liking what they just saw. Several spectators have started booing loudly, and more of them are beginning to join the chorus, as the booing sound is slowly intensifying.<br/><br/>",

Let's go back.\"<br/><br/>As we all head back, we run into the owner of the arena, who was waiting for us at the entrance to our division's area.<br/><br/>\"May I have an explanation for all of this?\" the owner says, looking straight at the lessathi. \"Who told you that you could just come in here and interfere with this arena event?\"<br/><br/>\"You know very well who did,\" the lessathi says. \"And you'd do well to step aside, and let me pass, if you know what's good for you.\"<br/><br/>\"How did you manage to fool the magic detectors?\" the owner says.<br/><br/>\"Did you forget who provided you with those magical detectors in the first place?\" the lessathi says. \"I only had to make a few small tweaks prior to the event, in order to get those devices to ignore electricity.\"<br/><br/> \"You are not to interfere with this event any longer, do you understand?\" the owner says, furiously. \"I want you out of here, right this instant!\"<br/>\"Are you sure?\" the lessathi asks him, with a menacing tone.<br/><br/>\"Get out!\" the owner tells him.<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" the lessathi says. \"Then you will not be seeing me again.

Seeing her out in the open, the tramplers have also decided to target her, and they are now charging towards her. Neither of them are giving signs that they'll be stopping anytime soon.<br/><br/>Now, if what I've read in all my notes is correct, the tramplers are much easier to intimidate than one would suspect. Tramplers are not used to being challenged on their own turf, so if you keep running towards them at full speed while they are charging at you, they will eventually stop charging, and back down. Leila knows of this weakness, and that's the reason why she's not stopping. Hopefully, everything will turn out okay.<br/><br/>After a few more seconds of running at each other, the two tramplers finally stop, about a dozen feet away from her, and they begin to swing their spiked mace tails towards her, in an attempt to intimidate her. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch4_backup || 0) == 1) {%> Perfect! This is the best scenario that Leila could be hoping for. A trampler's strength lies in its charges. A few tail swipes are only good to scare off dumb beasts. They're not going to inconvenience her. <br/>Leila jumps over one of the beasts and lands on its back, stabbing it in the back of its neck. Before the trampler even has time to fall to the ground, Leila already jumps off its back, in order to attack its companion. The second trampler barely has any time to react, before Leila gets below its head, running one of her knives straight through its lower jaw and all the way to its brain.<br/><br/>As soon as she gets away from the dying creature, the last remaining manticore makes a very fast dive towards her, in an attempt to surprise her. Leila feigns ignorance until the very last moment, and then she makes a powerful slash at the creature's chest, exactly when it reaches her. The manticore drops to the ground, and Leila finishes it off with one swift strike of her dagger.<br/><br/>\"See?\" I say to Bruce. \"I told you we didn't have anything to worry about. Now let's hurry up and kill those cobras before she gets here!\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

I hope that this will not affect your enjoyment of the show too much. Now, with all this said and done, I would like to introduce to you the fifth division!\"<br/>Back to their regular stock, huh? I guess that those griffins and gargoyles that we killed in the underground caverns two days ago must have been their last reserves, then. It's a good thing that we decided to deal with them ahead of time, or that crazy arena owner might well have thrown those against us too.<br/><br/>When the next iron gate gets raised, Kate is the first one to step out into the fighting area. As she proceeds to the middle of the arena, the other members of her division also start to follow in her footsteps. Once I get a good look at all of Kate's teammates, I get the sudden realization that Kate is likely the most capable fighter in her division, even without her magic. Most of the others look severely out of shape, and some of them don't even have weapons. These clearly aren't the types of gladiators that came here willingly.<br/><br/> As the unarmed fighters go to get their weapons of choice from the walls of the arena, the new creatures are slowly beginning to walk out of their den. <br/>The first ones to come out are pair of cave lions, which are basically larger versions of regular lions, but without the mane. Next, we see a few black wolves join the stage, which look similar to the ones we fought in the ogre shaman's illusion, except they're only about twice the size of regular wolves. As these creatures begin to slowly advance towards the middle of the arena, a few more black wolves and cave lions are making their appearance from behind the big iron gate. <br/><br/>So this is what they call their regular stock. It's definitely a step down from the creatures we've been shown so far, but something tells me that the organizers wouldn't have been permitted to release so many of them at the same time if this were one of their regular shows. If Kate had a decent team backing her up, then I wouldn't be worried, but as it stands, she may well be forced to fight all these creatures alone. <br/><br/>The first group of lions and wolves decides to take the initiative, and they begin to run together, towards the gladiators. When Kate's teammates see the beasts charge towards them, some of them start screaming and running away as fast as they can, while others charge right back at the creatures, in a desperate attempt to intimidate them.<br/><br/>",

They might look almost human, but in reality, they couldn't be more different. They are just about as intelligent as the lowliest of reptiles, and they're twice as vicious.

They begin to walk slowly along the sides of the arena, trying to take measure of their opponents, and moving to surround them. <br/><br/>The last ones to come out of the den are the griffins. They are creatures that have the bodies, tails and legs of lions, while their heads, wings, and talons are those of eagles.

I knew I should have killed them in the underground caves, where they couldn't use their wings to fly away. This is definitely not going to be an easy fight for Kate, even if I did tell her all these monsters' weaknesses.<br/><br/>The sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves are the first to attack.

First, we'll go over there. If we're really doing this, then I'm going to need a weapon with long reach, before anything else.\"<br/><br/>To everyone's shock, the griffin obediently follows Hadrik's order, and it leads him all the way to the side of the arena, so that he can take a halberd off the wall. He then pulls on the griffin's mane, in order to show it the direction that he wants to go in, and the creature flies him all the way to one of the gargoyles, up in the sky. Hadrik cuts the head off the gargoyle's shoulders in one single movement of his halberd, and then he orders the griffin to move on to the next target. In the next few minutes, the dwarf travels from one monster to another, on the back of his trusty griffin, and he kills all of them in quick succession, without so much as breaking a sweat. <br/><br/>As the two of them finally descend to the ground, Hadrik sees that Kate had also taken care of the sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves on the ground in the meantime.

By special request of our esteemed arena owner, mister Venard, the first division to fight Velgos in the second round will be none other than division number four!

The fight will begin in the next few minutes.\"<br/>\"Humans!\" we hear the voice of Velgos the troll, shouting from the other end of the arena, as soon as the announcer stops talking. \"Your time is up! There is nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. All that awaits you is death. Blame your fate for having been unlucky enough to cross paths with Velgos the mercenary!\"<br/><br/>The crowds are going wild again, just like they did after Hadrik's first fight, and they're chanting the troll's name loudly over and over. <br/><br/>\"Velgos! Velgos! Velgos!\" they all keep chanting, as the troll waves to the crowd and makes intimidating gestures towards us, every once in a while.<br/><br/>\"Huh,\" I tell Leila. \"Well... damn.\"<br/><br/>",
