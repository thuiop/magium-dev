But, why enchanted weapons, specifically? Shouldn't the shield spell automatically defend you from most types of damage? What, are you cursed or something? And besides, why would it even matter? The shield spell is just a spell that they teach to beginner mages. Nobody really uses it in actual combat. It consumes too much energy, and it barely even absorbs enough damage to prevent you from dying, most of the time. The protections against specific types of damage should be much more effective. Not that I really bothered to learn any of those, what with my very durable giant skin and all.\"<br/><br/> \"White mages have advanced versions of the shield spell,\" Daren says. \"They are a lot more cost effective. And I'm not weak against enchanted weapons, specifically. I'm vulnerable against all types of physical damage. Remember that time when the captain from the ogre fort hit me with a club and threw me into a wall? I've tried many kinds of protection spells against physical damage, but none of them seem to work for me. The only one that kind of works is the shield spell, but it's barely even working against regular weapons, let alone enchanted ones. Enchanting my armor to be as durable as possible was the only way I found to give me some measure of protection against these types of attacks.\"<br/>\"Huh,\" Hadrik says. \"That's odd. Do you suppose it could have anything to do with the spirit from the magical plane that Arraka said you are linked with? Like, maybe the spirit is allergic to earth matter, or something?

Hey, Illuna, could you try putting me to sleep too, so we can see what happens?\"<br/><br/>Illuna sighs, and she approaches me, touching my arm with her right hand, just like she did with Daren. A few seconds later, I feel a strong dizziness, and everything around me is starting to get blurry.<br/><br/> \"Damn it!\" I say, as I feel the world spinning around me. \"I may as well be put to sleep for all the difference this would make in a fight. I can't even tell up from down anymore. What's happening right now? Am I still standing up?\"<br/>\"Nah,\" Hadrik says. \"You're sitting with your arse on the ground, while grabbing your head with both your hands.\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, I feel my mind become clear again, and as I raise my head, I see Illuna standing in front of me, with her hand on my forehead.<br/><br/>\"What did you do?\" I ask her.<br/><br/>\"I cast a spell to cure your dizziness,\" Illuna says, as she takes her hand off my forehead. \"I also have a 'protection from dizziness' spell that I can cast on you, if you want. Given your partial immunity to sleep spells, protection from dizziness should help you both against sleep spells and against spells that attempt to disorient you. There is also a downside, however. While you have this spell cast on yourself, you will be a lot more vulnerable to suggestion magic, since the clarity of your thoughts will make it easier for someone to magically insert ideas into your brain. If I cast the protection spell on you now, it should last you for a few weeks, but there would be no problem in recasting it every day or so, to be safe.\"<br/><br/>",

More like a side effect of whatever he's planning to do. Let's say, for example, that Eiden knows for a fact that he will be forced to fight Tyrath personally before the end of this tournament. If the dragon is to be believed, then such a fight would completely raze the continent, which would most likely erase all of Varathia's cities from the map.\"<br/><br/>\"Damn,\" Daren says. \"You might be right. With the dragon declaring war against all of the cities, and Eiden announcing his return as the 'Creator', I wouldn't be too surprised if the two leaders of the armies ended up clashing before the end of the tournament.\"<br/><br/> \"That's not all,\" I say. \"Eiden specifically told us that this calamity would only happen 'shortly' before the end of the tournament. This means that he is expecting the tournament to play a part in triggering this calamity, somehow.\"<br/>\"Maybe the dragon will be waiting for most of the tournament participants to die out, before he begins his attack?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"That's definitely possible,\" I say. \"I'm guessing that the cities of Varathia already have their own defenses against Tyrath's armies, and he's also got the animals to worry about. It would be a pretty bad idea for him to unleash his armies now, when there are mages wandering around the continent, capable of slaughtering hundreds of monsters without much effort.\"<br/><br/>",

The terms of their agreement are much too vague, and Eiden could very well change his mind at any moment.\"<br/><br/>\"I agree,\" Daren says. \"However, given the vague information we have about this so-called calamity, the only way we can be certain that it doesn't happen is by taking care of both Eiden and the dragon, and that is... definitely not going to be an easy task.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry,\" I say. \"I know what kind of tricks Eiden's using, now. I'm sure I'll have them all figured out in no time. I haven't been studying magic all my life for nothing!\"<br/><br/> \"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"Now there's something I would love to see: Eiden getting beaten by his own tricks.\"<br/>\"Let's not be too hasty,\" Daren says. \"Barry only figured out two of his tricks so far. I'm guessing Eiden would know hundreds of them after his long life as a stillwater. Anyway, I'd say we've talked enough about Eiden. Let's pick up our pace. We've spent quite a bit of time in that marketplace, so we'd better hurry up if we don't want to leave the king waiting.\"<br/><br/>It takes us about another hour to finally reach the front gate of the king's palace. The king's servant was waiting for us at the entrance, and as soon as we get within hearing range of him, he announces that Golmyck is currently waiting for us inside.

I will stamp the papers for you there.\"<br/><br/> He goes to pull the lever behind the throne, and the path towards his secret subterranean room opens up once more, just like the last time when we've visited the castle.<br/>\"Barry, as usual, the throne room is in your care until I return,\" Golmyck says.<br/><br/>\"Yes, your highness,\" the king's servant says.<br/><br/>\"Barry?\" Leila writes, looking very confused.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, that's what the king's servant is named,\" Hadrik says, while we go down the stairs towards the secret room. \"Isn't that hilarious?

We intend to rid the king of this problem.\"<br/><br/> \"You want to kill all the lessathi in this city?\" Leila writes, shocked. \"You can't! If you kill any one of them, the others will find out, and they will send back word to their main headquarters. You will become one of their main targets!\"<br/>\"I would be surprised if I weren't already one of the lessathi's main targets,\" Kate says. \"They should know very well who I am.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, the lessathi will not have the time to contact their main headquarters,\" Golmyck says, as we all turn towards him. \"When I accepted your help, it was because I already had an idea of how you could deal with this problem in a timely manner, without it affecting your tournament schedule. There would have been no use in requesting your aid if there wasn't a quick way to deal with all of the lessathi at the same time, before they get the chance to alert their allies.\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/> \"The lessathi will be holding a meeting in about two hours from now,\" Golmyck says, \"in a subterranean chamber situated not far from this castle. The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the political implications of the earl of Ollendor's murder, and how it will affect them and the city of Thilias in the coming weeks. At first, this gathering was supposed to be held after your trial and execution. However, as I suspected, Eiden's intervention forced them to postpone it until after the end of the arena fights. Since you all managed to survive, I am quite certain that they will have a lot to discuss, especially regarding the reaction that Ollendor will be having to this unexpected turn of events. The meeting is mandatory for all the four lessathi who reside in this city, so you will have the opportunity to attack them all at once, without fearing that any of them will find out what happened to their comrades, and go into hiding.\"<br/><br/>",

Luckily, none of them know that this room of mine also has a secret entrance to the tunnels, so they haven't bothered to post any guards at this particular entrance.\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on, hold on,\" Hadrik says. \"When you say Barry, you're talking about your servant, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, that's right, I meant my servant!\" Golmyck says. \"I keep forgetting that I need to specify.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, if it's your servant, then couldn't you have just asked him for the information directly?\" Hadrik says. \"Why would you go through the trouble of having him followed?\"<br/><br/> \"Oh,\" Golmyck says, smiling. \"It's because my servant is a traitor.

I'd much rather have him as a plant, than someone who would be smart enough to actually fool me. And this way, I get to find out useful information about the lessathi, such as the exact hour and location of their meeting today. It's very convenient. All I need to do is let slip some seemingly sensitive, but ultimately useless information to him every once in a while, to avoid suspicion, and I get to have my own spy in the lessathi organization, with minimal effort on my part.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Alright,\" I say. \"And you, Daren? Which protection are you using?\"<br/>\"The golden one,\" Daren says. \"The one that makes a spinning effect with sparkles when you cast it.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh...\" I say. \"Okay... So, you mean the advanced version from the standard white mage spellbook. And Hadrik, I assume that you are relying on your partial resistance that comes from being a giant in order to defend yourself from such spells?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" Hadrik says. \"But I got paralyzed completely, just like Kate and Daren, despite my resistance.\"<br/><br/>\"Uh-huh,\" I say. \"Well, do you guys know what these three defenses of yours have in common?\"<br/><br/>\"What?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Absolutely nothing,\" I say, as I close my notebook. \"Which means that Eiden was not using a loophole, this time around. In fact, I don't think he was using paralysis at all. He must have been using a completely different type of spell, which has the same effect. Remember that time when Kate's friend left us all unconscious on the ground? She didn't use a sleep spell to do it. She used electricity. I'm suspecting that Eiden used a similar method to temporarily paralyze you. Didn't you all feel a shock right before you fell to the ground? I'm pretty sure you must have also felt a few other electric shocks afterwards, which were meant to keep you paralyzed for a longer period of time.\"<br/><br/> \"Come to think of it, yeah!\" Daren says. \"I did feel some electric shocks. But they didn't feel much different from the feeling you get from a normal paralysis, so I didn't really notice the difference at the time. But does this mean that Eiden can use electricity as an element, like Kate's friend?\"<br/>\"I doubt it,\" I say. \"The spell that he used seemed to have certain rules and limitations, which would not have been the case if he could have used electricity freely, as an element. The electric spell that he used to paralyze you felt extremely similar to a spell that I had access to, back when I had my stat device powered up, so it's likely the same one. I don't remember every single detail about it, but it was one of those spells that you could only cast once a day, and I know for sure that one major drawback of the spell was the fact that the area of effect was extremely small. I mean, you could pretty much just roll over to the side, and the following electrical currents would not target you anymore. The only reason why it worked against you was because you three happened to be standing very close together, and because you didn't know what kind of spell you were up against. If you knew how it worked, then you could have just gotten out of the way at the exact moment before a new electrical current hit you, since the effect of the paralysis wears off a bit, right before each new shock.\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, I very much doubt that I could have done that,\" Daren says, \"since I was trying to break free of the spell's effect the whole time, and it didn't work.\"<br/>\"That's because the spell shocks you at faster intervals if it sees that you're trying to break free!\" I say. \"It doesn't work that way. You need to be relaxed, and to only try to escape at the very last second. Of course, you can't know how often it will shock you until you let yourself get shocked a few times, while counting the number of seconds for each interval. The intervals will not always be of the same length, but there will usually be a pattern that you can figure out. Once you're sure that you got the count right, you wait for the last moment, and only then you try to escape. Obviously, the easier way around this would be to use protection against electricity, but with the amount of energy it takes to keep that protection up and running, you'd have to be insane to use it at all times, on the off-chance that you'll get attacked by an electrical spell other than the standard ones.\"<br/><br/>",

And to make matters worse, there was also that idiot caretaker who used to treat her like she was an actual lessathi. Disgusting.\"<br/><br/>He then turns towards Leila, when he sees the expression in her eyes change.<br/><br/>\"Oh, I'm sorry, are you upset because I'm bad-mouthing your 'father'?\" the lessathi says. \"Well, you know what? Your stupid father deserved much worse than the fate that he got. Parasytes like him should be happy that they are even allowed to live as slaves. They have no place in our society. You may have freed him for now, but we'll get him back, don't worry. And when we do, we are going to give him the fate he truly deserves. The fate of a useless piece of trash.\"<br/><br/>As Leila's eyes fill with rage, she completely forgets about the signal, and she jumps on the lessathi in front of her, thrusting one of her knives directly into his heart. I quickly take advantage of this opportunity, and I also jump to my feet, making sure that I'm just out of the paralyzing spell's range and aiming my dagger at the throat of the lessathi that was closest to me. The soft-spoken lessathi was not looking at me, and my attack takes him completely by surprise. He tries to jump backwards, but it's too late, and I manage to slit his throat in one single movement.<br/><br/>",

He said that you should remember the still winter!\"<br/>\"What did you... just say?\" the scythes-wielding lessathi says, as he drops Leila's head, and he stares at me, with a mixture of shock and fear in his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Don't listen to him,\" the soft-spoken lessathi says. \"He's trying to goad you into doing something stupid.\"<br/><br/>\"So, you're saying that I should just shut up and let Eiden's lackey provoke me?!\" the scythes-wielding lessathi says, furious. \"Is that it?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm saying that you should be calm and rational about--\"<br/><br/>\"Now!\" I see Leila's message floating in front of my eyes, and I immediately jump to my feet, making sure that I'm just out of the paralyzing spell's range, with my dagger aimed at the throat of the lessathi in front of me.<br/><br/> The soft-spoken lessathi was not looking at me, and my attack takes him completely by surprise. He tries to jump backwards, but it's too late, and I manage to slit his throat in one single movement. At the exact same time, Leila also jumps at the scythes-wielding lessathi, and she twists a knife into his heart before he gets the time to react. <br/>A mere second later, before the other two lessathi even have the time to understand what is going on, Kate jumps backwards, getting out of the trap's range, and she extends her arm, pointing her palm towards one of the lessathi, who is wielding a trident-like weapon. An ice cone then shoots out of her palm and impales the lessathi right in the head. Daren, Hadrik and Flower are, however, still lying on the ground, paralyzed, which means that they must have messed up their timing.<br/><br/>",

Wait... Scream? Since when can Leila scream?<br/><br/>My question soon gets answered, as the Leila that was on the ground slowly fades into thin air, and she is replaced by the lessathi from before, who is clutching at his abdomen, trying desperately to stop the bleeding. At the same time, the lessathi that was in front of me turns into Leila, who is now staring at the screaming lessathi in front of her, with her dagger still in her hand.<br/><br/>An illusion? It was an illusion all along? How did I not figure this out sooner?<br/><br/>While I'm busy questioning myself, Kate wastes no time, and she finishes off the last remaining lessathi by sending an ice dagger flying into his head.

Do you think that they may have emptied out their headquarters before this meeting, as a precautionary measure, on the off-chance that they actually got defeated?\"<br/><br/>\"They may have done it way before that,\" I say. \"If they were already suspecting that the king's servant got followed here, they probably considered this location to be compromised, so they made sure to not leave anything of value in this place.\"<br/><br/>\"I guess you're right...\" Daren says. \"So, I suppose we should be getting back to the castle, then?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Kate says. \"I'm definitely not going to find out any information about Diane from this place.
