"Ah, I see that you've finally returned," the king of the underground says in an offhanded manner, when he sees us walk into the waiting room of the rebel base.

He is currently busy reading a report from one of his men while standing next to the base's entrance, and he's only paying minimal attention to us. Before I get to answer him, the king cuts me off with a question that takes me completely by surprise.

"Should I take it that you're done negotiating with the Overseer?" he says in a casual tone, while still not taking his eyes off the sheet of paper in his hands.

"What are you talking about?..." I say, trying to appear as calm as possible. "I thought the meeting with the Overseer was scheduled for tomorrow."

The king of the underground sighs, and he stops reading his report, so he can look me in the eye.

"Listen..." the king says, with a very tired expression on his face. "The situation is very dire at the moment, so I'm not really in the mood to play games with you and your group. I'm going to tell it to you straight. I've been suspecting that you would go see the Overseer behind my back ever since our very first meeting. That's why I made sure to have Breynan accompany you on your little trip. I wanted to have an insurance that your private negotiations would not result in any negative consequences for the people of this city."

 "Breynan," Kate says, with her eyebrows furrowed. "Did you--"
"I didn't lie to you, I swear!" Breynan tells Kate. "I haven't spoken a single word with the king about this!"

"You misunderstand me, Kate," the king says. "I did not order Breynan to do anything. He went with you of his own accord, and he was not acting as a spy on my behalf. What tipped me off, in fact, was your behavior towards me."

"My behavior?..." Kate says.

"Yes," the king says. "From our very first meeting, I could tell by the look in your eyes that you didn't trust me at all. This wouldn't have been a problem if the healer were your leader, but since he openly stated that you people generally like to take decisions as a group, my intuition told me that it would be highly unlikely for you to ever agree to work together with me and my men. That is why I told Breynan at the end of the meeting that he wouldn't be allowed to go talk to the Overseer. I knew very well that this would turn him against me, and that he would most likely end up joining you on your little quest if he saw you heading for the surface."

As I'm hearing the king's words, I suddenly remember that I noticed him taking a short glance towards Kate at the end of our first meeting with him, right before he told Breynan that he wouldn't be allowed to come with us to meet the Overseer. Did this guy seriously anticipate our actions before we even had a chance to make up our own minds about them?

 "What kind of a ridiculous plan was that?..." Melindra says. "You were willing to keep the person who knew the most about the Overseer out of the negotiations team simply based on a hunch? What would you have done if your guess turned out to be wrong, then? What if Daren would have convinced us to wait until tomorrow and to go with your men to see the Overseer?"
The king shrugs.

"In that case, I suppose I would have just told Breynan that I've changed my mind, and that I would allow him to meet the Overseer after all," the king of the underground says. "Besides, it wasn't just my initial hunch. Every one of your actions since then has done nothing but confirm my suspicions. You never let go of your backpacks even when we provided you with a room, and the ice mage has been openly announcing her distrust of me for almost the entire duration of our second meeting. By that time, I was almost certain that you would go meet the Overseer by yourselves, which is why I came up with the proposition to forge an alliance with you based on necessity and not on trust. An alliance where each of us would be free to backstab the other when it served their interests. You do remember that I said this to you, right?"

 "So, what you are saying is that it is now your turn to backstab us?" Illuna asks the king.
"Good heavens, no!" the king of the underground says. "I'm not planning to do anything to you. Breynan might not be all that loyal to me, but he is most certainly loyal to the people of Ollendor, so I couldn't possibly imagine him still being on friendly terms with you if you had tried to hurt our people in any way. Given that he's not saying anything, I'm going to assume that at the very least you're not working against the interests of our people. That is good enough for me. After all, your healer friend has been working tirelessly to save my men's lives in the quarantine zone ever since he came here, so it would be an insult to him if I were to treat any of you as my enemies."

"Does this mean that you're not going to ask us what we discussed with the Overseer?" Kate says.

"Obviously I'm still going to ask you that question," the king says. "But you are free to not answer me if that is your decision. So... are you going to tell me what were the results of your negotiations with the Overseer or not?"

"A price?..." the king of the underground says, and he spends a few moments thinking about my offer. "Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I can't say that I would be willing to spend a lot of money on this information. The way I see it, either you struck some secret deal with the Overseer, in which case you obviously aren't going to tell me about it, or your discussion was centered on viable ways to assassinate the king, which have likely become irrelevant now that the king has ordered a city-wide lockdown.

"Start with the ones at the bottom. Those should be easy enough for you to understand even without knowing the layout of the city by heart like I do.

We leave the king and Breynan behind, and we begin heading for the tunnel leading towards our sleeping quarters.

 "I'm just saying that if you had told me this from the very beginning, we wouldn't have wasted so much time with my aura training!" Daren tells Arraka, in a loud voice.
"I did tell you, you moron," Arraka says. "I've been telling you constantly since day one that what you needed to do was to untangle the flow of your aura with your mind. How is this such a difficult concept for you to grasp?"

"It's because your words sound like gibberish!" Daren says. "How was I supposed to know that what you really wanted me to do was to imagine myself untying them like actual knots? I thought that I had to change the direction of each flow individually! You just don't know how to explain things clearly!"

"Oh yeah?" Arraka says. "Then how come the goblin understood, smart-ass? I only had to tell him once, and he got it right away. What's your excuse for that?"

"I don't know, maybe you just understand each other better because you're both monsters!" Daren says.

"I'm an elf, you miserable cretin!" Arraka says. "I already told you this once before!"

"Should I take it that you're making progress with finding the cure for the people in the quarantine area?" Illuna says, when Daren and Arraka reach us.

 "So, what you are saying is that it is now your turn to backstab us?" Illuna asks the king.
"Good heavens, no!" the king of the underground says. "I'm not planning to do anything to you. Breynan might not be all that loyal to me, but he is most certainly loyal to the people of Ollendor, so I couldn't possibly imagine him still being on friendly terms with you if you had tried to hurt our people in any way. Given that he's not saying anything, I'm going to assume that at the very least you're not working against the interests of our people. That is good enough for me. After all, your healer friend has been working tirelessly to save my men's lives in the quarantine zone ever since he came here, so it would be an insult to him if I were to treat any of you as my enemies."

"Does this mean that you're not going to ask us what we discussed with the Overseer?" Kate says.

"Obviously I'm still going to ask you that question," the king says. "But you are free to not answer me if that is your decision. So... are you going to tell me what were the results of your negotiations with the Overseer or not?"

#if(v_ch11_saved_rose == 1) {
 "Yes," Arraka says. "But only because the goblin managed to explain to Daren what I wanted from him, in simple enough terms that even someone like him could understand. Now he pretty much figured out the cause of the disease, so all he needs to do is go get the right tools for the job."
"Easier said than done," Daren says. "The tools themselves likely won't be a problem to obtain, but from what Kelrim told me, the shops around here are running quite low on medicinal herbs. There aren't many towns willing to do trading with a rogue city like this, and the medicinal herbs that I'm looking for apparently don't typically grow in the area surrounding Ollendor. We're going to need to try out a lot of shops until we find the ointments that I need, which is going to be a little difficult, given that we're wanted criminals in this city. And if what I heard about the lockdown is true, I have to wonder if the shop-owners are even allowed to sell their merchandise anymore."

"Maybe you could ask Rose for help with the medicinal herbs," Kate says. "With a little luck, she may know of some good substitutes that are more commonly found in herbal shops, so that you won't need to visit so many different vendors."

"That's not a bad idea," Daren says. "I'll make sure to have a discussion with her about this later."

"If you're going to shop for medicinal herbs, then I'll join you too," Kelrim, the goblin says. "I visit these shops often to get my own supplies, so I have a good idea of where it would be more likely to find what we need."

 "Are you sure?..." Daren says. "From what I understood, the sickness progresses much slower for goblins, so you could still wait a week or two for the city-wide lockdown to be over until you go shopping for the herbs. There's no need to put your life in danger even more by going out there now."
"But what about all the people who would die in the meantime if you don't manage to get the herbs in time by yourself?" Kelrim says. "I can't allow any more innocent lives to be lost for no reason! As long as I'm still drawing breath, I will do anything in my power to help!"

The goblin's words about innocent lives being lost for no reason cut deeper than I thought they would. He probably didn't do it intentionally, but when he said that, it immediately reminded me of his goblin friends that we murdered without a second thought before we entered the city. The fact that he's not blaming us for his friends' deaths makes it even worse. A quick look at Daren and Kate tells me that they're both thinking the same thing. Realizing that there isn't really anything he could say to make things better about what we've done, Daren decides to respect the goblin's wishes and to offer his full support.

"In that case, you can be sure that I will have your back, Kelrim," Daren says, with a serious look in his eyes. "I promise that I won't let anything happen to you while we're on the surface."

"Thank you," Kelrim says. "For what it's worth, I will also try to make the best use of my healing abilities, if we get attacked."

"If that is what you want, I won't try to stop you," Daren says. "But when we're outside, make sure to stand behind me at all times. You never know who might try to ambush us."

"I will be careful," Kelrim says. "Thank you for your concern. For what it's worth, I will also try to make the best use of my healing abilities, if we get attacked."

 "I think we should start heading for our room in the sleeping quarters," I say. "I don't really like talking out here in the open. Hadrik said that he was coming towards us from that direction, so we should normally run into him on our way there."
"Alright," Daren says. "I'll see you again tomorrow, Kelrim."

"Goodbye!" Kelrim says, as the rest of us go into the tunnel.

"Petal-- I mean, Illuna!" Flower says. "Would you mind if I went to sleep for another hour or two? I'm still feeling a little tired..."

"It's not a problem," Illuna says.

"Okay," Flower says. "Wake me up if something else happens."

"Do you think she's still affected by... what we saw below the tower?" Leila writes to me.

"Well, that image is a little hard to get out of one's head," I say to her, in a low voice, so that Daren doesn't hear us. "But still, maybe she was just tired. Illuna did wake her up in the middle of her sleep, so I guess she could simply--oh hey, look! There's Hadrik!"

 "So, I heard you guys went on an adventure without telling us!" Hadrik says in a loud voice with his usual grin, as he is getting closer to us. "Trying to keep all the fun for yourselves, aye?"
"Fun isn't... exactly how I'd describe it, but we'll tell you more when we get to our room," I tell him. "There's too much commotion here with all of the refugees going up and down these corridors."

"Well, I just went to our room earlier and it's as quiet as ever," Hadrik says. "But I suppose that's to be expected, since they made sure to give us the most isolated room in the whole sleeping quarters. I don't think they really want us mingling with the locals."

"I think so too," Daren says. "But it serves our interests just fine, so we can't complain. Do we make a right here, or?..."

"Yeah, we take the first corridor on the right, then we just keep going for a while and take the third corridor on the left."

"Right," Daren says. "Lead the way, then."

Just as we are about to enter the next corridor, we see Albert, the assassin, who is currently busy guiding a group of refugees to their rooms. Our eyes meet for a fraction of a second but then Albert quickly looks away from me, pretending that he never saw me.

Albert looks at me rather suspiciously for a second, but then he gives me a hesitant nod, and he goes on his way, as the rest of us are now following Hadrik into the tunnel on the right.

When we finally reach our room, the first thing we do is to ask Daren to heal Illuna, because despite her remarkable skill at hiding it, she is still nowhere close to being fully recovered after getting stabbed in the back by the teleporting royal guard from the surface. We then tell Daren and Hadrik to sit down, because there is a lot to talk about.

Once we are done giving them all of the details about what was happening beneath the seredium tower, we can clearly see that each of them has taken the news in a different way. Daren has a determined but menacing look in his eyes, Hadrik is absolutely enraged, and Arraka couldn't be more unfazed.

"These bastards!" Hadrik shouts. "Do they have no honor whatsoever?! Where is this tower that they're holding the prisoners in? I'll go there myself and destroy that energy draining machine with my bare hands if I have to!"

"Then I'll beat up everyone in that tower until they tell me where the control room is!" Hadrik says. "Someone has to know where it is!"

"You're not going to beat up anyone, you buffoon," Arraka says. "You'll be lucky if you'll even get to land one punch before being sent right back to your own continent by the tournament spell that is protecting the locals."

"Argh!" Hadrik says. "Then I'll just dodge their attacks and punch through all of the walls in the tower until I find where I need to go! We have to do something! Why isn't anyone else as angry as I am about this? I don't get it!"

"Are you asking me this, or...?" Arraka says.

"Calm down, Hadrik," Daren says. "Believe me, I'm just as upset about this as you are. But we can't deal with this on our own. Even if we were to somehow free the people from below that one tower, there are still three other towers in this city, and I'm willing to bet that the same type of stuff is happening over there too.

"Who cares about the Overseer?" Hadrik says. "He's just a machine! The rebels are the ones that matter. Do we know if we can trust them? Maybe we can talk to them to assemble a rescue team or something."

"The rebels won't attack any of the towers," Kate says. "Not with their 'king of the underground' in charge. They already made it clear that they wouldn't be willing to expend resources on rescue missions even if it did turn out that innocent people were being held in the towers. The only thing we can hope to achieve by allying ourselves with them is to get help in killing the king from the surface. Nothing else."

"Here's an idea," Arraka says. "How about you stop looking for help from all these losers and actually start searching for ways to deal with your problems by yourselves.

 "Hey, Albert, what's the matter?" I say. "Are you stuck doing escort duty now? Is this really what the king of the underground's mightiest assassin has been reduced to?"
Albert does not answer me, but he gives me a really hateful look, and then he passes us by, as our group continues to follow Hadrik into the tunnel on the right.

"Wow, you and Albert really don't get along, huh?" Hadrik asks me.

"What can I say?" I answer him. "I guess I just don't do all that well with assassins."

When we finally reach our room, the first thing we do is to ask Daren to heal Illuna, because despite her remarkable skill at hiding it, she is still nowhere close to being fully recovered after getting stabbed in the back by the teleporting royal guard from the surface. We then tell Daren and Hadrik to sit down, because there is a lot to talk about.

Once we are done giving them all of the details about what was happening beneath the seredium tower, we can clearly see that each of them has taken the news in a different way. Daren has a determined but menacing look in his eyes, Hadrik is absolutely enraged, and Arraka couldn't be more unfazed.

"These bastards!" Hadrik shouts. "Do they have no honor whatsoever?! Where is this tower that they're holding the prisoners in? I'll go there myself and destroy that energy draining machine with my bare hands if I have to!"

When we finally reach our room, we tell Hadrik and Daren to sit down, because there is a lot to talk about. I also call Rose on her transceiver, so that she can hear what happened at the same time as the others.

Once we are done giving them all of the details about what was happening beneath the seredium tower, we can clearly see that each of them has taken the news in a different way.

 "We can't destroy the machine," Melindra says. "It needs to be deactivated from the control room. Have you not been paying attention?"
"Then I'll beat up everyone in that tower until they tell me where the control room is!" Hadrik says. "Someone has to know where it is!"

"You're not going to beat up anyone, you buffoon," Arraka says. "You'll be lucky if you'll even get to land one punch before being sent right back to your own continent by the tournament spell that is protecting the locals."

"Argh!" Hadrik says. "Then I'll just dodge their attacks and punch through all of the walls in the tower until I find where I need to go! We have to do something! Why isn't anyone else as angry as I am about this? I don't get it!"

"Are you asking me this, or...?" Arraka says.

"Calm down, Hadrik," Daren says. "Believe me, I'm just as upset about this as you are. But we can't deal with this on our own. Even if we were to somehow free the people from below that one tower, there are still three other towers in this city, and I'm willing to bet that the same type of stuff is happening over there too. If we just keep going from tower to tower, attacking everyone, eventually we're going to find ourselves fighting the whole army of Ollendor. We can't fight an entire kingdom by ourselves. The leadership of this city needs to change if we really want to free these people. And for this, we need allies. What did you guys think about the Overseer? Do you reckon he's going to be of any help to us?"

#if(v_b3_ch4_billy == 9) {

 "We HAVE been taking our training seriously!" Hadrik says, loudly. "We've been doing it every day since the rituals. What more do you want from us, you senile old hag?"
"I want you to take initiative!" Arraka says. "I want you to surpass your damn limits and go way beyond them. Don't just blindly follow my training programs like some brainless puppets. You're aiming to kill a GOD! How are you planning to do something like that if you can still be so easily defeated by two measly royal guards?"

"I don't understand why you care so much about this," Kate says, as she is leaning with her back against a wall, while crossing her arms and looking at the amulet. "You usually like to treat everything as a joke, but for some odd reason I never see you do that when you're talking about our training to kill the God of Time. Why is that?"

"Because this isn't a joke, damn it!" Arraka says. "Do you have any idea how many thousands of years I've waited to take my revenge on these self-proclaimed gods from the magical plane? After all this time, even if I were to kill them myself in the most painful ways I could think of, it still wouldn't be enough. But to have them killed by a circus troupe like you? That would be the cruelest and most humiliating death imaginable for a being made of pure magic that has reached that level of power. Ever since Barry-boy gave me that idea, I couldn't even think of a more fitting end for an arrogant sack of trash like Selkram. One way or the other, I'm going to make this happen, and you losers had better not stand in my way."

 "While it is reassuring that you're not doing things on a whim for once," Daren says, "would you by any chance also happen to have some concrete advice to give us? Or are you just going to keep hurling insults at us until we get better?"
"Oh, I'll give you some concrete advice, alright," Arraka says. "Hey, dwarf!  What the hell was up with that pathetic performance you showed us earlier today against that giant buddy of yours? All he had to do was say two words to you and he completely threw you off your game! Is that how much of a wuss you are? Are two meager words all it takes to turn you from a battle-hardened warrior into a clumsy tavern brawler? If I say those two words to you now, are you going to spend a whole day moping again? Well here, I'm going to say them! Dwarf village. Dwarf village. Dwarf village. Are you going to cry now, little giant?"

"Arraka," Daren says, with an angry look in his eyes. "If you say one more word, I'm going to--"

 "No, she's right," Hadrik says. "I should not have let him get to me like that with only a few words. If Barry hadn't managed to keep Gontrok busy while I was unconscious, he may well have killed you all, and it would have been my fault. I won't let it happen again."
"You'd better not," Arraka says. "Because if we ever get close to finishing off Selkram and you mess up because he triggers some repressed memory of yours by saying a few random words, I swear that I will put my fingers through your eye sockets and rip your skull from your spine. On that note, how about you work on your actual combat techniques too, and not just on your mental fortitude? I've seen you practicing some new moves in the last few days, but you didn't use a single one of them in today's fight. What were you waiting for? A formal invitation?"

 "I didn't know that you've been practicing techniques lately, Hadrik," Daren says. "If you wanted ideas for new moves, you could have asked me for some pointers."
"Well actually, it was your story about how you got your scar that made me want to start training again," Hadrik says. "Remember how I said that I found your story to be oddly inspiring? That was when I decided to take my weaknesses a little more seriously and to begin testing new techniques to overcome them. Unfortunately, I wasn't really ready to use them in battle just yet, and that's how that bastard Gontrok managed to catch me off-guard, but I'll make sure to perfect my new moves tonight. I'm not taking any more chances this time around."

"Good for you," Arraka says. "Now shut up. I'm not done giving 'concrete' advice yet. Hey, Kate! I'm going to ask you this very bluntly. What is it with you and freezing attacks? Do you have an allergy to them or something? I've barely seen you use them since I've met you, even though they are by far the strongest attacks in your arsenal when used against enemy mages. It's always icicles with you. Here's an idea. How about you diversify your attacks a little instead of being so predictable?"

 "I use icicles because they are the most efficient," Kate says. "They have the longest range and they pack the most power. They're also hard to detect because most enemies don't expect me to conjure them so high up above unless they've already seen me use this attack once before. Given that it usually works, I don't see any reason why I should use something else."
"Why are you trying to dodge the main question?" Arraka says. "What I asked you first was why you are specifically avoiding casting freezing spells. I've seen you do this even in situations where it would have been more advantageous for you to use an ice beam instead of an icicle attack. You can't give me your efficiency excuse in these cases, so what is the real reason, then?"

Kate frowns at Arraka's amulet for a few seconds, but she eventually decides to answer the question.

 "The reason is that I have far less control over freezing spells than I have over my icicle attacks," Kate says. "I can freeze people with my ice beams, but I can't unfreeze them. Once I shoot a beam, it is out of my control. It's different from when I conjure an icicle or make a dragon out of ice. The ice is something that I can control at will, and I can also make it disappear whenever I want. The same cannot be said about any of my freezing spells. There's also the fact that shooting icicles allows me to attack my targets with pinpoint accuracy, whereas most of my freezing spells affect a larger area, so if I were to hit someone by mistake, there would be no way for me to undo the effect. If I am to use a freezing attack, it's typically going to be only when I'm absolutely certain that I won't hit any of my allies with it by accident."
"Bla bla bla," Arraka says. "All I'm hearing is more whiney excuses. You don't know how to unfreeze people? Then learn how to do it. It's as simple as that."

"I've already tried doing it countless times," Kate says. "It doesn't work."

"Then try harder!" Arraka says. "Or ask someone, for crying out loud! You have two other elementalists in your team aside from you, and one of them happens to be an ethereal. Do you have any idea how many perks you get just from being an ethereal? This girl can learn in one day what it would take a normal mage years to master. Surely there is at least something she can tell you to get you on the right track. I think she's asleep right now, though, so we probably won't be able to confirm that until tomorrow."

 "Do you think that Flower's ethereal knowledge extends also to ice magic?"
"I doubt it, but that's not important," Arraka says. "All elementalists learn their spells the same way. It doesn't matter if they use fire, ice or whatever else. Even if Flower doesn't know anything about ice spells, she should still be able to give Kate some general pointers to help her out."

"So, if Kate learns how to properly control her freezing spells, will this also help her against the God of Time?" I say.

 "Not really," Arraka says. "But at least it will be a good first step towards teaching her to be a bit more versatile with her spells. She can't just keep relying on the same long distance attack over and over. Maybe Flower can give her some ideas of what new spells she could come up with. I've noticed that the little girl can be pretty resourceful when it comes to this sort of stuff. Alright, so now that we've got that settled, the next thing we need to talk about is the captain of the royal guards. This one's going to be a bit tricky. Ideally, I'd like to teach you all how to counter that guy's aura manipulation technique, but I don't think I have enough time for it. With the way things are going right now, I wouldn't be surprised if you guys had a rematch with him as soon as tomorrow, so we're going to need a more immediate solution to this problem. In other words, the next time when that old guy shows up, I want you all to leave him to Daren."
"Me?..." Daren says, surprised.

"Yes, you!" Arraka says. "You said you finally understood what it means to untangle the flow of an aura, didn't you? Well, the same concept applies when an enemy tries to envelop you in his own aura so that he can push you to the ground. You just untangle his aura, and then you will be able to move freely through it. Obviously, since you're dealing with an enemy trying to attack you and not with a bunch of sick people in an infirmary, it's going to be a lot harder for you to pull it off, but if you actually put that enchanted sword of yours to good use, you should be able to handle it. You do understand how you would be able to untangle an aura by using your sword, right?"

"Yeah..." Daren says. "Yeah, I think I do."

There is no answer coming from my transceiver. After waiting for a few more seconds, Arraka calls out to her again, this time in a louder voice.

"Hey, ROSE!" Arraka shouts. "Are you still there or not?"

There is some more silence for a while, and then we hear the sound of hurried footsteps getting gradually louder as Rose gets back to her transceiver.

"Sorry!" Rose says. "Suzie couldn't sleep, so I went to get her some snacks from the pantry. Did I miss something important?"

"No, but there was something that I wanted to ask about your time powers," Arraka says. "Did Barry tell you what you need to do before the next God of Time ritual?"

"Oh, uh, yes!" Rose says. "He said that I need to make sure that the God of Time won't be able to steal my powers again. I've been working on it, but... umm..."

"You don't know where to begin with your training?" Arraka says.

"No, it's not that," Rose says. "I think I know what I need to do, but it's really hard to tell if I'm doing it right without some sort of way to test my results..."

 "Is Flower really that talented? How did she not become insanely strong by now?"     
"She IS pretty strong by elementalist standards," Arrakka says. "You can't really compare her to the likes of that earth elementalist sage or Melindra, because those two have way more magical power than most normal mages. Besides, you can only go so far by relying solely on your natural talent. If you want to advance to the next level, you need to also be able to learn spells from books and the like, which is something that Flower is unfortunately completely incapable of. Anyway, that's not important right now. What currently matters is that Flower is an elementalist like Kate, so she should be able to give her some useful pointers to help her out."

"Right," I say. "So, if Kate learns how to properly control her freezing spells, will this also help her against the God of Time?"

 "Not really," Arraka says. "But at least it will be a good first step towards teaching her to be a bit more versatile with her spells. She can't just keep relying on the same long distance attack over and over. Maybe Flower can give her some ideas of what new spells she could come up with. I've noticed that the little girl can be pretty resourceful when it comes to this sort of stuff. Alright, so now that we've got that settled, the next thing we need to talk about is the captain of the royal guards. This one's going to be a bit tricky. Ideally, I'd like to teach you all how to counter that guy's aura manipulation technique, but I don't think I have enough time for it. With the way things are going right now, I wouldn't be surprised if you guys had a rematch with him as soon as tomorrow, so we're going to need a more immediate solution to this problem. In other words, the next time when that old guy shows up, I want you all to leave him to Daren."
"Me?..." Daren says, surprised.

"Yes, you!" Arraka says. "You said you finally understood what it means to untangle the flow of an aura, didn't you? Well, the same concept applies when an enemy tries to envelop you in his own aura so that he can push you to the ground. You just untangle his aura, and then you will be able to move freely through it. Obviously, since you're dealing with an enemy trying to attack you and not with a bunch of sick people in an infirmary, it's going to be a lot harder for you to pull it off, but if you actually put that enchanted sword of yours to good use, you should be able to handle it. You do understand how you would be able to untangle an aura by using your sword, right?"

"Yeah..." Daren says. "Yeah, I think I do."

There is no answer coming from my transceiver. After waiting for a few more seconds, Arraka calls out to her again, this time in a louder voice.

"Hey, ROSE!" Arraka shouts. "Are you still there or not?"

There is some more silence for a while, and then we hear the sound of hurried footsteps getting gradually louder as Rose gets back to her transceiver.

"Sorry!" Rose says. "Suzie couldn't sleep, so I went to get her some snacks from the pantry. Did I miss something important?"

"No, but there was something that I wanted to ask about your time powers," Arraka says. "Did Barry tell you what you need to do before the next God of Time ritual?"

"Oh, uh, yes!" Rose says. "He said that I need to make sure that the God of Time won't be able to steal my powers again. I've been working on it, but... umm..."

"You don't know where to begin with your training?" Arraka says.

"No, it's not that," Rose says. "I think I know what I need to do, but it's really hard to tell if I'm doing it right without some sort of way to test my results..."

 "Why don't you tell Kate how to unfreeze people if you're so smart?"
"Because I'm not an elementalist!" Arraka says. "It won't help her if I tell her how I control MY spells. Elementalists tend to do this sort of stuff instinctively, without thinking too much. She needs the insight of another elementalist that can explain these things in a way she can understand. Otherwise, it's just going to be me talking to a wall, like most of the time when I'm trying to teach Daren something."

 "The premonition came as a result of you having gained a better grasp over your time powers," Arraka says. "You're not going to be able to trigger these at will no matter how hard you try. Also, most of them should normally be about saving your own life, not somebody else's. I'm surprised that your first ever premonition was about saving Illuna. Or maybe it happened because you're the type who worries more about others than you worry about yourself? Hmm... Well, either way, you should definitely keep doing what you're doing. Hell, if you manage to keep up this pace, you might actually become more useful than all these losers combined. Even a so-called 'god' will have a hard time fighting when he's being constantly frozen in time. Which is pretty ironic for a self-proclaimed god of time, if you think about it."
"I... don't know if I would be able to constantly freeze him," Rose says. "Right now I can't even maintain the spell for more than thirty seconds without almost fainting."

"Yes, but when we'll be fighting Selkram, you'll be linked to the Magium, which means you'll have far more control," Arraka says. "And what you're doing now will definitely help during the ritual, so yeah, keep doing it. Just make sure to also do that other training we talked about."

"Alright, I will," Rose says. "Thank you for the advice."

"Okay, now we're really done for the day," Arraka says. "Class dismissed. Go get some sleep."

 "Don't worry about that," Arraka says. "As long as you feel like you know what you're doing, it is more than enough for the time being. Once you feel like you are a bit more confident in your abilities, I will give you a more reliable way to confirm your progress. However, the real test will come during the next ritual. I want you to be ready enough by then, because what I want you to do is to block Selkram's first attempt of stealing your time reversal power without him noticing. He will be confused for a while, but he'll never suspect you actually being able to fight back, so he'll think it was a fluke. Once you've made sure that your technique works properly, let him continue to steal your powers for the remainder of the ritual. There's no way we'll be ready to face him that soon, so we need to maintain the element of surprise until the third ritual. By then, hopefully the team will be in a slightly better shape."
"Is... that all you wanted to ask of me?" Rose says.

"No, there was also something else that I wanted to know from you directly," Arraka says. "I heard that you were able to see a premonition and that you even managed to freeze time long enough for these shmucks to get past a room full of traps. Does this mean that you can already slow down time? What about reversing it?"

 "Oh, no, I can't slow down or reverse time..." Rose says. "I only tried stopping time because this was the spell that I remembered being the least complicated to learn. I wouldn’t even dream of attempting to slow down time at my current level. As for time reversal... that is something that I couldn't do consciously even when I was linked to the Magium. I don't know how I managed to do it that time when you got out of the amulet. Oh, and the premonition just came to me without even having to do anything. I have no idea what triggered it."

 "Well..." Rose says. "I did finally manage to freeze time today after a lot of practice, but it was only for a little while, and I'm not sure how much control I have over it. Whenever I try to maintain full control over these powers, I get tired very easily and I feel like I'm close to fainting. I don't think I got to cast the spell more than three times, and at most I could hold it for thirty seconds."
"Thirty seconds?" Hadrik says, shocked. "That's amazing!"

"So you really can reliably cast a time-stopping spell," Arraka says, intrigued. "That is most definitely unexpected. Does this mean that you can already slow down time, then? What about reversing it?"

"Oh, no, I can't slow down or reverse time..." Rose says. "I only tried stopping time because this was the spell that I remembered being the least complicated to learn.

"I can still hear you, dwarf!" Arraka says from her amulet, which is currently being held by Daren. "I'm right next to you!"

"Heh," Hadrik says. "I know."

"Can I have the amulet back for the time being, or are you planning to return to the quarantine zone?" Illuna says, as she gets closer to Daren.

"No, I'm not going back there now," Daren says. "I need some rest. Here, you can have her."

He then hands Illuna back her amulet and she puts the chain around her neck.

"Just one question," Melindra says. "When you said that you'll be going shopping tomorrow, did you mean that you're planning to go by yourself?"

"Well, yes," Daren says. "I can't just force you to risk your lives out there because I took it upon myself to try and save these people. This is my responsibility."

"Oh, no you don't!" Melindra says. "If there's anything we learned today, it's that splitting up is a bad idea. There's no telling what can happen up there, especially now with this lockdown. If you're going, then we're going. Isn't that right, Kate?"

 "Yes..." Kate says. "You're right. We can't afford to make any more mistakes like this after what happened today."
"Exactly," Melindra says. "And besides, Illuna would probably kill us herself if she had to come rescue us a second time in less than twenty-four hours because of our negligence."

"That is correct," Illuna says.

"Okay, okay, you're coming with me," Daren says. "Everyone can come if they want. Now let's get some sleep, alright? Tomorrow we'll have another long day ahead of us."

"Illuna and I will take first shift!" I say, as all the others were preparing to make their beds.

"First shift?..." Daren says. "Barry, this isn't the wilderness anymore."

"Actually, I also think that we should be doing night shifts," Illuna says. "I don't trust these rebels very much, and the way they isolated us from the rest of the sleeping quarters is a little suspicious to me. You never know who they might send to assassinate us in the middle of the night if we're not careful."

 "In that case, I'll take the second shift," Kate says. "It's the least I could do to make up for all the trouble I caused everyone today."

"Hey, it's not like they can keep the lockdown forever," I say. "They'll need to go out and get food eventually, or they'll all die of starvation."

 "I'm back!" Rose says after a bit more time passes.
Right after Rose announces her return, Illuna conjures a sandwich out of thin air and she begins to munch on it casually.

"Wow, you really did make a sandwich..." I say.

"Yes, I figured that if we are to reenact our previous night shift together, we may as well do it properly," Illuna says.

"Right," I say. "So, umm... these plants that are growing on the cavern walls are really interesting, huh? I wonder how long they've been here."

"Dear gods," Illuna says. "You're not actually going to start the conversation the same way you did last time, are you? I was only joking about the reenactment. There's no need to match all of your previous lines perfectly."

"Hey, I didn't match them 'perfectly'!" I say. "Last time I asked you about the weather, remember?"

"Very droll," Illuna says. "Well, if the underground plants are your main topic of interest, I'm sure that Rose would be more than happy to have this conversation with you, considering that she's a herbalist. I look forward to listening to your discussion while I continue to eat this sandwich."

 "Umm, Barry, could you lower the volume and place the transceiver next to your ear for a second?" Rose says. "I want to ask you something in private."
"Sure," I say, as I do what Rose told me to do. "...It's all good. You can talk now."

"I remember you mentioning that Flower and Illuna aren't getting along so well right now," Rose says in a low voice. "Did you just volunteer to take the night shift with Illuna because you wanted to help them make up with each other?"

I take a quick look towards Illuna to see if she was able to hear anything of what Rose just said. Illuna doesn't seem to be reacting in any way, so I answer Rose calmly, in a way that I would normally answer any other question.

"Yeah, that's pretty much it," I say.

"I thought so!" Rose says. "Would you mind if I joined you too for a little while? I also wanted to talk to Illuna about this, but I think that things might work out better if we both talked to her together."

"Sure, you can join our night shift," I say, as Illuna suddenly turns her head towards me. "It'll be just like the good old days!"

"Perfect!" Rose says. "I'll be with you in a few minutes. I just need to go bring Suzie a tray of cookies and I'll be right back."

 "Should I take it that Rose is planning to keep us company for the night through the transceiver?" Illuna says, as soon as I take my transceiver away from my ear and raise the volume again.
"Yes, but I don't think she'll be with us for the whole duration of our shift," I say. "She will probably only join us a little in the beginning."

"Oh, good," Illuna says. "Then perhaps this time around I might actually get the opportunity to finish my sandwich."

"I wouldn't count on it!" I say, as we stop somewhere far enough from our room to not wake up our friends when we talk, but also close enough to be able to keep an eye on the entrance.

As we are seating ourselves on the floor, we see Melindra coming out of our room and heading towards us.

"Don't mind me!" Melindra says in a loud voice, as she approaches us. "I just wanted to go for a short walk through these tunnels before going to bed. I'll be out of your hair in a jiffy!"

She then walks past us and goes through a tunnel to the left, giving us one last wave before she disappears from our sight.

 "Look," I say. "Obviously Flower's brain hasn't matured past the age of nine, and we can all see from her behavior that she's still a child at heart, but what I was trying to say is that she can also be serious and dependable when it counts. You're definitely not going to see any of us treating her like an adult just because she decided to start imitating Kate's demeanor, but we could still make a compromise and let her call herself a twenty-nine year old if it means so much to her. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"Yes, there IS!" Illuna says. "We can't just let her live in an illusion because she can't bring herself to accept reality. This will only hurt her in the long run! The harsh truth is that no matter how much she wishes for it, she is never going to grow past the age of nine. She lost that chance the moment I invaded her body twenty years ago, and there is no way for me to undo the damage that has been done. The least I can do now is to help her come to terms with that fact, before she delves even further into her own delusions!"

"Hold on a minute, there..." I say. "Are you telling me that this is the real reason why you're doing this? Because you're feeling guilty?"  

"And what if I am?" Illuna says, as she frowns at me.

 "Actually, there was also something else that Barry and I wanted to talk to you about!" Rose says.
"Of course there was," Illuna says, as she takes another bite from her sandwich.  

 "Yeah," I say, "so the real reason why I volunteered us for this night shift was that I thought maybe we could continue our earlier discussion about you and Flower."

"Not this again..." Illuna says. "I thought we were done with that particular subject."

"Well, not exactly," I say. "We still haven't addressed the main issue. Your whole argument with Flower began because she wants you to treat her as an adult, but you refuse to do it. That is also why she's trying to act all mature now, and why she started calling you Illuna instead of Petal. It's because she's trying to get you to acknowledge her as a twenty-nine year old. Why do you care so much if she chooses to consider herself an adult? Why not just let her call herself whatever she wants?"

"It's because she's not an adult!" Illuna says. "And the rest of you don't consider her to be a grown-up either! You've all called her a nine year old before!"

 "Well yeah, but when we do it, it's mostly just teasing," I say. "On the other hand, you've known her for twenty years, and you're still having these sorts of discussions with her. Don't you think that you're taking this issue a little bit too seriously?"
"Let me get this straight," Illuna says, as she puts her half-eaten sandwich on her lap. "You are trying to tell me that you all consider Flower to be a full-fledged twenty-nine year old adult, and that I'm the only one in this group who still considers her to have the mental maturity of a child? Rose, do you also think that Flower should be treated like a grown-up?"

"Uhm..." Rose says. "I'll admit that it's a bit hard to talk to her as if she were an adult when she often acts in a similar way to my little siblings. But it also feels a bit mean to treat her like a child, given how important it is for her to be taken seriously."

 We keep walking until we get to a place far enough from our room to not wake up our friends when we talk, but also close enough to be able to keep an eye on the entrance.
As we are seating ourselves on the floor, we see Melindra coming out of our room and heading towards us.

"Don't mind me!" Melindra says in a loud voice, as she approaches us. "I just wanted to go for a short walk through these tunnels before going to bed. I'll be out of your hair in a jiffy!"

She then walks past us and goes through a tunnel to the left, giving us one last wave before she disappears from our sight.

"So, umm, it's been a while since we've been on a night shift together, hasn't it?" I tell Illuna, after a short period of silence.

"It has indeed," Illuna says.

"We should do this more often," I say. "It's moments like these that really strengthen the bonds of friendship between teammates, you know?"

"Are you planning to get to the point anytime soon, or should I go get a book to read while you continue to drone on about irrelevant matters?" Illuna says.

 "Okay, okay, I'll get to the point," I say. "The real reason why I volunteered us for this night shift was because I wanted to continue our earlier discussion about you and Flower."
"Not this again..." Illuna says. "I thought we were done with that topic."

"You really do have a way with words, don't you?" Illuna says, in a dry tone.

"Hey, what's done is done," I say. "You can't just let the past keep dragging you down for the rest of your life. It's been twenty years already. Don't you think it's time to move on?"

"Guilt or no guilt, I am still looking out for Flower's best interests," Illuna says. "There is no reason for me to 'move on'."

"I really think that you are selling Flower a bit short, here," I say. "Maybe she still acts like a child, but that doesn't make her completely oblivious. She's a smart kid. She probably knows very well what her situation is, but she chooses to stay positive about all of this and to make the most of what she has. Don't you think that it would make more sense to interpret her behavior like this, given her personality?

 Rose lets out a soft giggle.
"I almost forgot how much I missed Illuna and her usual grumpiness!" she says. "I really hope the two of them can resolve their argument soon."

"So do I," I say.

As we wait for Flower to wake up, I hear Suzie's voice coming from the transceiver, although she is too far away from Rose for me to be able to figure out exactly what she is saying.

"Okay, Suzie, I'll be right over!" Rose says. "Barry, I'm sorry. I know I said I'd join you during the whole night shift, but Suzie is having some real trouble sleeping, and she asked me to go read her a bedtime story. Is it okay with you if I leave for the night?"

"Sure," I say. "It's not a problem."

"Thanks!" Rose says. "Good luck with Flower!"

I then hear her footsteps as she heads towards Suzie's room, and a few seconds later she closes the transceiver. In the meantime, Flower is apparently still sleeping. 

 "If it helps," Rose says, "I also agree with what Barry said about Flower. She doesn't seem like the type of person who would delude herself into believing things that are not true. I think you might be worrying a little too much."
"That is a possibility," Illuna says. "I will not deny it."

"Great!" I say. "I'm glad to see that we're making some progress!"

"Does this mean that you've accomplished your goal for the night?" Illuna says. "Can we finally end this conversation?"

"Not quite yet!" I say. "You see, the thing is that I also wanted to talk to Flower about all of this, and since she said that she would only be sleeping for an hour or two, I figured that I would get a chance to speak with her before this night shift is over!"

"Well then, here's an idea," Illuna says. "I'm fairly certain that it's already been an hour or more since Flower went to sleep, so I'll just wake her up and leave you with her while I'll go get some well-deserved sleep. Have fun."

"Hey, wait!" I call out to her, as the blue light in her eyes fades away. "I was thinking that maybe all four of us could have a talk and-- damn it, you're not listening anymore, are you?"

 "Of course you couldn't," Melindra says, as she reaches us. "I was suppressing my aura completely, and it's already difficult enough to sense the aura of a stillwater as it is. You would have needed to have a magical sense that is at least as good as mine to be able to detect me."
"Okay, but what were you doing there?" I say. "I thought you went out for a walk."

"I didn't go out for a walk..." Melindra says. "I figured that something was off when you offered to take a night shift with Illuna out of nowhere, so I wanted to see what was up! I wasn't really planning to intervene, but you forced my hand when you began your endless stuttering session from earlier! What happened, anyway? Why is it that you can talk so directly with Illuna, but not with Flower?"

"Well, uh... how should I put it?" I say. "Illuna gives me the impression that even if I say something really stupid, she won't let it affect her emotionally. Flower, on the other hand comes off as much more fragile, so I'm not sure what is and what isn't okay to say to her in a situation like this."

"She'll be fine!" Melindra says. "You don't need to treat her like she's some baby! Here, let me show you how to start a conversation. Flower... What Barry was trying to say earlier was that he wanted to have a talk with you about your recent fight with Illuna."

"What?" Flower asks, shocked. "But I didn't have a fight with Illuna!"

 While Illuna is waking Flower up inside her mind, her body is left sitting on the floor with her legs crossed as before, except that the eyes are looking somewhere ahead of them, with a blank stare. When she finally takes control of her body, I can see that Flower has a very confused expression on her face, while her eyes are darting back and forth, looking as if she were trying to process a lot of information very quickly. I'm guessing that Illuna didn't exactly give her too many details before going to sleep, and it feels like she's trying to piece together a puzzle that is missing way too many pieces.
"Umm..." Flower says, as she turns to look at me. "Illuna said you wanted to talk to me?..."

"Yes, actually I wanted to talk to you about the--"

Instead of continuing my sentence, I stop suddenly, because I quickly realize that I haven't made any plans about how I was going to bring up this subject to Flower.

"About the..." I say again, but I can't seem to find the right words for this situation.

 How am I supposed to initiate this conversation? I don't talk a lot with Flower in general, so I have no idea how she'd react if I were to bring up a serious topic like this out of the blue. Should I start with a subject matter that is completely unrelated and then slowly steer the discussion in the right direction? Would she even be willing to discuss her personal issues openly with me, like Illuna? How will I be able to get her to make up with Illuna when I can't even think of a way to begin the discussion properly?
"About..." I say once more, but this time in a weak and hesitant tone.

"Barry, are you okay?..." Flower says, looking a bit worried. "Your face is starting to get all sweaty."

"Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine," I say, as I wipe off the sweat from my forehead with my sleeve. "I was, uh... I was just going to talk to you about the... the... the weather is really nice this time of year, isn't it?"

"Oh, for crying out loud!" I hear Melindra shouting from the tunnel that she went in earlier.

"Melindra?..." Flower asks, now looking even more confused than before.

"Melindra?!" I ask, shocked, as I watch her stepping out of the corridor and then storming in our direction. "Have you been standing there the whole time? I couldn't sense your presence at all!"

"Simply changing your behavior does not mean that you've suddenly matured, you know..." I say.

"Yes, it does!" Flower says, stubbornly. "I act more maturely now, so that means I'm a grown-up. End of discussion!"

"Flower, why do you want to be treated like an adult so badly?" Melindra says, as she looks at her curiously. "Why is this so important to you?"

"Because I am an adult!" Flower says. "What kind of adult wants to be treated like a child?"

"It doesn't mean that we're fighting if we're only having a slight disagreement!" Flower says. " 'Petal' was... just a childish nickname that I gave her shortly after I first met her. I've grown past that stage."

"Yes, I love them!" Flower says. "They're so beautiful!"

"And do you also like talking about my rock collection with me?" Melindra says.

"Of course!" Flower answers her.

As I hear them talking so passionately about the rocks, I try to lean closer to the stones on the ground, in order to get a better look at them. No matter how much I try to study them, however, I cannot find a single thing that would distinguish them from any random rock that you could pick up from a cave or from the bottom of a river.

 "Because Petal is always so serious and so dependable, and I'm just... me," Flower says. "I don't want to be a disappointment to her. Every time when we talk about my age, I feel like she gets more and more disappointed for some reason. I think that she's finally beginning to get tired of my childish behavior after these past twenty years. That's why I'm trying to change. I just don't want to let her down anymore."
"That's not why Illuna is looking disappointed when you talk about your age!" I say. "It's because--"

I suddenly realize that I'm not sure if Illuna's confession from earlier was meant to be a secret or not. Would she be upset at me if I told Flower that she felt guilty about the fact that the girl can no longer age because of her? Maybe it would be better if I avoided telling her that for now.

"Look," I tell Flower. "We had a conversation about this with Illuna a few hours ago, before we woke you up the first time in the tunnels below the seredium tower, and she specifically said that she has no problem with your childish demeanor, and also that she sees no reason for you to change. Not only that, but she even went as far as saying that you are perfectly fine the way you are. Melindra was there too. She can confirm it."

 "Well, you see, Flower, most people would consider these rocks to be nothing special," Melindra says. "Not only that, but they would also consider having a rock collection and talking about it to be a very childish thing to do."
She then turns towards me, just as I am leaning forward, examining the rocks on the floor.

"Isn't that right, Barry?" Melindra asks me, with a smile.

"Uh... kind of, yeah," I tell her, as I now turn to face Melindra. "I'm not going to lie. It's a bit of a weird hobby, to say the least. None of these rocks seem even remotely interesting to me."

"People consider rock collecting to be something childish?" Flower asks Melindra, shocked. "Then why do you keep doing it?"

"It's because I don't care what people think," Melindra says, as she gets closer to Flower. "It's my hobby, not theirs, and if they don't like it, they can think of me whatever they want."

"But... doesn't it affect you when they say that you're acting like a child?" Flower says.

 "Let me tell you a little secret," Melindra says. "An important part of being an adult is to no longer care if people call you a child or not. You are who you are, and that shouldn't change to fit other people's preconceived notions of what is and what isn't appropriate to do at your age. If people insist on considering a hobby like this childish, then let them. They're the ones missing out, not you."
"Yes, but..." Flower says in a more hesitant tone, but she does not continue her sentence and she falls silent for a few seconds, contemplating Melindra's words.

"You don't need to change who you are if you don't want to," Melindra tells Flower. "If you like the person that you already are, then stay that way. It's not worth making yourself feel miserable just to obtain some recognition from others."

"It's not about recognition, it's..." Flower says, and then she falls silent again for a few seconds.

"It's just that Petal is my best friend and...  I don't want to be a burden to her..." Flower says, as the look in her eyes is turning a little sad.

"Why do you think that you're being a burden to Illuna?" I ask her.

 "She really said that?" Flower asks Melindra with a hopeful look in her eyes, almost unable to contain her happiness.
"Those were her words," Melindra says.

"I... never thought she would ever say something like that about me," Flower says. "I was kind of thinking that she was beginning to regret getting stuck with me in the same body. It's just that she always seems so annoyed with everything I do..."

"Hey, Illuna is grumpy all the time," I say. "That doesn't mean that she hates you or anything. You should know that by now. And besides, she gets annoyed with everyone, not just you. For example, just before we woke you up, Rose and I were trying to get Illuna to open up to us a little, but do you know what she did? She took the first opportunity she had to walk out in the middle of our conversation and to go to sleep. Can you believe that?"  

"I suppose that would explain the half-eaten sandwich that I have in my lap," Flower says.

"Exactly," I say. "Anyway, so the point is that no matter how Illuna acts, we all know by now that she doesn't really mean it, and you should know that too. So there's no need to keep worrying about things like that, alright?"

 "Okay..." Flower says. "I'll try to stop worrying about it. But I'll need some time to decide what to do about... the way I've been acting lately. I'm still a little confused about what it is that I want right now."
"Hey, we're not in a hurry," I say. "Take your time. Sort everything out. Just don't forget to do some of Arraka's training too when you're not too tired. After all, the God of Time isn't going to defeat himself."

"I'm honestly surprised that Arraka hasn't said anything this whole time," Melindra says. "I would have expected her to be more than happy to share some of her 'wisdom' with us while we were talking with Flower about her problems."

"I think Arraka is sleeping at the moment," Flower says, as she takes the amulet in her hand so she can have a closer look at it. "You can sort of tell by the feel of her aura."

"Arraka sleeps?" Melindra says, looking genuinely shocked. "Since when? I don't think I've ever seen her sleeping before!"

"She does sleep from time to time, but she usually only needs a few hours a week or less to be well-rested," Flower says. "It's just another one of the perks she gained after she absorbed all those thousands of souls in the magical plane. You know, aside from her overwhelming magical power and her near-immortality."

"I... never thought she would ever say something like that about me," Flower says. "I was kind of thinking that she was beginning to regret getting stuck with me in the same body. It's just that she always seems so annoyed with everything I do..."

"Hey, Illuna is grumpy all the time," I say. "That doesn't mean that she hates you or anything. You should know that by now. And besides, she gets annoyed with everyone, not just you. For example, just a little earlier I was trying to talk to her about strengthening our bonds of friendship, and all she had to say to me was that I should hurry up and get to the point. Can you believe it?"

"That does sound like Petal," Flower says.

"Exactly," I say. "But no matter how Illuna acts, we all know by now that she doesn't really mean it, and you should know that too. So there's no need to keep worrying about things like that, alright?"

 "Okay..." Flower says. "I'll try to stop worrying about it. But I'll need some time to decide what to do about... the way I've been acting lately. I'm still a little confused about what it is that I want right now."
"Hey, we're not in a hurry," I say. "Take your time. Sort everything out. Just don't forget to do some of Arraka's training too when you're not too tired. After all, the God of Time isn't going to defeat himself."

"I'm honestly surprised that Arraka hasn't said anything this whole time," Melindra says. "I would have expected her to be more than happy to share some of her 'wisdom' with us while we were talking with Flower about her problems."

"I think Arraka is sleeping at the moment," Flower says, as she takes the amulet in her hand so she can have a closer look at it. "You can sort of tell by the feel of her aura."

"Arraka sleeps?" Melindra says, looking genuinely shocked. "Since when? I don't think I've ever seen her sleeping before!"

"She does sleep from time to time, but she usually only needs a few hours a week or less to be well-rested," Flower says. "It's just another one of the perks she gained after she absorbed all those thousands of souls in the magical plane. You know, aside from her overwhelming magical power and her near-immortality."

 "What do you mean by near-immortality?"
"I mean that even if you kill her, she won't stay dead," Flower says. "Most banshees will die for good if they are killed while they're possessing a human body, but that is not the case for Arraka. I think what she does is that she splits the damage between all the souls that she's absorbed, so even if the possessed body gets killed, she can just go into her spiritual form and jump into a new one. That's why Eiden and Eleya had to come up with that spell forbidding her to possess any hosts that are part of the civilized races, so that they could at least limit her powers."

"Any hosts except for you, because that spell no longer recognizes you as a human after your fusion with Illuna, right?" I say. 

"Right," Flower says.

"Wait," I say. "But what if Arraka tried to possess Tyrath, instead? Isn't he like... crazy strong? And he's a monster, so the restriction wouldn't work for him."

 "Him being strong does not mean that Arraka would gain any advantage by possessing him," Flower says. "What matters is how similar in nature the two souls are, not how powerful the host is. Even if Arraka were able to possess Tyrath, she probably wouldn't be able to gain more power than a regular mage when using his body. But I doubt that she would be able to possess him. Dragons are well known for being immune to mind-affecting spells, so I wouldn't be surprised if this would make them more resistant against being possessed as well. Also, the stronger someone is, the harder it would be to possess them or to absorb their soul, so I don't think that Arraka would have any chance to take control of Tyrath even if his guard were down."
"I see," I say.

"Hey, Flower," Melindra says. "Are you planning to do any training tonight?"

"I... think I'll pass for now!" Flower says. "I still feel a little tired after everything that happened yesterday..."

"Well, we still have a few hours to kill, so I guess we could play some cards for now," Melindra says. "And when we get bored of that, I could show you some more of my rocks! I actually got a few new ones while I was walking through these tunnels."

"Ugh..." I say. "Not the rocks again."

 "Oh?" Melindra says, with a smirk. "Do you still not appreciate the magnificence of my rock collection, Barry? Then I guess I have no choice. Flower and I will just have to spend the entirety of this night shift explaining to you in great detail what makes these rocks so unique. I'll teach you everything I know, until you will become an expert in rocks of all shapes and sizes!"
"You are far too kind," I tell Melindra. "But there is no need to spend so much effort just for my sake."

"Oh, but I insist!" Melindra says, as she begins to take some more rocks out of her backpack. "Flower, would you mind moving just a little to the right? I'm trying to align these rocks perfectly so that I can properly highlight the best traits for each of them!"

For the next three hours or so, Melindra and Flower made sure to give me a complete rundown of every single characteristic that they would consider to be valuable for each individual type of rock, and they also showed me how these traits could blend together to bring even more 'value' to what many may consider to be just ordinary stones.

Obviously, even at the end of the night shift my original opinion remained largely unchanged, but at the very least I could now say that I understood what made the difference between an ordinary rock and a collectable rock in their eyes, so their hobby would no longer seem as incomprehensible and illogical as before.

 "So, how do you wake her up if you need her while she's asleep? Do you spin her amulet?"
"Uhm... usually we just shake the amulet really hard until she starts shouting at us," Flower says. "But I suppose spinning would work too."

 "Does this mean that we can draw a fake moustache on her amulet and she won’t notice?"
"I've actually done that once!" Flower says. "As you can probably guess, she wasn't too happy about it."

"Is that so?" I say, as I take out a pencil from my backpack and begin drawing the moustache. "Let's see how she'll react this time, then!"

 "Hey, Flower," Melindra says. "Are you planning to do any training tonight?"
