"Our first objectives?" Hadrik asks. "Did I hear him right?"

"That's right, you heard me!" Golmyck, the gnome king says, as if he were responding to Hadrik's question. "I am now going to announce the objectives of the tournament's first round, so you'd better pay attention, because I'm not planning to repeat myself. Are you ready?"

Golmyck makes a short pause before he continues.

"Very well, then!" he says. "Your first objectives are as follows. You will need to each find a glowing pinecone and bring it to the city of Galamir. Glowing pinecones grow only on the continent of Varathia, so most of you may not know much about them, but they basically look just like regular pinecones, except they start glowing brightly when you take them in your hand. There is no time limit for completing these objectives, but the earlier you bring the pinecones to their destination, the quicker you can begin your next objectives, which will give you a head start, compared to the latecomers. Lastly, I would like to mention that in this round you will be allowed to form teams with other participants. A team can have as many members as you want, and if you all confirm that you are part of the same team when you reach Galamir, you will pass the first round together, as long as you have at least one pinecone with you. That would be all for now. Good luck!"

"What?!" Hadrik shouts. "He can't be serious! How can they even call this a mage tournament with objectives like that? What's next, are they going to tell us to go pick some flowers?"

 "Hadrik..." Daren says, with a very dark look on his face. "I honestly could not give less of a damn about the tournament's objectives right now."
"Oh, I almost forgot something very important!" Golmyck says. "Daren, the healer in armor, and all the members of his group are to present themselves at the gates of the royal castle of Thilias in exactly five hours. This includes the dwarf, the artificial mage, and the lessathi. Failure to do so will result in their disqualification from the tournament. The little girl that travels with them may also join them if she wishes, but she is not required to. Thank you all for listening! Have a nice day!"

The gnome then presses a button and the transmission gets interrupted, while the holographic screens in the air start to disappear slowly, one by one.

"Wait, how did he know that Barry was a lessathi?" Hadrik says. "Didn't Barry himself only find out about this recently?"

"The fact that the king of Thilias knew both about Barry's and Kate's true identities strongly suggests that he's been keeping an eye on us for a while," Illuna says. "He must have spies that inform him of everything that goes on in his kingdom. I wouldn't be too surprised if he knew about my existence as well."

 "Ah, crap," Hadrik says. "If that's the case, then maybe he also knows about me being a giant. Maybe they're calling me to the castle to kick me out of the tournament."
"They're summoning us because of what happened with the noble yesterday," Daren says. "They even have bounties on our heads. We shouldn't be too surprised that they'd want to interrogate us. Come on, let's head towards Rose's house. Going to the hospital now is out of the question without Rose to guide us, and it would be prudent to get our backpacks before we head towards the castle."

Daren pauses.

"One of us will also have to deliver the news of Rose's death to her siblings when we get there," he says.

"The hospital can wait," Rose says. "None of the injured are in critical condition, and you only have five hours to get to the castle. We still need to get back to my house so you can grab your backpacks, and getting to the castle from there will take you almost two hours by foot."

"Doesn't your city have some form of public transportation we could use to get there faster?" Daren asks.

"Like what?" Rose asks.

"Well, you know..." Daren says. "Like carriages? Pulled by horses?"

"Oh, gods, no!" Rose says, shocked. "Who would force a horse to pull a carriage? That would be even more horrible than animal hunting! Besides, the animals have left our city decades ago, when the hunts began. They are all living in the golden fox's domain now."

"Oh, right, right," Daren says. "The animals can talk here. I forgot. Alright, let's get going, then. As long as we keep a steady pace, we should be fine."

Daren gives me a long look for a few seconds. He doesn't appear to be very comfortable leaving this matter in my hands, but he doesn't seem to want to be the one to deal with it either, and neither does anyone else, by the looks of it.

"Alright," Daren says, finally. "Barry will be the one to give the news to the kids. Any objections?"

Everybody else stays silent, as Kate and Flower both look towards the ground.

 "Can I have Arraka back, please?" Flower asks Hadrik, as we start heading towards the mansion.
"Actually, I think I'd rather hold on to her a little longer, if you don't mind!" Hadrik says.

"Well, okay..." Flower says. "But make sure you keep an eye on her."

"Don't worry," Hadrik says, as he starts to spin the amulet again. "I'll be sure to give her all the attention she needs!"

We all follow Daren and go back the way we came, as we slowly begin to leave the slums behind us, and to enter the richer district that Rose's house is situated in.

Nobody said a single word while we walked down the alleys, not even Hadrik. Kate in particular seemed to be the most affected by what had happened, and the expression on her face was very painful to watch. Amidst the silence, an enraged Arraka would occasionally start showering us with a variety of insults and threats, as Hadrik ignored her and kept spinning her amulet despite her never-ending complaints.

 "Will you shut her up?" Daren says, after a while. "I've already had enough of Arraka to last me for a week. I don't need to hear her constant yammering the entire trip."
"Oh, right, sorry..." Hadrik says, as he closes the amulet and then continues to spin it by the chain.

Arraka's shouting is still audible, but it's more of a mild annoyance now that the noise has become muffled.

"I think my wrist is starting to go numb from all the spinning," Hadrik says, a few minutes later. "Barry, what do you say? Do you wanna give this a try? I assure you it's a very rewarding experience!"

 "Sure, why not?" I say, as I grab the amulet and start spinning it as well.
Arraka's muffled voice is becoming louder now, but I can't tell what she's trying to say. I'm probably better off not knowing, though.

"I've been thinking," Kate says, all of a sudden. "Could Rose perhaps not be completely dead? Could she still be somewhere in there, inside her body?"

"Kate..." Daren starts to say, but Kate continues to speak, this time raising her voice a little.

"Maybe there's still some way to bring her back!" she says, looking at each of us in turn, seeking our approval. "Maybe if we defeat that follower of Ulruk who stole her body, we can bring her back to normal. We can't know until we try!"

"Kate, please..." Daren says, as he stops and looks Kate straight in the eye. "Don't make me say this again. Rose is gone. You can't bring back the dead, no matter how hard you try."

"But how can you know for sure that she's dead?" Kate says, with desperation visible in her eyes. "You heard what she said before she left. You all heard her! She told us to take care of her siblings. Why would she say something like that if a part of Rose wasn't still in there, somewhere?"

"Revenants are born with the memories of their hosts," Illuna says. "Because of this, it is common for them to be confused at first, and to have a bit of an identity crisis, as they struggle to differentiate between their own thoughts, and the ones that they inherited from their hosts."

 "Then maybe we can still--" Kate starts to say, but Illuna cuts her off.
"Even if they may sometimes choose to uphold some of their old host's values and principles," Illuna says, "the revenants are still completely different entities than their bodies' previous owners. A revenant cannot be born if their host is still alive. The very fact that this revenant came to be is proof that Rose was already dead when the servant of Ulruk took hold of her body." 

"But..." Kate tries to argue again, this time with a lot more hesitation in her voice. "But... maybe if we..."

She stops when she realizes that she no longer has any valid arguments to bring to the table. Instead of continuing her train of thought, her gaze turns towards the ground again, and she doesn't say another word.

"I'm sorry," Daren says, as he turns back and he starts to walk towards Rose's house again.

We all follow him one by one, with Kate being the last to move from her spot. The rest of our journey towards the mansion was spent in complete silence.

Arraka's muffled voice is becoming louder now, but I can't tell what she's trying to say. I'm probably better off not knowing, though.

"So, what do you guys think about your first objectives?" Flower asks us, as we keep walking towards the mansion.

"I think that the guy who came up with them can shove them up his--" Hadrik starts to say but Daren interrupts him.

"Yes, we heard you the first time," he says. "What's done is done. I'm sure that you will not be the only one to have complaints about the questionable nature of these objectives. I for one am relieved that they didn't tell us to start killing each other or something. That would have increased the casualties dramatically."

"But how are you going to find the pinecones?" Flower asks. "I've been living here for years, and I don't even know what they look like!"

"Well, it's not like you've been looking for them specifically, either" I say. "Maybe there's someone in this town who could help us?"

"I don't know what to say," Rose says. "I'm pretty well-versed in herbology and these glowing pinecones never came up in any of the books I've read. They might have been discovered only recently."

"So you're saying that they most likely don't know where these pinecones are either, and they're just taking advantage of the situation to make us look for them in their place?" Hadrik asks.

 "Well, that's not exactly what I was saying, but--"
"Oh, I swear, when I get my hands on that king of Thilias, I'm going to smack him right across the room, guards or no guards!" Hadrik says.

"No, you're not," Kate says. "You still can't hurt any of the locals, remember?"

"Damn it, you're right!" Hadrik says. "But maybe it's not too late. Maybe Eiden will still give me the power if I ask him nicely."

The dwarf stops in the middle of the road and he starts shouting as loud as he can.

"Eiden!" he says. "Hey, Eiden, can you hear me?! I want the power too! Come on out, damn it, I know you're hiding somewhere around here!"

"Uh, Hadrik?" Rose says, smiling uncomfortably. "There are people living in these houses. Could you keep your voice down, just a little bit? Also, you shouldn't stop in the middle of the alleyway like that. You might have trouble finding your way back to my house if you lose sight of us."

 When we got closer to the mansion, Rose's siblings noticed us from afar and came running to greet us.
"Where's Rose?" Suzie says, after looking around for a few seconds. "Did she stay behind at the hospital?"

The others and I exchange uneasy looks, as Daren steps in front of us and places his hand on Suzie's shoulder.

"Suzie," he says, "there's something I need to tell you about Rose."

"Oh gods," Suzie says. "Is she..."

She stops for a second before she continues.

"Is she dead?" she asks.

Daren looks a bit shocked by the girl's direct question, but he decides that it's no use trying to beat around the bush anymore.

"Yes..." he says. "I'm sorry. It was my fault. I promised I'd protect her and I--"

"Oh, it's okay," Suzie says, forcing herself to smile. "Rose told us long ago that we should always be prepared for this to happen. She taught us how to cook our own food, and how to clean the house, and everything else we needed to know, in case she never came back from one of her journeys."

While Suzie talks, her brother is trying hard to hold back his tears.

 "We promised her that no matter what happened, we wouldn't cry," Suzie says. "We promised her that we'd stay strong and that..."
She stops talking for a second to rub her eyes with her sleeve.

"And that we would always remember her with a smile," Suzie says, with a much shakier voice than before. "And that we would keep living our lives and be happy, and... and..."

The girl can't contain her tears anymore and she suddenly breaks down crying. Her brother, who was also at his limit, starts to cry as well, in a much louder voice. 

"Hey, now," we hear a man's voice coming from behind us. "What kind of monsters would make such a beautiful girl cry like this?"

As we turn around, we see that the man who spoke is almost as tall as Daren, with a well-toned muscular build, wearing a shirt that was half unbuttoned, with long black hair that reached his shoulders, and a bristly moustache covering his whole upper lip. On his left hip, he is wearing a golden scabbard that appears to be holding a rather expensive sword, at least judging by the multitude of gems decorating its hilt. The man stops in front of Suzie, and he wipes her tears gently with his right hand.

"Did these mean people upset you, my dear Suzie?" the man asks her.

"Where's Rose?" Suzie says, after looking around for a few seconds. "Did she stay behind at the hospital?"

Everybody looks towards me, as I step forward and clear my throat nervously.

"What's wrong?" Suzie asks, starting to get concerned. "Did something happen to Rose?"

"Yes," I say. "We were attacked on our way to the hospital. We thought that Rose would be safe, but she..."

I pause, not knowing how exactly I should deliver the news to her without causing her a shock.

"Oh gods," Suzie says. "Is she..."

She stops for a second before she continues.

"Is she dead?" she asks.

Her direct question took me by surprise. Before I got the chance to answer, Daren stepped in front of me and he kneeled in front of Suzie, with his head bowed down.

 "Uncle Enrique," Suzie says, barely able to control her voice. "It's Rose. She..."
The girl struggles to get the words out of her mouth, as she is drowning in tears.

"She's dead, uncle," she says. "Rose is dead."

She then hugs her uncle as hard as she can, while she is still trying hard to contain her sobs.

"Rose is... dead?" Enrique says, with a mixture of both pain and shock in his voice.

His look then gradually darkens, as he looks towards us.

"Are they the ones responsible for this?" Enrique asks, as he starts to slowly pull his sword out of its scabbard.

"No!" Suzie shouts. "It wasn't them! They tried to protect her! They're her friends!"

"I am the one who let Rose die," Daren says, as he steps towards Enrique and bows his head before him. "I promised I would keep her safe, but I've failed her. I cannot even begin to express my apologies..."

After seeing the pained expression on Daren's face, Enrique slowly calms down, walks over to him, and then places a hand on his shoulder.

 "There's no need to apologize, my friend," Enrique says. "It is I who should apologize, for jumping to conclusions earlier. It's clear that you've suffered a great deal from this as well."
Enrique then walks past Daren, and he takes a good look at each of us in turn.

"Cheer up, my friends!" he says. "Why all the long faces? Rose would not have wanted to see you like this. She would have wanted you to smile. We should not be mourning Rose's loss. We should be celebrating your safe return. And as Rose's friends, you are all my friends as well!"

He turns towards Suzie.

"Suzie!" he says. "Bring me the finest bottle of wine from the cellar. The one that we were saving for a special occasion. You know which one I'm talking about, yes?"

"Yes, uncle," Suzie says, as she wipes her tears with her sleeve again, and she stops crying all of a sudden. "I'll bring it right away!"

"Now, then, friends of Rose," Enrique says, as Suzie goes rushing towards the house, "Before we toast, I would like to hear your names. It would be unfitting to not know the names of the people I intend to share a drink with!"

"What are you talking about?" Enrique says. "It is always a good time and place to have a drink! Drinking brings people closer together. Just ask your dwarf friend. Dwarves are renowned for their excessive drinking habits, and yet they are one of the most united people in the world."

"Aye," Hadrik says. "Although there is a common theory that the only reason why dwarves don't carry grudges is because they're always too drunk to remember what they did on the previous day. My name is Hadrik, by the way. Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

Hadrik then shakes Enrique's hand and he introduces the rest of us in turn.

"This here's Barry," Hadrik says. "This is Daren. Over there we have Kate, and the little girl's name is Flower. Oh, and we also have two banshees. The one inside the girl's body is named Illuna, and the one in the amulet I'm holding is named Arraka."

 There is a barely audible mumbling sound coming from the closed amulet, as Hadrik stops talking, but nobody pays it any mind.
"Two banshees?" Enrique asks, a bit shocked. "And Rose was friends with both of them?"

"Well, not both of them," Hadrik says. "The one in the amulet is more our prisoner than our ally, really, but Illuna and Rose were definitely very good friends."

"Well, in that case she will always be welcome here, banshee or no," Enrique says. "Ah, here comes our wine!"

 "Shouldn't we be discussing what we're going to do with the kids, first?"
"Ah, you need not worry about that!" Enrique says. "I have everything under control!"

"In what way?" I ask.

"I will give you more details as soon as our drinks arrive!" Enrique says. "Such important matters are best discussed over a glass of fine wine. I'm sure that your dwarven friend would agree with me on this as well!"

"Well, if you were to ask me, I would probably replace the 'fine wine' in your phrasing with 'dwarven ale'," Hadrik says, "but I guess we can both agree to it in a general sense, at least. My name's Hadrik, by the way. Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

Hadrik then shakes Enrique's hand and he introduces the rest of us in turn.

 "If we're going to have a drink, then why not go all in and have some dwarven ale?" I say. "We have some extra bottles of it stashed up in our backpacks."
"Ah, good old dwarven ale!" Enrique says. "It has been a while since I've enjoyed its taste. But I assure you, the wine that Suzie is about to bring will make dwarven ale seem like gnomish beer in comparison!"

"Now you've caught my interest!" Hadrik says. "After you went and said something like that, it's going to be real hard to meet my expectations. My name is Hadrik, by the way. Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

 Suzie was now hurrying towards us with a bottle of wine in her hands, while behind her, we could see Ella, who seemed to have fully recovered after last night, and who was carrying a plate that had several wine glasses on top of it.
When the two of them arrive, they place both the plate and the bottle on a picnic table next to us, and then Suzie starts to open the bottle.

"By the gods," Enrique says when he sees Ella. "My eyes have been truly blessed to bear witness to such beauty!"

He then bows gallantly and kisses her hand.

"If my heart didn't already belong to Rose for all eternity, I would have likely fallen for you in an instant!" Enrique says.

Ella is looking a bit confused after hearing Enrique's words, but instead of answering him, she decides to bow elegantly, and to introduce herself.

"My name is Ella," the girl says. "I've heard from Suzie what happened to miss Rose. I am sorry for your loss."

For a moment, there was a glimmer of sadness in Enrique's eyes, as he heard Ella's words, but he quickly forced back a cheerful smile on his face, before he spoke again.

"There is no reason for you to apologize, my dear!" Enrique says. "You had nothing to do with this."

 "I assume you are the new master of this house," Ella says. "I believe I owe you an explanation for my being here. You see, Rose has only just hired me yesterday to work as..."
Ella pauses for a few seconds before she continues, as she slowly lowers her head.

"As a slave," she says. "I am well trained in house cleaning and cooking, and I also know how to read and write. If you will have me, I promise that I will serve you as faithfully as I've served her."

"I'm going to stop you right there, Ella," Enrique says, as he gently lifts the girl's chin with his hand, so she can look directly in his eyes. "You should not be telling such lies. The Rose I knew would never have hired a slave to work for her. No matter what your past may have been, once you became a part of this family, you did so as a free woman, and not as a slave. As long as you work in this house, you are prohibited to call yourself a slave any longer. Are we clear?"

"Yes, sir," Ella says, smiling faintly, as tears start to form in her eyes.

"Very well, then!" Enrique says. 

He then turns to us.

"Well?" he asks. "What are you all waiting for? This wine isn't going to drink itself!"

 Suzie was now slowly approaching us, holding a wine bottle in her left hand, and a plate full of wine glasses in her right.
"I see you also brought glasses," Enrique says, as he goes to grab the plate from Suzie's hand. "Good girl!"

After they place both the plate and the bottle on a picnic table next to us, the girl starts to open the bottle, while Enrique turns to us.

"Well?" he asks. "What are you all waiting for? This wine isn't going to drink itself!"

"Uncle," Suzie's brother, Kevin, says, as he pulls on Enrique's sleeve, while he's still sniffing, with tears in his eyes. "Uncle, what are we going to do? How are we going to live without Rose? We've tried hard to learn how to live by ourselves. We've handled ourselves for weeks while Rose was on her journeys. We learned how to buy food, and how to cook, and how to use the fireplace, but we can't... we can't--"

"Do not worry, my young little friend," Enrique says, as he pats Kevin on his head. "You will not have to live by yourselves, because starting tomorrow, I will move back in with you!"

"You... you will?" Kevin asks.

"Of course I will!" Enrique says. "Would I lie to you? Once I bring back all of my belongings, I will be living here again, and it will be just like the good old times!"

Upon hearing Enrique's words, Suzie, who was busy filling the glasses with wine, comes running to her uncle and gives him a big hug again.

 "Thank you, uncle!" she says. "Thank you so much! I didn't think you'd ever come back!"
"I'm sorry to interrupt," Kate says. "But from what Rose told us, I understood that the reason you two got divorced was that you wanted to spend time with other women. Shouldn't you be discussing this with your current wife before making such promises?"

"Lover," Enrique says.

"I beg your pardon?" Kate says.

"Lover, not wife," Enrique says. "Rose has been and will always remain my only wife."

"Right," Kate says. "Your lover. What do you think her reaction will be to all of this? Can you be so sure that she will agree to move into this house with you, just to take care of your ex-wife's siblings?"

"Oh, she will be furious!" Enrique says. "She cannot stand children!"

 "Then how could you make such a promise in her name, without consulting her first?" Kate asks.
"Oh, I never made the promise in her name," Enrique says. "In fact, I intend to break up with her as soon as I get back home!"

"You're going to break up with your lover... just to move in with Rose's siblings?" Kate asks, somewhat shocked.

"Of course!" Enrique says. "Why are you so surprised? She will be missed, but in the end, she's just another woman who only loves me for my money and my good looks! I should have little trouble replacing her. There are plenty of other fish in the sea!"

He laughs.

"Now, then, grab your drinks, everyone," Enrique says. "Today, we toast for Rose: the most beautiful and kind-hearted woman I've ever known, and the love of my life. May she always be remembered, and may she continue to live in our hearts, from now and forever more!"

After hearing Enrique's speech, we all decided to take our wine glasses, and to join in on the toast. 

The next half of an hour was spent talking about Rose. We told Enrique of the adventures we've had with her for the past week, and he told us of their years together at the mansion. It was clear that none of us were in the mood for drinking, or telling stories, but it didn't matter. 

 Enrique was right. Rose would not have wanted us to spend our lives in regret. And we couldn't afford to avoid talking about her from now on just because it hurt to remember her. Rose did not deserve this.
While we talked, it was becoming more and more obvious that despite his cheerful act, Enrique was likely the one who was suffering the most from Rose's loss. However, whenever he talked about Rose, his smile would become genuine, and even Kate had managed to smile once or twice during our long conversation.

When time began to run out, we told Enrique that we needed to be heading towards the castle, and we each went to get our backpacks before starting on our new journey. As we were about to set out, Enrique took us aside for a moment to have a word with us, away from the kids.

"There is something that I did not dare to ask in front of the children," Enrique says. "I saw that you did not bring Rose's body with you when you returned to the mansion, so I assumed the worst, but I need to know. How did Rose die?"

 "This is going to be a bit hard to believe," I say.
"Oh, believe me, I am not a stranger to the world of magic," Enrique says. "I am prepared for anything."

"Well," I say, "what happened was that after Rose was killed, her body was... taken, by an entity that is called a revenant."

"When you say her body was taken..." Enrique starts to say, but Daren answers his question before he finishes it.

"He means that an evil spirit took hold of her body, after she died," Daren says.

"And I suppose that there is no way to bring Rose back, even if you kill this evil spirit?" Enrique asks.

"No, there isn't," Daren says. "I'm sorry."

"I understand," Enrique says. 

He pauses.

"If the children ever ask me what happened to Rose, I will tell them that her body was incinerated," Enrique says. "I would rather have them believe this than give them nightmares."

"Then we'll make sure to tell them the same story, if they ever ask us," Daren says.

"Thank you," Enrique says. 

He then turns to face all of us.

 "My friends, I am sorry that we did not have the chance to meet under better circumstances," he says. "Just know this: whether you decide to remain in the city or to leave before dusk, you will always be welcome here, whenever you decide to come back. May the gods be with you!"
"May they watch over us all," Daren says. "Goodbye, Enrique, and good luck!"

Once we all said our goodbyes to Enrique and to Rose's siblings, we went on our way, taking the shortest route we knew to the castle. According to Enrique, as long as we kept walking in the same general direction, we should be coming across a lot of signposts showing us the right way to our destination, so we shouldn't be too worried about getting lost.

"Do you think they'll be alright?" Kate asks me. "Rose's siblings, I mean. I'm not sure how much I can trust that man to care for them from now on..."

"Well, Rose definitely trusted him enough to leave him in charge of checking up on her siblings while she was gone," I say. "And his concern for the children looked genuine to me. Plus, the kids seemed to love him. I don't think we have anything to worry about!"

"I guess you might be right," Kate says. "He did seem serious when he said he'd break up with his lover to move in with them. Maybe I was just worrying over nothing."

 "Look, there's another one of those signposts," Hadrik says. "We're still on the right track!"
It took us a little less than two hours to reach the castle of Thilias from Rose's mansion. When we reached the front gates, Daren signaled the guards to let us through, and once they confirmed our identities, they opened the doors. We all step inside, slowly, as the gates slam shut behind us.

He then turns to face all of us.

 "I'm not sure if it was such a good idea to tell that lie to Enrique about Rose's death," Kate says, as we walk through the alleys. "He was her ex-husband. I think he deserved to know the truth."
"That man is not used to the world we live in, Kate," Daren says. "Even for us, it is hard to accept what happened, and we've all seen corpses walking in broad daylight many times before. But imagine what effect it would have had on someone who's lived his entire life within the safety of these walls. Telling Enrique the truth would have only served to give him nightmares for years to come."

"I... suppose you could be right," Kate says. "I have no way of knowing how this information would have affected him."

 When we got closer to the mansion, Rose's siblings noticed us from afar and came running to greet us. We left Rose to talk with her little brother and sister, while we each went to our own rooms to get our backpacks. When we got back to the yard, we noticed that there was now also another person standing next to Rose, besides her two siblings. 
As we got closer, we could see that this person was a man as tall as Daren, with a well-toned muscular build, wearing a shirt that was half unbuttoned, with long black hair that reached his shoulders, and a bristly moustache covering his whole upper lip. On his left hip, he was wearing a golden scabbard that appeared to be holding a rather expensive sword, at least judging by the multitude of gems decorating its hilt. The man seemed to be in the middle of a discussion with Rose, but when he saw us approach, he gave us all one long look before he started speaking again.

"Ah, I see you have befriended a few of the tournament's participants on your latest journey," the man tells Rose. "Could you please introduce me to your new friends?"

"Of course!" Rose says, and then she turns to us. "This is my ex-husband, Enrique. He was just telling me what Suzie and Kevin had been up to for these past few weeks, since he's been checking up on them every now and then while I've been away."

Rose now turns to Enrique, as she introduces us to him, one by one.

 "Enrique," she says, "these are my friends who have helped me get back home safely, and who have saved my life countless times in the past week. From right to left, we have Flower, Illuna, Kate, Barry, Daren and Hadrik."
"Wait, why did you tell me two names while you were pointing towards the little girl?" Enrique asks.

"Oh, uh, it's a little complicated," Rose says. "You see, Flower is the girl's name, and Illuna is a banshee that lives within her. They are both sharing the same body, but they are very good friends."

"A girl and a banshee, living peacefully in the same body?" Enrique says, surprised. "Now, that's something you don't see every day!"

He then goes to Daren and shakes his hand.

"You must be Rose's new lover!" Enrique tells Daren. "Take good care of her, my friend. She is an extraordinary woman!"

 "Uh, actually, I'm not--" Daren starts to say, but Rose interrupts him.
"Enrique," she says, as she squeezes her ex-husband's right arm tightly with both her hands. "Remember what happened the last time when you assumed that one of my guests was my lover?"

"Rose, you are being unfair!" Enrique says. "How was I supposed to know that the woman holding that man's arm was in fact his wife? They looked so much alike that I could have sworn she was his sister. Anyone could have made that mistake! And besides, this time I made sure that there was no woman standing beside him before I approached him, did I not?"

Rose sighs, as she releases Enrique's arm.

"Come on, Daren, let's go," she says. "We need to hurry to the castle. We wouldn't want to keep the king of Thilias waiting."

"Oh, right, the message from earlier!" Enrique says. "You mean that Golmyck was talking about your friends, when he made the invitation at the end?"

"Yes, exactly!" Rose says. "I'll need to lead them to the castle, so I'll be gone again for a few hours. Would you mind staying here with the children until I get back?"

"Of course not!" Enrique says. "That is the reason I came here, after all!"

 "Thank you, Enrique!" Rose says. "We'll talk more when I come back. Take care!"
"Farewell, my sweet Rose!" Enrique says. "And goodbye to you all. I hope we'll meet again someday, so you can tell me about your adventures over a glass of fine wine!"

We all say our goodbyes to Enrique and to Rose's siblings and then we begin our new journey, towards the castle of Thilias. Rose takes the lead, just like before, but this time she makes sure to show us all of the signposts and buildings she uses as landmarks, because later, we would need to find our way back to her mansion on our own.

"I'm sorry about earlier," Rose tells Daren, as we walk through the alleyways. "I hope Enrique didn't make you feel too uncomfortable. It's just that he's been worrying about me for a while because I haven't been with another man since we broke up, and he always gets carried away in situations like this."

"It's okay," Daren says. "Frankly, I'm more worried about that guy who got asked the same question when he came here with his wife. Did you eventually manage to clear the misunderstanding?"

"Uh, well, I tried my best to explain the situation to his wife, but I'm not sure how much she believed me," Rose says. "I know that the two of them are still together, but they haven't really talked to me since that day..."

"I don't blame her," Daren says. "I think even my wife would have been wary around you after hearing something like that."

He then quickly regains his composure and he comes to me.

"My apologies, friend," Enrique says, as he places a hand on my shoulder. "I didn't mean to offend you. I shouldn't have made assumptions based solely on appearances. If Rose has chosen you to be her lover, then I trust her judgment. I wish you both happiness in the years to come!"

"Okay, okay, you've given him your blessings!" Rose says, with her face completely red, as she grabs me by the arm and pulls me towards her. "Now Barry needs to hurry towards the castle. The king of Thilias is waiting."

"Yeah, I figured it was something like that," I say. "Don't worry about it!"

Rose smiles. She then looks behind us, to make sure that there is no one in hearing range, and she starts talking in a lower voice.

"And I'm also sorry that I left so early this morning without saying anything," Rose says. "It's just that I didn't want to make a big deal out of what happened. You saw how everyone reacted when Flower told them... And besides, we'll likely be going separate ways now that the first round of the tournament finally began. We can't even be sure that we'll meet each other again after you leave the city."

 "You're married?"
"Sort of..." Daren says. 

"How can you be sort of married?" I ask.

"I left Sophie behind in the remote village from the Southern Continent where we spent our childhood together," Daren says. "When I decided to journey around the world, in order to help the people in need, I wanted to get divorced, to keep her away from danger, but she would not hear of it. In the end, I offered her a compromise, giving her the freedom to spend her life with another man, if she wanted, even if we were technically still married."

"And did she do it?" Rose asks.

"No..." Daren says. "At first, I tried to push her away, convincing myself that it was for her own good, but no matter what I did, even if I went away for years on end without so much as sending her a letter, she would still wait patiently for my return. Luckily for us, all of the people from our village knew us very well, and they were kind enough to keep our relationship hidden from the rest of the world. Seeing that I couldn't convince Sophie to let go of me no matter what I did, I eventually gave up, and decided to work on improving the quality of our long-distance relationship instead. That's when I came up with the idea to enchant some magical transceivers in order to increase their range. The transceivers I have with me now have helped me keep in touch with her even when we were on different continents."

"Does that mean you can talk to her even now?" I say.

 "No," Daren says. "That's the first thing I've tried when I came here, but this continent is either out of range, or there's some kind of device that's blocking all forms of outside communication."
"Either way, maybe it's for the best that you couldn't contact her since you came here," Kate says. "I can't imagine how telling her what you went through this past week could have been any help in keeping her mind at ease. She's better off not knowing, to be honest."

"Yeah, maybe you're right," Daren says.

"Look, there's another signpost that shows the way to the castle," Rose says. "We'll be running into these a lot more often as we get closer to our destination. Follow me, we need to go into this alley, next!"

 "Wait a minute. I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that you were never married."
"Yes," Daren says. "That's because I spread a lot of false information, in order to protect her. I've made many enemies in my life, and most of them would not shy away from using my wife to get back at me. "

"So, where is she now?" Rose asks.

"I left Sophie behind in the remote village from the Southern Continent where we spent our childhood together," Daren says. "When I decided to journey around the world, in order to help the people in need, I wanted to get divorced, to keep her away from danger, but she would not hear of it. In the end, I offered her a compromise, giving her the freedom to spend her life with another man, if she wanted, even if we were technically still married."

"And did she do it?" Rose asks.

 "No..." Daren says. "At first, I tried to push her away, convincing myself that it was for her own good, but no matter what I did, even if I went away for years on end without so much as sending her a letter, she would still wait patiently for my return. Luckily for us, all of the people from our village knew us very well, and they were kind enough to keep our relationship hidden from the rest of the world. Seeing that I couldn't convince Sophie to let go of me no matter what I did, I eventually gave up, and decided to work on improving the quality of our long-distance relationship instead. That's when I came up with the idea to enchant some magical transceivers in order to increase their range. The transceivers I have with me now have helped me keep in touch with her even when we were on different continents."
"Does that mean you can talk to her even now?" I say.

"No," Daren says. "That's the first thing I've tried when I came here, but this continent is either out of range, or there's some kind of device that's blocking all forms of outside communication."

"Either way, maybe it's for the best that you couldn't contact her since you came here," Kate says. "I can't imagine how telling her what you went through this past week could have been any help in keeping her mind at ease. She's better off not knowing, to be honest."

 It took us about two hours to reach the castle of Thilias from Rose's mansion. Given that we arrived at our destination with plenty of time to spare, we took our time in saying our goodbyes to Rose.
"Okay, okay," Rose says, after Kate is done hugging her. "Enough with the goodbyes! You're only going to a meeting. It's not like we'll never see each other again!"

"Remember to keep that transceiver I gave you close to you at all times," Daren tells Rose. "If things get ugly, and we are unable to come back, we'll give you a call."

"There goes Daren again, with his usual optimism!" Rose says, smiling. "I'm sure you'll be fine. The king just wants to have a talk with you, that's all. Otherwise he would have sent an arrest warrant, not an invitation."

"Let's hope you are right," Daren says.

"Well, the entrance is that way," Rose says. "I think we've spent enough time standing around in front of the castle. Remember... While you're away, I'm planning to cook a meal that will put Flower's magic to shame, so don't be late!"

"Wouldn't miss it for the world!" I say.

Rose smiles, and she turns away, while we do the same, and start heading towards the big gate in front of us. As we approach the entrance, Daren signals the guards to let us through, and once they confirm our identities, they open the doors. We all step inside, slowly, as the gates slam shut behind us.

 "Hey, now, don't go writing me off before the tournament's even started!" I say. "There have been regular people who won contests against mages before, you know."
Rose giggles.

"Yes, and every single one of those was a drinking contest," she says. "You know what I meant, Barry... Even if you win the tournament, we're still part of two completely different worlds. Worlds that have been almost entirely isolated from each other for thousands of years."

"So what?" I say. "The winner of the tournament is granted the right to go in and out of Varathia at any time he pleases, remember? You just wait here. As soon as I win this tournament, I'll get my mage powers real quick, and then I'll come right back for you! It's a promise!"

Rose's face is slowly starting to turn red again, as she hears my words.

"Hey, Rose, are these the kinds of signposts we should be looking out for on our way back?" Hadrik says, as him and the others are getting closer to us.

He then stops, when he sees Rose's red face, and he shifts his gaze between the two of us several times before he continues to speak.

"Am I... interrupting something?" he asks.

"No, it's fine!" Rose says, trying to quickly regain her composure. "Yes, those are exactly the kinds of signs you should be looking for! We should be running into these more often, as we get closer to the castle. Come on, follow me. We need to go through this alleyway, next!"

ID: B2-Ch01a-Hallway
TEXT: 

 There's something odd about this castle. I noticed it even before we went inside. The castle's windows looked as if they were supposed to have precious gems encrusted on their frames, but the gems were all missing. It also seemed as if several decorations had been ripped off from the towers. 
The castle's interior looks even worse. The hallways are completely empty. There are no paintings on the walls, no carpets on the ground and no vases on the tables. The place looks more like a dungeon than a castle. There aren't even any guards patrolling the hallways. I'm almost starting to wonder if we didn't somehow end up in the wrong place.

"This feels like the ogre fort, all over again," Hadrik says, as he opens Arraka's amulet. "Hey, you! Arraka! Are you sensing any guards hiding invisibly around here? Answer me!"

Arraka makes no sound, acting as if she weren't hearing a word of what Hadrik is saying.

"Giving me the silent treatment, eh?" Hadrik says, with a grin.

Suddenly, Kate freezes the whole area around us, making it look as if we were inside some frozen palace from a fairy tale.

"The area is clear," Kate says. "There's no one surrounding us."

"Great," Daren says. "Now unfreeze the damn hallway before anyone sees--"

 Before Daren got to finish his sentence, a door in front of us opened slightly, and a man that appeared to be some kind of a servant from the castle stuck his head out of it.
"The king will--" the man starts to say, but he suddenly stops talking, due to the shock of seeing the whole hallway completely frozen. 

After a few seconds, the man starts talking again, choosing to act as if nothing had happened.

"The king will be notified of your arrival, shortly," the servant says. "Please wait in this hallway until it is time for your scheduled appointment."

He then closes the door without saying another word.

"Well, you heard the man!" Flower says. "We still have plenty of time left until the meeting. Let's go exploring!"

"What are you talking about?" Daren says. "He told us to wait here. And Kate still needs to unfreeze the hallway, before anyone else sees this!"

"I can't unfreeze it," Kate says. "It will melt on its own in a few hours."

"We don't have a few hours!" Daren says. "If the king sees this, he'll have our heads!"

"Relax!" Hadrik says. "What's the worst that could happen?"

 "Good gods, man!" Daren says, exasperated. "Isn't there anything that ever sets you off?"
All of a sudden, the whole area around us gets covered in flames, and all of the ice quickly melts into water, which then almost immediately evaporates into thin air. The flames then disappear as quickly as they appeared, leaving the hallway in the same state it was when we first came in.

"There," Flower says. "I took care of it. Now, does anyone want to go exploring?"

"Perfect!" Flower says. "Follow me!"

"Oh, come on!" Daren says. "What are we supposed to tell that servant guy if he comes back and asks for you?"

"Tell him we'll be right back," I say. "And then give me a call through the transceiver."

Daren shakes his head in disapproval, but he doesn't say anything else. I go catch up to Flower, who seems to have stopped in front of a wall, not far from our original position. After looking at the wall from different angles, the girl starts to knock on the bricks, one by one, as if she were looking for something.

"Is there anything special about this wall?" I ask her.

"Shush, I'm trying to listen!" Flower says, as she continues to knock on the bricks.

After a few more seconds, the girl finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she starts to pull one of the bricks out of the wall with both her hands. As she puts the brick down, I see that inside the hole left in the wall, there is a small wooden lever.

"Wow, you sure know your stuff, huh?" I tell Flower.

"Of course!" Flower says. "Petal and I have been through dozens of ruins with hidden passages before! It's sort of our hobby!"

 "Less of a hobby, and more of a tendency to get into mortal peril on a weekly basis," Illuna says, as the girl's eyes turn bright blue again.
"I got it!" Flower says, as she pulls the wooden lever.

As soon as she releases the lever, the bricks surrounding it start to get pushed inside the wall, making way for us to pass to the other side. We both go beyond the wall, and enter a small dark room that has a stone pedestal in the middle of it. Upon closer examination, it seems that there is some writing on the top of the pedestal, but it is too dark to make out what it says.

Flower makes a small orb of fire, which she sends floating above the pedestal, so I can read the writing on it. Now that I get a clear look at it, it appears that the text is written in the Common language.

"What does it say?" Flower asks.

"It says: 'Place your palm on this pedestal, if you like discovering secrets.' "

"Oh, I love discovering secrets!" Flower says, and she quickly places her palm on top of the stone pedestal.

#if(v_b2_ch1_puzzle2 == 0) {
 "No, I'd rather stay here."
"Suit yourself!" Flower says. "Well, if anyone wants to come, just follow me. Otherwise, I'll go by myself."

"Wait," Daren says. "What are we supposed to tell that servant guy if he asks for you?"

"Just tell him I'll be right back," Flower says. "It's not like the king had anything to discuss with me or anything. I'm not even in the tournament."

"Well, that's true, I guess..." Daren says, as Flower stops in front of a wall, and she starts examining it closely.

After a few seconds, the girl begins to knock on each of the bricks in front of her, one by one. 

"What do you think she's doing?" Daren asks me.

"She's probably looking for a secret passage, or something," I say.

Shortly after I stop talking, the girl takes out a brick from the wall, and then she puts her hand in the hole left by the missing brick. The bricks in front of her then suddenly start to get pushed inside the wall, making way for her to pass on the other side.

"Wow, she sure knows her stuff, huh?" I say, as the girl disappears behind the wall.

"Well, we did first meet her while she was doing morning exercises in some trap filled ruins," Hadrik says.

 Suddenly, a hole appears at the base of the pedestal, and two small objects get thrown out of it. As I reach to get them, the hole closes itself back up again. Getting a closer look at the two items, I see that one of them is a piece of a puzzle, while the other one is a small parchment. I hold the parchment in my hand, so that both Flower and I can see what's written on it.
As I read the text on the parchment, I notice that it's written in the Common language as well, and that it says: "Find all of the pieces of the puzzle, and I will share with you my greatest secret. I've left one of these in each of the buildings I've designed."

The parchment is then signed as simply: "This building's architect."

It would appear that this castle's architect is also the one who designed the ruins from the forest. I now have two of these puzzle pieces in my possession. I wonder how many of them are left.
   
"Hey, this sounds like fun!" Flower says. "I want one too!"

She puts her palm on the pedestal again, but this time, nothing happens.

"It doesn't let me get another one!" Flower says. "Barry, you try it!"

"Hey, Barry, can you hear me?" I hear Daren's voice, coming from the transceiver.

 "Yeah, I hear you," I say, as I grab the transceiver in my right hand.
Flower frowns at me, for ignoring her, and she takes my left hand herself, placing it on the pedestal. Just like before, the base of the pedestal opens up and throws out another puzzle piece and parchment. Flower takes both items and puts them in her pocket.

"The castle servant came back," Daren says. "He said the king will see us now. Hurry up and get back here, will you?"

"Yeah, we're on our way," I say. 

After we make our way out of the dark room behind the wall, Flower pulls on the lever again, and the bricks go back into their original position. She then grabs the brick off the ground, and carefully places it back into the wall.

"We wouldn't want anyone else to discover the secret before us, would we, Barry?" Flower says, with a smile.

"I suppose not," I say, as we start to head back to where everyone else was waiting for us.

"Well?" Daren says when we reach them. "Did you find what you were looking for?"

"Yep!" Flower says, with a cheerful smile.

"Spectacular," Daren says. "Now, let's get moving."

He then closes the doors, just like last time, without another word.

"Hey, wait a minute!" Hadrik says. "Since when have we become Daren's team? I thought we were running a democracy here!"

"It's a figure of speech," Kate says. "What do you expect them to call us, if they only know Daren's name?"

"Yeah, I'm not buying it," Hadrik says. "They already knew that you were an artificial mage, so it shouldn't have been that hard for them to learn our names. Not to mention that we already gave them our damn names when we signed up for this tournament!"

 We open the doors that the castle servant used earlier, and we enter a long, empty hallway that seems to lead directly to the throne room. Before opening the last set of doors, Daren looks at each of us in turn, to confirm that we are ready, and then we all step inside the throne room, one by one.
The throne room looks just as empty as every other part of the castle, except there is a long, narrow, red carpet leading to the throne on the opposite side of the chamber, where the king is currently sitting. Standing beside him we can see the servant from before, and on the other side, an old man that I do not recognize, but who appears to be rather important, at least judging by his expensive clothing. The gnome is now dressed in a more kingly manner than when he made his last appearance, having a golden crown on his head and a red mantle on his shoulders. When we arrive in front of him, he greets us courteously.

"Welcome, friends!" Golmyck says. "Please, make yourselves at home! I'm sorry for the lack of chairs, but I've been told repeatedly that it would not be fitting for ordinary people to be seated in the presence of a king."

"Skip the formalities, king of Thilias," the important-looking man says. "This isn't the time and place to observe proper etiquette."

"Now, now, ambassador," Golmyck says. "Proper etiquette is always important, lest we descend into barbarism."

 "You speak to me of barbarism, when the people standing before us are proven murderers?" the ambassador says. "I did not come here to hear your lectures. I came here in the name of the king of Ollendor, in order to make sure that the murderers of his majesty's brother are rightfully punished!"
"Murderers they may be," Golmyck says, "but they are also our esteemed guests, and I would like to at least hear their reasons, before deciding their punishment."

He then turns to us.

"What say you, brave warriors?" the gnome says. "What was your reason for killing the earl of Ollendor?"

"Your majesty," Daren interrupts us, as he places himself in front of me, and he bows before the king. "Please, allow me to explain what happened!"

"Psst!" I hear Arraka's voice coming from the amulet, as soon as Daren begins to speak. "Hey, you there! Weakling! Stat wielder guy. Half-lessathi. Come here!"

"Half... lessathi?" I ask her, as I get closer to Hadrik and the amulet. 

"Never mind that!" Arraka says, in a low voice. "We've got trouble. Eiden just teleported in the middle of the hallway, and he's hiding with that invisibility spell of his."

"Eiden?" I ask her. "Why would he choose to come now, of all times?"

"I don't know and I don't care," Arraka says. "I promised that I'd let you know when Eiden was near, and I've kept my word. Now will you tell this buffoon holding my amulet to stop spinning me with every opportunity he gets???"

"Uh, right..." I say. "I'll see what I can do about it."

While I was talking with Arraka, it seems that the discussion between the king and the ambassador had gotten a bit more heated.

 "You would defend this filth?!" the ambassador shouts loudly at the gnome king.
"I'm not defending anyone," Golmyck answers him, calmly. "I'm simply saying that before condemning them, they need to be offered a fair trial."

"These scum do not deserve a trial!" the ambassador shouts. "They deserve to be executed on the spot! Do you want war, king of Thilias? Need I remind you that I represent the king of Ollendor himself? I will not stand here to witness this mockery of a trial when we already have all the information we need to pass their sentence this very instant! You will have them killed right here and now, or there will be war! Do you hear me, Golmyck? War!!!"

"I'm afraid that I can't let you execute these people, ambassador," we hear Eiden's voice coming from behind us.

As we all turn around, Eiden starts to walk slowly towards the ambassador, and he stops right in front of him. The ambassador is now sweating all over, and it looks like he's barely able to maintain his composure.

"What's the matter, ambassador?" Eiden asks, with a smirk. "Aren't you going to bow before your Creator?"

"No, I've heard enough explaining!" the ambassador says. "Your majesty, it is becoming obvious that these riffraff are not worth wasting your time on. If you would just turn them over to my custody, like I asked before this meeting, I would make sure that justice is done, and you wouldn't need to concern yourself with this matter any longer."

"That will not do, ambassador," Golmyck says. "While it is true that the victim in this case was a citizen of Ollendor, the crime occurred in the city of Thilias, which falls under my jurisdiction. According to the treaty signed six hundred years ago by all of the kingdoms of Varathia, this means that I am the one that must pass judgment upon them, not the king of Ollendor."

"You would defend this filth?!" the ambassador shouts loudly at the gnome king.

"I'm not defending anyone," Golmyck answers him, calmly. "I'm simply saying that before condemning them, they need to be offered a fair trial."

After I turn around and see Eiden's face, my first reaction is to grab Arraka's amulet from Hadrik's hand.

"You!" I tell her. "You said that you'd let us know whenever Eiden would be hiding invisibly around us again!"

"Did I, now?" Arraka says. "I must admit that my memory's been a little fuzzy, lately. I wonder why... Oh, I know why! It must be because of all the SPINNING!"

Eiden looks at me, with his closed eyes and smiles. I only now realize that I might have been speaking a little too loudly. He chooses not to comment on our conversation, and he starts walking slowly towards the ambassador. When he stops in front of him, we can see that the ambassador is sweating all over, and that he's barely able to maintain his composure.

"What's the matter, ambassador?" Eiden asks, with a smirk. "Aren't you going to bow before your Creator?"

"Ah," Golmyck says. "I assume that you are talking about the slave girl he was with at the time. Tell me, young lessathi, are you aware of the laws in our city regarding slavery?"

"Your majesty," Daren interrupts us, as he places himself in front of me, and he bows before the king. "Please, allow me to explain what happened!"

"Psst!" I hear Arraka's voice coming from the amulet, as soon as Daren begins to speak. "Hey, you there! Weakling! Stat wielder guy. Half-lessathi. Come here!"

"Half... lessathi?" I ask her, as I get closer to Hadrik and the amulet. 

"Never mind that!" Arraka says, in a low voice. "We've got trouble. Eiden just teleported in the middle of the hallway, and he's hiding with that invisibility spell of his."

"Eiden?" I ask her. "Why would he choose to come now, of all times?"

"I don't know and I don't care," Arraka says. "I promised that I'd let you know when Eiden was near, and I've kept my word. Now will you tell this buffoon holding my amulet to stop spinning me with every opportunity he gets?!"

"Uh, right..." I say. "I'll see what I can do about it."

 While I was talking with Arraka, it seems that the discussion between the king and the ambassador had gotten a bit more heated.
"You would defend this filth?!" the ambassador shouts loudly at the gnome king.

"I'm not defending anyone," Golmyck answers him, calmly. "I'm simply saying that before condemning them, they need to be offered a fair trial."

"These scum do not deserve a trial!!!" the ambassador shouts. "They deserve to be executed on the spot! Do you want war, king of Thilias? Need I remind you that I represent the king of Ollendor himself? I will not stand here to witness this mockery of a trial when we already have all the information we need to pass their sentence this very instant! You will have them killed right here and now, or there will be war! Do you hear me, Golmyck? War!!!"

"I'm afraid that I can't let you execute these people, ambassador," we hear Eiden's voice coming from behind us.

"No, I've heard enough explaining!" the ambassador says. "Your majesty, it is becoming obvious that these riffraff are not worth wasting your time on. If you would just turn them over to my custody, like I asked before this meeting, I would make sure that justice is done, and you wouldn't need to concern yourself with this matter any longer."

"That will not do, ambassador," Golmyck says. "While it is true that the victim in this case was a citizen of Ollendor, the crime occurred in the city of Thilias, which falls under my jurisdiction.

 The whole room falls completely silent, as the ambassador tries hard to force a humble expression on his face, while he bows slowly before Eiden.
"As always, I am but your humble servant," the ambassador says, sounding as if he were experiencing great pain with every word he spoke. "It is an honor to have you in these halls, oh great Creator."

"What?!" Flower and Daren both shout at the same time.

"Wait a minute," Hadrik says. "Creator, as in, the founder of the civilization of Varathia? Is that the Creator we're talking about, here?"

"I'm surprised that you didn't know this by now," Eiden says, with a puzzled expression on his face. "Didn't Arraka tell you? She was there when it all began, after all."

There are a few moments of silence, during which we all turn our gaze towards Arraka's amulet.

"What, didn't I mention it?" Arraka says. "I guess it must have slipped my mind. Aha- AHAHAHAHAHA!"

"So, you are the Creator that I've been hearing so much about," Golmyck says, while stroking his chin. 

"I am indeed!" Eiden says. "And I must say that I am a big fan of your work. I heard that the first thing you did when you moved into the royal castle was to strip it of anything of value, sell everything, and then give the money to the poor. The nobility in all of Varathia had been in an uproar for months after the event. It was a most entertaining spectacle to see!"

 "I was always of the opinion that the royal castle belongs not to the royal family, but to the people," Golmyck says. "I only did what anyone else would have done in my place, if they had been chosen by the people to represent their interests."
"I think you might be holding too high of an opinion of the people under your rule, king of Thilias," Eiden says, with a polite smile.

"Creator," the ambassador says, as he finally musters up the courage to speak again. "I know that your word is law throughout the whole continent of Varathia, but I must insist--"

"The continent of Varathia..." Eiden interrupts him. "You people always called it that, didn't you? But the size of Varathia is nowhere near the size of any other continent in the world. If anything, it's more of an island, really. In fact, if I recall correctly, that is how I named this place after the still winter. The island of Varathia. The island of freedom. Why did people start calling this a continent, I wonder? Was it because you felt left out, when you discovered that there was a world outside of Varathia? Was it perhaps to satisfy your own egos, fooling yourselves into believing that you could compare with the civilizations from the other continents?" 

"Creator, please," the ambassador says. "I don't know what your affiliation is with these mages, but they have done us a great harm. A life has been lost that can never be replaced. It would be most tragic if the victim's killers were to be simply set free."

 "Oh?" Eiden says, with an evil smile. "And what if I told you that I was in fact the one who gave them the ability to hurt the people of Varathia?"
The ambassador is now sweating even harder than before, and he seems to be too afraid to give Eiden an answer. Seeing the expression on his face, Eiden starts to laugh.

"Do not worry, ambassador," he says. "I never suggested that they should be set free. However, I believe we can all agree that an execution would be a dull way for such powerful mages to meet their demise."

"What do you... have in mind, then?" the ambassador asks.

"The arenas, of course!" Eiden says. "Have them thrown in the arena, and if they somehow manage to survive until the end, then it will mean that the gods have seen fit to acquit them of their crimes. The rules of the arenas state that you may not use magic during fights, so they won't get any unfair advantage over any of the other gladiators. There are even magic detectors placed all around the fighting area, to make sure that there's no cheating."

"Yes, but," the ambassador says, "if they somehow manage to survive, the king of Ollendor will--"

"Are you trying to say that the fabled arenas of Varathia, the pride of your 'continent', are not enough to stop a mere handful of mages that can't even cast any spells?" Eiden says, with a wicked smile.

"Are you trying to say that the fabled arenas of Varathia, the pride of your 'continent', are not enough to stop a mere handful of mages that can't even cast any spells?" Eiden says, with a wicked smile.

"No..." the ambassador says. "No, of course not..."

 The ambassador stops for a few seconds, to clear his thoughts.
"Very well, then," he says, finally. "The criminals will face their sentence in the arena. But I will oversee the proceedings personally. I want to make sure that nothing goes wrong."

"Of course, ambassador," Golmyck says. "The arenas are yours, for the duration of these events."

The ambassador pauses again.

"Three days," he says. "In three days, I will arrange the greatest arena event in the whole history of Varathia. Until then, the criminals are to be locked in the cells beneath the arena of Thilias, along with the other gladiators."

"It is settled, then!" Eiden says. "I look forward to seeing what you will have in store for us, ambassador. I will be seeing you again on the day of the main event. Do not disappoint me."

With these last words, Eiden teleports out of the room, without a trace, as he always does.

"You criminals are coming with me," the ambassador says. "I don't want you roaming the streets and putting any more innocent lives in danger."

 "Actually, ambassador," Golmyck says, "I would like to have a word with them in private first, if you don't mind. I'll be sure to have one of my servants escort them to their cells shortly afterwards."
"Hmph," the ambassador says. "Do what you will. I'm not planning to waste any more time here. I've got business to attend to. Just make sure that they're all in their cells by midnight."

The ambassador then walks away from us and out of the room, slamming the door shut behind him on his way out.

"Alright, then," Golmyck says, as he gets up from his throne. "Follow me. I'd rather not have our discussion in this dull place. I am now going to lead you to my real castle, where we can talk to our heart's content, until it is time to lead you to the arena."

 "What makes you think that we'll simply agree to be led to the arena?"
"Well, you are free to resist arrest, of course," Golmyck says. "But that would also result in your immediate disqualification from the tournament. Is this what you want?"

I open my mouth to say something, but I can't think of any clever retort to give him. Instead, I choose to remain silent.

"Of course it isn't," Golmyck says, answering his own question. "I do not know what any of your reasons or motivations for coming here might have been, but I would imagine that if they were strong enough to make you want to risk your lives in a tournament like this, then you would definitely not let such a minor obstacle stand in your way. If it helps, then you can consider this arena as an extra qualification round, of sorts. To get you warmed up for the main event. Now, where was that hidden lever, again?... Ah, yes, here it is!"

The gnome reaches behind the throne with his right hand, and he pulls on a lever. This causes one of the stone blocks forming the floor in front of us to move aside by itself, revealing a hidden staircase that leads to the lower levels of the castle.

"Barry, I leave the throne room in your care until I return," Golmyck says.

 "What?..." I say.
"Yes, your highness," the king's servant says, almost at the same time as me.

"Oh, my apologies," Golmyck says, after he realizes the confusion he's created. "I was talking to my servant. He is also named Barry."

He then turns to face all of us.

"Alright, this way, if you please!" Golmyck says, as he starts to go down the stairs.
 
The rest of us exchange a few looks, and then we follow the gnome, until we reach an underground room filled with machine parts and prototypes, as well as various tools that seem to have been thrown around randomly after their use. In the middle of the room, there is a workbench on top of which we can see a large device that looks like a bigger version of Daren's transmitters, with a green light at the bottom. 

When we entered the room, Golmyck was in the process of taking off his mantle and crown, and putting on the oil stained lab coat that we saw him wear earlier, when he appeared on the hologram. Now that I look around more closely, I realize that this is in fact the exact room that he was transmitting from, and that the device on the workbench is likely the one that he'd finished fixing, right before the transmission.

 "So, what exactly are these events that we need to win in order be set free, then?"
"The only thing I can say for sure is that it's going to be a series of battles involving other gladiators and possibly some monsters," Golmyck says. "Other than that it could be anyone's guess. The rules tend to change from one event to another, and they depend heavily on the whims of the organizers. Since the ambassador is the one in charge of organization this time around, my guess is that the rules will be made in a way that puts you at the greatest disadvantage.

 "Welcome to my castle inside my castle," Golmyck says. "I found this secret room shortly after moving in here, and I quickly decided to take advantage of the large unused space in order to set up my new workshop. I haven't really been tinkering with devices as often as I would have liked since I became king, but I find that this place always relaxes me after a heated discussion such as the one that I had with the ambassador earlier."
"You said that you had something you wanted to discuss with us in private?" Daren says.

"Yes, I did," Golmyck says. "Let's start with your giant friend over there, who is currently shapeshifting into a dwarf."

"Damn it!" Hadrik says. "I should have known that it was all too good to be true. Is this the part where you kick me out of the tournament?"

"Of course not!" Golmyck says. "The rules of the tournament never explicitly stated that giants were not allowed in the tournament. We only avoided inviting giants to this contest because of the overwhelming advantage you would get from both your size and your strength. However, given that you have willingly shrunk yourself to the size of a dwarf, we have decided to make an exception in your case. You will be permitted to participate in this tournament, as long as you do not shapeshift yourself into anything bigger than what would normally be possible for a dwarf. And also, since you seem to be so fond of your dwarf form, this is how you will present yourself to all other participants from now on. I don't want any of the other mages finding out that you are in fact a giant. Are we clear?"

 "As clear as can be!" Hadrik says, grinning happily. 
"Well, in that case, you are free to go!" Golmyck says. "I no longer have any business to discuss with you."

"You mean I'm free to go to the arena, or..."

"No, I mean that you are free to carry on with the first round of the tournament," Golmyck says. "Unlike your friends, you were not present at the scene of the crime, so there is no reason for us to incarcerate you. There is no need for you to go into the arena."

"The hell there isn't!" Hadrik shouts. "Do you think I came all the way here to go looking for pinecones? I came here to fight, damn it! I swear, if you don't let me fight in this arena, I'm going to start thrashing the whole neighborhood until your guards throw me in there themselves!"

 "Well, if you insist, then I can write a letter of admission for you, which you can give to the guards at the arena's entrance," Golmyck says. "They'll be sure to let you in once they see the royal seal."
"Perfect!" Hadrik says. "Much obliged!"

"Should I also be writing a letter for the girl and the banshee over there?" Golmyck says, as he looks towards Flower.

"Uh, well--" Flower starts to say, but Illuna interrupts her.

"No, we're fine," she says, as the girl's eyes turn blue. "We'll watch the show from the spectator seats."

"Very well," Golmyck says. "Then I'll be sure to provide you with a ticket."

"I see you've done your homework," Hadrik says. "I didn't think you'd also know about Illuna."

"My spies have been instructed to be extra vigilant when it comes to mages from other continents," Golmyck says. "They've been keeping a close eye on you ever since you entered the city." 

"Does this mean that they were also watching us when we attacked the noble?" Daren says.

 "Yes..." Golmyck says. "This is the second reason why I wanted to speak to you in private. First of all, I would like to offer you an apology. I imagine that the scene you witnessed that day must have been quite shocking for outsiders like yourselves."
"You don't sound like you approve of what was happening with the slave girl," Kate says. 

"I do not," Golmyck says. "I personally find that the way our society treats slaves is sickening, and that we are all responsible in a way for allowing this system to continue. I, myself, am not much better than my predecessors, because I've barely done anything conclusive to address the problem since I moved into this castle."

"But why?" Daren asks. "Why haven't you done anything? You are the king. You could do so much to help these people..."

 "Look up there," Golmyck says, as he points towards a metal device hanging from the ceiling.
"What about it?" Daren asks, after he gives the device a cursory glance.

"What you see over there is an invention of my own making, with the sole purpose of blocking communication towards the outside," Golmyck says. "I installed it here shortly after my arrival to the castle."

"You're saying that someone could be trying to listen to our conversation?" I say.

"Oh, they are most certainly trying!" Golmyck says. "You might not have noticed, but the room above us is littered with dozens of hidden devices, made for spying on conversations. Make no mistake, I am not the only person with an information network in this city. And the control I have over my kingdom is in fact a lot more limited than you might think."

"And who are these people that are keeping tabs on you, exactly?" Hadrik asks. "The other kings?"

"Yes, in a way," Golmyck says. "The ones in charge of keeping an eye on me are a group of lessathi who are allies with the other kings, but who work independently. They control a vast underground network of spies and assassins who rival my own, and their purpose is to make sure that I don't take too many initiatives that might 'endanger' the future of Varathia. If I try to take a decision as bold as freeing all of the slaves in my city, I may well get assassinated even before I manage to sign the decree." 

 "So, you're just going to stand here and do nothing, then?" Daren asks.
"Not at all," Golmyck says. "In fact, I have been working for years to improve our relations with the animal kingdom for this exact purpose. Their territories have been getting smaller and smaller due to the increasing number of monster attacks in recent years, so their negotiators have become a little less rigid lately. I promised to provide them shelter within our walls, on the condition that they help us clear the lessathi threat from our city. I will have a meeting in this very room with one of the representatives of the animal kingdom in a few days, where we will discuss this exact topic. If everything goes well, it is very likely that we will be reaching an agreement in the next few months."

"So, what you're trying to say here is that you've got everything under control, and that we should no longer interfere?" Hadrik asks.

"Yes, exactly," Golmyck says. "I wanted to make sure that you were aware of the whole situation, in case you'd be tempted to do something rash again."

"As far as I know, the lessathi from my city are not using any mages as bodyguards," Golmyck says. "My spies would have certainly found out by now, if there were any other artificial mages in Thilias."

"I see..." Kate says.

"There's one more thing I need to tell you all before you leave," Golmyck says, as he turns towards the rest of us. "If you manage to survive the arena and win your freedom, you will need to stop by my castle again, in order to receive some documents which will prove that you've served your sentence for your crimes. While these documents will most likely not be needed in Thilias, they should help you deal with guards that might try to have you arrested in other cities, for the murder of the earl of Ollendor. Now, unless you have anything else to discuss with me, I will start writing on that letter of admission for the dwarf, and then you can be on your way."

"Oh?" Golmyck says, while stroking his chin. "And do you speak for your entire team, when you are making this proposal, young lessathi? Or do you only speak for yourself?"

The gnome's words took me off guard. While we've already been travelling together for a week, I'm not sure if everyone would agree to join me on this potentially suicidal mission.

As I stand there, and try to think of an answer to give the gnome, Daren takes my side, and he puts his hand on my shoulder.

"He speaks for me as well," Daren tells Golmyck. 

"And for me," Hadrik says, as he steps forward. "After hearing what happened to the slave girl, yesterday, I would be more than happy to teach these bastards a lesson, if they are the ones responsible for what's going on in this city."

"Interesting," Golmyck says, and then he turns towards Kate. "What about you, artificial mage? Are you volunteering for this mission as well?"

"These lessathi you spoke of..." Kate says. "Do you know if they are working with other artificial mages? Is there a woman called Diane, who controls electricity, helping them?"

 "As far as I know, the lessathi from my city are not using any mages as bodyguards," Golmyck says. "My spies would have certainly found out by now, if there were any other artificial mages in Thilias."
"I see..." Kate says, and she pauses for a few seconds. "Even if Diane is not in this city, there is still a chance that the lessathi might know something about her current whereabouts. If you're all planning to storm their headquarters anyway, then I'm coming as well."

"Well, if everyone else is going, then I guess we're going too, right Petal?" Flower says, enthusiastically.

The girl's eyes turn blue again, as Illuna takes a deep sigh, but she doesn't say anything.

"I'll have to admit that I wasn't expecting you all to offer your help so wholeheartedly," Golmyck says.

He takes a few moments to clear his thoughts before he continues.

"Very well, then," Golmyck says. "I will think about what you've said. We will continue this discussion further, once you return from the arena. After you manage to earn your freedom, you will need to stop by my castle again, in order to receive some documents which will prove that you've served your sentence for your crimes.

 Once he's done talking, Golmyck writes a few words on a piece of paper, stamps his seal on the letter, and then gives it to Hadrik, so he can show it to the guards at the arena. Just as we turn to leave, the gnome suddenly remembers that he forgot to tell us something.
"Oh, and one last thing," Golmyck says. "I believe this should go without saying, but I will mention it, nonetheless. You should never talk about anything we've discussed in this room as long as you are inside the city. Not even amongst yourselves. You never know when someone might be listening. I called you into this secure room to chat privately because I felt I could trust you with this information. I hope that you will not betray my trust."

"Of course not..." Daren says. "We will take care."

"Very well, then," Golmyck says. "In that case, I wish you luck in the arena, and may the gods be with you!"

"May they watch over us all," Daren says.

 After we finished our discussion with Golmyck, we said our goodbyes to the gnome, and we left him to work on his devices, while we started to climb up the narrow stairs, one by one. When we reached the throne room, the king's servant was already waiting for us, at the top of the stairs.
"This way, if you please," the servant says, as he starts walking towards the exit. "Make sure that you follow me closely, so you won't get lost."

"Don't worry, Barry, we're right behind you!" Hadrik says, and then he grins at me widely. "Isn't that right, Barry?"

"Oh, shut up," I tell him, as we all start to follow the servant out of the room, and towards our new prison.
