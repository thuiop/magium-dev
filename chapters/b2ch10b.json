I can only suspect that they must have cast a silencing spell around their base of operations, similar to the spell that Melindra cast when she came into my tent the other night.<br/><br/>When we finally get close enough to the camp, we see that the whole area around it is surrounded by four large, twenty foot tall walls, made of rock. By the looks of it, the walls were probably created by an earth elementalist.<br/><br/>\"There's the entrance, over there,\" Nolderan says, as he points towards a door, which also seems to be made out of stone.<br/><br/>\"Quite the impressive camp fortifications you have here, Nolderan,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"Yes, we have a very talented earth elementalist in our team,\" Nolderan says. \"Step right in.\"<br/><br/>He then opens the door for us, and we all step inside, one by one. As soon as we enter the camp, we all finally get to see the faces of the five mages from Nolderan's team. One of them is a dwarf, who is sitting on a stone chair, behind a stone table, some two hundred feet away from us, while drinking a bottle of dwarven ale.

It would be impossible to not know who he is, since his face has been shown in every newspaper, for the past twelve years. The mage that we were looking at right now was none other than Talmak, the Sage of the North.<br/>\"Ahahahahahaha!\" Arraka starts to laugh loudly, all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"Talmak?...\" Daren says, looking very shocked.<br/><br/>\"The Sage of the North?\" Illuna asks, surprised, looking first at Daren, and then at the dwarf in front of us, with a very unimpressed look on her face. \"THIS is the almighty sage you've been talking about?...\"<br/><br/>\"Ahahahaha!\" Arraka keeps laughing in the background.<br/><br/>\"You knew about this, didn't you?\" Illuna says, as she grabs Arraka's amulet by the chain and looks at it directly. \"You knew that one of the mages was a sage from the very beginning!\"<br/><br/>\"Of course I knew!\" Arraka says, still barely containing her laughter. \"But I wanted to see the looks on your faces when you saw him for yourselves!

When we look at her, we see that she has an unusually serious expression on her face.<br/><br/>\"After I snap my fingers, I'm going to need you two to pull me out,\" Melindra tells us, in a low voice. \"Do you understand?\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_hearing || 0) < 2) {%> <br/>When we finally get close enough to the camp, we see that the whole area around it is surrounded by four large, twenty foot tall walls, made of rock.

Flower and I look at each other for a second, in confusion, and then we decide to head towards the sage as well.<br/><br/>The air currents seem to be calming down as I am walking forward. They're probably waiting for me to give them the signal, whenever I want to start flying. As I approach the stone table, I get a better look at the sage and his henchmen. Talmak is of around the same height as Hadrik in his dwarf form, and he has a long, brown beard that covers most of his face. He looks like a typical dwarf. There's nothing special about him, or anything that makes him look particularly intimidating. I can sort of understand why Illuna was so underwhelmed when she first saw him.<br/><br/>The sage is wearing the same type of heavily enchanted leather armor that Nolderan is wearing, and so is the rest of their team, but neither of them seem to be holding any weapons. I'm guessing that Nolderan is the one who enchanted all of their equipment. <br/><br/> Aside from Daren's old master, Talmak's team consists of a banshee, an elf, and two dwarves. Funnily enough, both of the dwarves look more intimidating than the sage. One of them has two big scars on his face, and the other one is wearing an eye patch. The elf has long blond hair, and he has a slim, tall figure. He appears to be rather old, even by elven standards. I'm not really sure how slowly elves age, but I think you'd need to be over one hundred years old to have any noticeable wrinkles on your face. And this elf has got plenty of them.<br/>The woman that the banshee possessed is somewhere in her early thirties. Her eyes are constantly shining with a green light, similarly to how Flower's eyes always shine blue, when Illuna takes over the body. She also has an outwordly aura about her, so it's clear that she is not an artificial mage.<br/><br/>Given that the banshee is obviously long past her awakening stage, I can only assume that the host's soul is long gone, and that the banshee is the only one in control of the body right now. However, I was not aware that a banshee could maintain the original appearance of her host even after her awakening. I thought that Flower and Illuna were a special case, because of the fusion, but it appears I was mistaken. Perhaps I do not know as much about banshees as I would like to believe.<br/><br/>The woman's hair is long and black, and the expression on her face looks ruthless and unforgiving. While we were walking towards her, I could see the banshee take a short glance towards Flower, but then she went back to looking straight ahead of her, awaiting the sage's orders.<br/><br/> All of the members of our team stop about twenty feet or so in front of the stone table, in order to make sure that we have enough space to move, in case a battle erupts between our two groups. Nolderan, of course, walks past us, and he joins his true comrades, who are currently forming a line behind the sage.<br/>\"I see that you are not willing to advance any further,\" Talmak says, as he takes another sip from his dwarven ale bottle. \"No matter. At least you are close enough that I don't need to shout. Let's get down to business, then, shall we?\"<br/><br/>He then puts his bottle down, and places his hands on the table, while looking at us.<br/><br/>\"I think you may have already guessed that all of the pinecone-collecting mages outside are working for me,\" Talmak says. \"They are all mages who have agreed to give up on participating in this tournament, and to spend the rest of their time here helping me win instead. In exchange for their services, they will be receiving generous rewards, many of them unobtainable by normal means. As you all know, when you become a sage, you receive many benefits. You also gain a lot of influence, with many people. And I can use this influence, to make people's wishes come true. Now tell me, Daren, would you not by any chance have any wishes that you would want to come true?\"<br/><br/>\"My wish is to gain access to the Magium,\" Daren says, with a very serious tone in his voice. \"But from what I'm gathering, this is the one wish that you would not want to grant me...\"<br/><br/>",

You already knew that I'd be there, and you were sent to bring me here by the sage, so he'd offer me this deal. I thought I had made myself sufficiently clear that I would not become your henchman when I didn't answer your letter, Sage Talmak.

I'm guessing that master Nolderan must have received a similar letter as well. Except that he actually accepted it.\"<br/><br/>\"Why aren't you being honest with me, Daren?\" Talmak says, as he takes another drink from his bottle. \"Why don't you tell me the real reason why you won't join me? Who else managed to recruit you before I did? Was it Azarius? Nolderan's told me that you've always admired him. But I can offer you more than Azarius ever could. You have no idea how much knowledge you gain access to when you are a sage. There are so many books that are not shown to the general public. So many restricted areas. I could give you access to all of these. And all I'm asking in return is for you to join my team, and to help me win the Magium. Hell, I'll even extend the offer to all your friends, if you want. You only need to say yes.\"<br/><br/> \"I wasn't recruited by Azarius!\" Daren says. \"Don't you understand? I came here on my own! I came here because I'm tired of travelling around the world, trying to save people, while thousands of others are dying somewhere else, where I cannot reach them. No matter how much I trained, or how hard I worked, it was never enough. I couldn't save them all. But once I get the Magium, I may finally become able to achieve my dreams...\"<br/>\"Boy, are you out of your mind?\" Nolderan shouts. \"Are you telling me that you are still holding on to your foolish ideals from back when you were still my pupil? When will you finally grow up and accept reality?\"<br/><br/>\"Grow up?...\" Daren says. \"And then what? Become Talmak's lapdog, like you did? What happened to you? What happened to the master I knew, who was a proud man that was happy and content with teaching people martial arts and enchanting for a living? What happened to that man who would never bend his knee to anyone, regardless of their social status, or their strength?\"<br/><br/>\"That man died long ago,\" Nolderan says. \"He died after I lost my sage status, and after everyone abandoned me, forcing me to take up work as a mercenary. But this time it's different. I'm no longer just working for scraps. If we succeed, here, I could finally turn my life around. And so could you, if you wouldn't keep stubbornly holding on to those childish ideals that you've had ever since I first met you!\"<br/><br/> \"It seems that my old master truly is dead...\" Daren says, as he shakes his head in disappointment. \"But my ideals are not. I am sorry to say that I will be refusing your offer once more, Sage of the North.\"<br/>\"Surely, you must be joking...\" Talmak says. \"You can't seriously be thinking that you have any chance of winning this tournament by yourself, when there are four sages competing against you... There's no way that anyone can be this naive.\"<br/><br/>\"He is serious,\" Nolderan says. \"I can see it in his eyes. It's the same look that he had when he first told me why he wanted to become my disciple. It hasn't changed one bit since then...\"<br/><br/>\"No, this can't be possible...\" Talmak says, in disbelief. \"I refuse to believe that this is actually happening... Someone needs to wake this man up! You there! The one without any magical powers. I don't know if you're Daren's servant, or his advisor, but you seem like a man with his head on his shoulders.

As the twister keeps spinning them round and round, it seems that the base of the tornado is quickly expanding in size, with every second.<br/><br/>So this was her plan all along...

Flower then starts her fire jets, and we both head upwards, while also slowly approaching the tornado.

As soon as I rest a bit, there should no longer be any-- Oh no...\"<br/><br/>As Melindra was talking, a few small twisters were starting to form very close to where our friends are standing.<br/><br/>\"No, no, no!\" Melindra says, as she panics. \"I can't stop the cyclones! I can't stop them from forming! I need to undo them all, quick!\"<br/><br/>\"Just make sure not to also undo the big one by... accident,\" I say, but before I got to finish the sentence, the big twister was already gone, along with all the small ones.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " As soon as they're out of the tornado, the sage and his henchmen start to fall down, while they're coughing and taking large gasps of air. Talmak manages to conjure a floating stone platform out of thin air, and they all land on it, as they're still trying to catch their breaths.<br/>\"Let's go back to the ground and group up with everyone else,\" I say. \"We can start fighting when we're all together.\"<br/><br/>I begin to fly towards the ground, along with Flower, but Melindra is still just floating there, and it appears that she's gotten another sudden headache. The sage notices this immediately, and he uses his powers to magically create a big rock, which he flings towards her, at great speed. Melindra does not get the time to completely block it with her air magic, and the rock hits her hard in the head, making her lose her consciousness.<br/><br/>\"Melindra!\" Flower shouts, as she rushes to stop her from falling.<br/><br/>Just as the sage tries to hit Flower too, Illuna quickly casts her golden cage spell around herself and Melindra, which makes Talmak's rocks break into pieces at the impact with the cage's golden bars.<br/><br/>\"The fox's cage...\" Talmak says, as he watches Illuna starting to heal Melindra, while inside their floating cage.<br/><br/> \"So, you know of the golden fox, then?\" I ask him.<br/>\"I've had more than a few run-ins with her since I came to Varathia, yes,\" the sage says. \"But, more importantly, the situation has now changed. Meet me back down, boy, and we'll have another talk.\"<br/><br/>He then brings his platform to the ground, along with all of his team, while I also go down and land next to Daren and the others. When my feet hit the ground, I can't help but notice that the air currents around me have calmed down, just like when Melindra cast the spell on me earlier. It appears that the currents are made in such a way that they temporarily deactivate whenever I land on the ground, and if I want to fly again, I need to reactivate them by raising my arms above my head.<br/><br/>\"I've changed my mind!\" Talmak says all of a sudden, as people were getting ready for battle. \"There is no more need for us to fight.\"<br/><br/>\"And to what do we owe this sudden change of heart?\" Daren says.<br/><br/> \"You owe it to the stillwater girl, up there in the sky,\" Talmak says. \"You see, I've always been fascinated by the stillwater legends, but I've never really had the chance to see one up close. I've always wanted to study them, and to find out what the source of their power was, but the idea that I would ever have the chance to capture one alive seemed so unlikely, that I never even dared to dream that it might happen. And yet here I am, only a few dozen feet away from an unconscious stillwater, with the only thing standing in my way being that blasted impenetrable cage.\"<br/><br/>",

Nolderan, do we still have those collars we found in the ruins that could restrict someone's ability to cast spells?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, we still have them,\" Nolderan says.<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" Talmak says. \"Then we can chain her up and commence the experiments immediately. The tricky part will be to keep her alive while we dissect her, but I know more than a few ways to get around--\"<br/><br/>Suddenly, Kate shoots several icicles straight at the sage, while a wall of rock raises itself from the ground to defend him. As the wall crumbles, and the icicles that got stuck within it fall to the ground, Talmak stares at Kate, with a look of utter shock in his eyes.<br/><br/>\"Have you gone completely insane?\" Talmak says. \"You would forfeit your only chance to survive, just for the sake of a--\"<br/><br/> \"Stop talking, you filth,\" Kate says, looking at him with an expression of pure disgust.<br/>\"Maybe I haven't made myself sufficiently clear...\" Talmak starts to say, adopting his usual authoritative tone.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, no, I think we've heard enough,\" Hadrik says, and he immediately rushes towards the sage, at a shocking speed.<br/><br/>The sage barely has the time to react, and he conjures another wall of rock in front of him, which Hadrik breaks in one punch.<br/><br/>\"Enough!!!\" Talmak shouts furiously, all of a sudden, as he makes several large spikes of rock pop out from underneath the earth, forcing Hadrik to jump back. \"If you're all so eager to march towards your deaths, then I will be more than happy to grant your wishes. I'm going to kill you all myself, and I'm saving the stillwater for last.\"<br/><br/>\"No, you won't,\" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he makes another lightning fast rush towards the sage, and he attacks him with a flurry of blows, while Talmak is struggling to create enough walls to keep up with his speed.<br/><br/>As Hadrik and the sage have begun their duel, the five henchmen are now getting ready to attack the rest of us.<br/><br/>",

I guess I'm going to have to deal with the sage on my own, for now.<br/><br/>As I continue to punch through rocks on my way to Talmak's platform, the sage just keeps creating more and more of them, making it hard to keep up. Now that I'm looking at the ground, I see that there are also large pieces of rock that got broken off from the earth itself, which are coming towards me at great speed.

Tough luck, eh?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm going to greatly enjoy shutting up that smart-ass mouth of yours for good, boy,\" Talmak says, as he flings another three boulders towards me, which I easily dodge.<br/><br/>\"Now you're starting to sound like all those generic thugs that I've beaten on my way here,\" I say. \"Don't you have any better lines to say than that?\"<br/><br/>While I keep flying around in circles, I take a look below me, to see what's happening, and apparently Daren was in the middle of a duel with Nolderan when Hadrik landed on the ground and turned himself back into a dwarf. <br/><br/>Without giving it much thought, Hadrik makes a quick dash towards Nolderan, and he punches him so hard that he throws him into a nearby wall. He then says something to Daren, and he points in my direction. After that, Daren starts healing himself, while Hadrik goes to fight Nolderan in his stead.<br/><br/> In the meantime, Kate and Leila are busy battling the two dwarf henchmen, who are both fire elementalists, while the elf is making semi-transparent barriers, to defend against Kate's icicles. The banshee on their side is also battling one of my teammates, but it shocks me to find out that this adversary of hers is in fact Illuna. <br/>I quickly take a look to see what happened to the golden cage and Melindra, and it would seem that they're both in the same place as before. This means that Illuna most likely teleported out, with that daily spell of hers, while leaving Melindra safely inside the cage to continue recovering from her wounds. <br/><br/>As I observe the black-haired banshee's fighting style, I arrive at the conclusion that she must be a generalist of some kind. She's casting all sorts of spells, ranging from lightning, to fire, to ice, and she also has a few summoned eagles by her side. Either way, I don't really have time to study the battlefield in more detail. It's hard enough to dodge the sage's attacks even without being distracted. <br/><br/>I dance around in the sky with Talmak and his boulders for a while longer, until I suddenly hear Daren's voice coming from below us.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Talmak!\" Daren shouts. \"Come down here so we can have a duel! One on one! What kind of a coward flies off to the sky like that, where his enemies can't reach him?\"<br/><br/> \"Watch your tongue, healer in armor!\" Talmak shouts. \"Who do you think you're talking to?\"<br/>\"He does kind of have a point, though,\" I say, in a loud voice, to make sure that Daren can hear me. \"If you really are the strongest earth elementalist of our time, like they say, shouldn't you be able to win against us without these petty tricks? They don't let you fly into the air while you're fighting in the yearly sage contests, do they? So why are you doing that now? Is it because you're afraid of Daren?\"<br/><br/>\"What did you just say?...\" Talmak says.<br/><br/>\"He's asking if you're afraid of me, Talmak,\" Daren shouts. \"Answer the man's question, will you?\"<br/><br/>\"This insolence is going to cost you, healer,\" Talmak says. \"I don't care what the legends say about you. I'm going to pound you into the ground and show you what happens when you mock a sage!\"<br/><br/>He then quickly brings his floating platform to the ground, with a loud thud, as he steps off it, and begins to approach Daren. I fly towards them as well, and then I land on the ground, in order to get a better view of the fight.<br/><br/>",

While the barrier itself is not visible with the naked eye, you can tell that it's still there, by the feel of its magical aura.<br/><br/>\"Nobody asked you to wait for us,\" Illuna says, in a cold voice. \"You could have attacked us at any time.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I would have attacked you long ago,\" the dwarf with the eye patch says, \"if this sad excuse for an elf hadn't surrounded us all with an impenetrable barrier that works both ways!\"<br/><br/>\"I will remove the barrier as soon as our banshee friend is done asking her questions,\" the elf says, in a calm manner. \"And also as soon as you promise to not get caught in every single one of the enemy's deadly attacks, like a gang of amateurs.\"<br/><br/> \"That banshee from the amulet that you called Arraka...\" the black-haired banshee starts to ask Illuna, while ignoring the elf. \"How old is she, exactly? Do you happen to know if she's been around for more than a thousand years? Perhaps even five thousand?\"<br/>\"Oh, I've been living for quite a bit more than five thousand years, little girl,\" Arraka says. \"But I think we should both stop beating around the bush. What is it that you want to ask of me, exactly?\"<br/><br/>\"I will ask you this directly, then,\" the banshee says, with a dark look in her eyes. \"Did you, or did you not cause the banishment of all banshees from the magical realm five thousand years ago?\"<br/><br/>",

Oh man, it looks like not even getting trapped in a mountain for thousands of years is enough to extinguish the flame of a true legend! I am so proud, right now, you have no idea.\"<br/>\"So it is true...\" the black-haired banshee says, with the look in her eyes now darker than ever. \"I always knew that those rumors were true. The only reason why I came to Varathia was because my information led me to believe that this was where I could find you. And as soon as I felt that sinister aura coming from the amulet, I knew that it would be you. All this pain and suffering that our race has had to endure for millennia... Being forced to live our lives as parasites... All because of you!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" Arraka says, in a provocative tone.<br/><br/>\"I am going to end you!\" the banshee shouts. \"I will avenge every single banshee that you've cursed with this torturous existence.\"<br/><br/>\"If you destroy this amulet, you will only free her,\" Illuna says. \"And you will doom us all.\"<br/><br/> \"If she goes free, then I will kill her again, and again, and again, until she is dead for good,\" the black-haired banshee says, with her eyes full of rage. \"And if you stand in my way, I will kill you too. Undo this barrier, elf. It's about time that we all settled our scores.\"<br/>\"Finally,\" the elf says, as he dismisses his barrier. \"Try not to die in the first five seconds, will you?\"<br/><br/>Just as soon as the barrier disappears, the two dwarves channel their magic into a single ray of fire, which they use to attack Kate's ice dome. The ice is being reinforced almost as fast as it is melted, but it's clear that Kate won't be able to keep this up much longer. In the meantime, the black-haired banshee flies up in the sky, and begins to attack Illuna and Flower with a variety of spells. <br/><br/>Judging by the very different types of spells that she's using, I'm going to guess that she is some sort of a generalist. She's already cast a lightning spell, a sonic spell and a freezing spell, one after the other, while also summoning a few eagles to try and catch Illuna by surprise. Luckily, Flower has done a good job at avoiding the attacks in mid-air, although neither she nor Illuna have managed to land a hit on their adversary, just yet.<br/><br/> While she is still busy reinforcing the ice dome, Kate shoots a few more icicles at the dwarves, but this time, the projectiles get stopped even further up in the air, by what seems to be a small, flat, semi-transparent barrier, that the elf conjured to intercept them. The elf smiles at Kate, from a distance, which makes Kate frown at him, as she turns her head to Leila and me.<br/>\"If either of you could keep some of those three mages busy, while I attack them, it would be highly appreciated...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>",

It looks like Hadrik is at a bit of a disadvantage when fighting aerial battles, due to the fact that the flying creatures which he can morph into are too weak, compared to his regular dwarf form, and he needs to switch back to being a dwarf every time he wants to smash one of the rocks into pieces.<br/><br/>Somewhere below, at a much lower altitude, Illuna and Flower are still busy fighting the black-haired banshee, in mid-flight, although they seem to be very evenly matched, and neither of them has managed to do any significant damage to the other. Flower and Illuna may have the upper hand, in terms of raw power, because there are two of them, but the banshee working for the sage is making good use of the multitude of spells she has at her disposal to compensate for her disadvantage.<br/><br/><% } %>",

I'm just going to keep this barrier up until you either tire yourselves out, or get bored. You won't be able to break it anytime soon at this rate.\"<br/>\"Right...\" I say, as I continue to attack him.<br/><br/>While we're dealing with the elf, I can't help but notice that the sky above us is currently filled with big, floating rocks, which Talmak is using to chase Hadrik around, in his eagle form. It looks like Hadrik is at a bit of a disadvantage when fighting aerial battles, due to the fact that the flying creatures which he can morph into are too weak, compared to his regular dwarf form, and he needs to switch back to being a dwarf every time he wants to smash one of the rocks into pieces.<br/><br/>Somewhere below, at a much lower altitude, Illuna and Flower are still busy fighting the black-haired banshee, in mid-flight, although they seem to be very evenly matched, and neither of them has managed to do any significant damage to the other. Flower and Illuna may have the upper hand, in terms of raw power, because there are two of them, but the banshee working for the sage is making good use of the multitude of spells she has at her disposal to compensate for her disadvantage.<br/><br/>",

The ex-sage doesn't look like he's taken any hits, so far, while Daren is already moving much slower than before, and he appears to have been injured during their battle. I'm not sure how long he'll be able to last at this rate. Maybe I should go help him?<br/>Before I get to think any further on the subject, Hadrik quickly lands on the ground, in his eagle form, and then he turns himself into a dwarf. The sage is still up above, on his platform, with all of his rocks floating around him, and he seems to be waiting for Hadrik's next move.<br/><br/>\"Give up, Daren,\" Nolderan says, with a confident tone in his voice, as he manages to wound Daren yet again, by attacking one of his armor's elbow joints. \"I can see that you've learned some new techniques since we've been apart, but you're still no match for me. Maybe if you beg Sage Talmak for mercy, he might still spare your--\"<br/><br/>The ex-sage does not get to finish his sentence, because Hadrik suddenly dashes to his side, and he punches him so hard, that he throws him into a nearby wall.<br/><br/>\"I think you may have forgotten that this is a team fight, not a duel, old man,\" Hadrik tells him, with a grin. \"You might want to mind your surroundings a little more, next time.\"<br/><br/>\"I'll keep that in mind,\" Nolderan says, as he struggles to get back up.<br/><br/> \"I'll deal with your old master,\" Hadrik tells Daren. \"You go deal with the sage. Elementalists are supposed to be your specialty, aren't they?\"<br/>\"They are,\" Daren says, as he starts casting a healing spell on himself. \"I'll take care of him.\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect!\" Hadrik says. \"Come on, Nolderan, let's have ourselves a fun little sparring match!\"<br/><br/>He then rushes towards Daren's old master, and he tries to punch him again, but this time Nolderan was waiting for him, and he dodged his attack effortlessly. As the two of them begin their battle, Daren starts to shout very loudly at the sage, who is still in the sky, waiting for his next opponent.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Talmak!\" Daren shouts, while his wounds are still being magically healed.  \"Come down here so we can have a duel! One on one! What kind of a coward flies off to the sky like that, where his enemies can't reach him?\"<br/><br/>\"Watch your tongue, healer in armor!\" Talmak shouts. \"Who do you think you're talking to?\"<br/><br/> \"He does kind of have a point, though,\" I say, in a loud voice, to make sure that Talmak can hear me. \"If you really are the strongest earth elementalist of our time, like they say, shouldn't you be able to win against us without these petty tricks? They don't let you fly into the air while you're fighting in the yearly sage contests, do they? So why are you doing that now? Is it because you're afraid of Daren?\"<br/>\"What did you just say?...\" Talmak says.<br/><br/>\"He's asking if you're afraid of me, Talmak,\" Daren shouts. \"Answer the man's question, will you?\"<br/><br/>\"This insolence is going to cost you, healer,\" Talmak says. \"I don't care what the legends say about you. I'm going to pound you into the ground and show you what happens when you mock a sage!\"<br/><br/>He then quickly brings his floating platform to the ground, with a loud thud, as he steps off it, and begins to approach Daren, who is now completely healed.<br/><br/>",

The wind blades are likely sharpened in the same way that Illuna or Kate sharpen their own elements, and they are mostly transparent, except for when the light of the sun shines on them.<br/><br/>While Melindra is raising herself higher up, the giant made of stone begins to move forward, at a slow pace, and the sage's henchmen are now hurrying to get out of the golem's way, so that they won't get stepped on.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, Melindra loses control of one of her wind blades, which flies at an incredible speed right into the ground in front of us, cutting through it as if it were made from paper.<br/><br/>\"Damn...\" Daren says, as he looks at the hole in the ground left by the blade from earlier. \"I really hope that my barrier is strong enough to protect us from one of these, if it hits us...\"<br/><br/><% } %>",
