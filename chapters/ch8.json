Did they come by here while I was still unconscious?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" says Daren. \"A tiger and a bear came by earlier and started growling at us. At first, I thought the jailers sent their pets here to scare us, but then Kate and Rose started talking to them, by making weird animal noises. It turns out that all of the animals and monsters on this continent can speak, but they only use ancient languages. Monsters can't speak in the common tongue because they don't know any better, and the animals aren't allowed to speak it because their spirit fox leader has forbidden its use after the humans started hunting them for food. It also turns out that having a basic understanding of ancient languages is not so uncommon if you were born on this continent.\"<br/><br/>\"Never mind all that,\" I tell Daren. \"Did they say what they want from us?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, they said that we should wait here until their great golden fox arrives, and they apparently kept making jokes about how she will teach us all a lesson.\"<br/><br/>\"So, why aren't they guarding us, then? What's to stop us from just breaking through the walls and escaping?\"<br/><br/>\"These,\" Daren says, as he points at his neck.<br/><br/> For the first time, I notice that we are all wearing green collars around our necks, with strange markings written on them. I turn to Kate.<br/>\"Wait, are these--\" I start to ask her but she cuts me off.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" she answers me. \"They're the same type of collars that the ancients used on artificial mages at the Beacon of Hope in order to keep their powers under control. The good news is that I know how to turn them off. The bad news is that we need to find the device that's powering all of these collars, before I can use it to deactivate them. These ruins were also built by the lessathi of old, so if they are anything like the Beacon, then there should be a control room not far from here.\"<br/><br/>\"But if none of you can cast spells, then why is Hadrik still in his dwarf form?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I was wondering about that too,\" Hadrik says. \"I guess the collars don't actually dispel any spell that you cast on yourself before wearing them. They just prevent you from casting any more magic. The first thing I tried when I woke up was to turn into a giant, but this damn collar won't let me cast any sort of shapeshifting magic.\"<br/><br/>\"You say that you can't cast any magic...\" I tell him. \"But you still have your superhuman strength, right?\"<br/><br/> \"Aye!\" Hadrik says, grinning. \"But even with my power, I still can't smash the collar around my neck. These blasted contraptions seem to be near indestructible. Now I was checking to see if the walls are as durable as the collars, but it looks like they're just made up of regular stones. I should be able to break through them without any problem!\"<br/><br/>",

What if they're baiting us to escape, so that they can capture us again on more severe charges? Right now, the only thing we're guilty of is temporarily trespassing on their territory. Given that we are outsiders and do not know these lands very well, we should have extenuating circumstances. But if we try to escape now, we'll most surely have to fight some of the animals, and we might even be forced to kill some of them. Do we really want to make enemies of an entire race just because of a small misunderstanding?\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Hadrik says thoughtfully, while stroking his beard. \"The lad does have a point.\"<br/><br/>\"You can't be serious!\" Daren tells him.<br/><br/>\"Rose,\" I continue, \"didn't you tell us that this spirit fox of theirs is like some kind of god? Isn't she like, crazy strong?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, yes,\" Rose says. \"She is thousands of years old and likely dwarfs the power of most mages from this tournament.\"<br/><br/>\"So, would you choose to make her into our enemy right off the bat, knowing that there might be a small chance to talk things through with her if we just have a little patience?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, when you put it like that, I suppose I wouldn't!\" Rose says, smiling.<br/><br/>",

We'll have a talk with this great golden fox and see where we go from there.\"<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for the animals' leader to make her appearance. Her shape is that of a normal fox, but her fur is so bright that it looks like it's made of actual gold. The magical aura that she emanates is rather intimidating, and it also gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?<br/><br/>The fox is being accompanied by a leopard and a bull, one on her left side and one on her right, just like two bodyguards walking alongside some rich noble kid. When they all stop in front of our cell, the fox starts speaking to us, in the common tongue.<br/><br/> \"Greetings, outsiders,\" she says. \"I am Eleya, the golden fox, and these are my two trusted lieutenants, Leo the leopard and Taurus the bull.\"<br/>\"Leo and Taurus!\" Daren says, in a low voice. \"Name creativity at its best!\"<br/><br/>\"Shouldn't Leo be a lion's name, though?\" Hadrik asks him.<br/><br/>\"Shhhh!\" Rose tells them, looking frantically at the three animals to see if any of them heard their banter.<br/><br/>The bull seems to have both heard and understood Daren's jest, as he is now looking straight at him, with a furious look in his eyes. The leopard either didn't hear his remark, or didn't deem it worthy of a reaction on his part. The fox simply ignores them altogether, and continues her speech, as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>\"My loyal subjects informed me that you were caught trespassing on our sacred grounds.

She then does an elegant pirouette and turns towards us.<br/>\"See?\" she tells us. \"Everything's under control!\"<br/><br/>As soon as she finishes talking, one of the walls opens up and a large pendulum blade comes swinging out of it, aiming directly for Flower. She rolls out of its way, and triggers two more traps by accident. There are now dozens of arrows shooting out of both walls, while sharp spinning blades are coming out of the floor and moving in circles all around her. At first glance, the girl appears to be just clumsily stumbling around while evading the traps out of sheer luck. As I watch her more closely, I realize that even though her movements all seem erratic, they have a way of flowing into one another which allows her to not waste even a single second between two actions. I guess she wasn't kidding when she said that she came to this place to train her acrobatic skills.<br/><br/>Hadrik shakes his head as he watches the girl jump around, and then he lays flat on the floor, with his ear pressing against the ground, trying to listen for something.<br/><br/>\"Uh, guys, I know this looks bad,\" Flower tells us as she jumps off a wall, lands on her left hand and then bounces off the floor like a spring, \"but if I keep going like this, I'll either remember the right path, or end up setting off all of the traps, so it's a win either way!\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, no, this is clearly not getting us anywhere,\" Hadrik says, as he stands up, \"That fox is going to be here any minute. We can't afford to dawdle here while the girl tests all the traps. This corridor is compromised, but I could hear some noise below us. These ruins have a subterranean level waiting to be found, and I'm about to create a shortcut to it!\"<br/>\"Don't you DARE!\" Kate shouts.<br/><br/>\"What's that?\" Hadrik asks with a grin. \"I'm having trouble hearing you because of all the noise those traps are making!\"<br/><br/>He then punches the ground below us, which cracks all of the stones, and sends us falling down along with all of the rubble that used to make up the floor beneath our feet. It was a longer way down than I would have hoped, but fortunately, the surface we landed on was soft enough that we didn't break anything from the fall.<br/><br/>\"Hadrik, how could you do something so reckless?!\" Kate shouts. \"Do you think we're all giants in disguise like you? Do you realize that if this unusually soft surface wasn't here to break our fall, we would have broken all our bones? I swear, if I still had my ice powers I would have smacked you so hard in the head that I'd have left you in a coma!\"<br/><br/>As Kate talks, I can feel the surface we're on move slowly up and down. I can also hear a continuous low growl somewhere above us. Something's not right, here.<br/><br/>",

Last time I fought one of these, I had more than enough time to cut off all the heads before they started regenerating, but there's no way that's going to work with this particular monster. The only way we're killing it is if we can find out where its heart is and stab it, or if we use fire, to prevent it from regenerating.\"<br/>\"Damnations...\" Kate says. \"If only I had my ice magic, I would have easily cut all those heads off simultaneously...\"<br/><br/>\"Didn't that little girl have fire magic?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>He then starts to shout the girl's name, while looking at the hole in the roof.<br/><br/>\"Flower!

Trying to locate the source of the sound, I realize that it isn't coming from one of us, but from the hydra. I start to block out all other sounds with my mind and focus solely on the loud beating of the monster's heart, in order to pinpoint its exact location. It takes me a few seconds, but in the end I manage to trace the sound back to its origin: the tip of the hydra's tail. So that's where it was hiding its weak point!<br/><br/>\"Well,\" Hadrik says. \"If it's not going to come to us...\"<br/><br/>He doesn't finish his sentence and rushes straight for the nine-headed creature. The monster attacks the dwarf with four of its heads, but he jumps out of their way and manages to place himself below the hydra's body. Hadrik then flexes all of his muscles and starts lifting the hydra off the ground, as he roars loudly and his face turns almost red from the effort. <br/><br/>Before the hydra has the time to react, the dwarf sends it crashing into the nearest wall.

Her shape may be that of a normal fox, but her aura gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?<br/><br/>As I look around, I see that the room we are in is filled with levers and buttons of all shapes and sizes, just like Flower said, and there are strange writings on all of the walls.

However, if there were such a rule, and a cub or a fawn were to break it, then I assure you I would not hesitate in ordering their execution. Rules are meant to be upheld, both by humans and by animals. The fact that you humans are so lenient with your rules is one of the main reasons why your society is decaying to such a degree.
