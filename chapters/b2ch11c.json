        "text": " \"Huh...\" Daren says. \"I'm not sure if I should be feeling reassured that we will be having a good chance of stopping the calamity, or worried that we'll likely be right in the middle of it, when it happens. Either way, we shouldn't be thinking about that now. What we should be focusing on is trying to interrupt the ritual. If Rose can't do it with her powers, then maybe it's time to take matters into our own hands. Hadrik, come with me for a second. I want you to help me take a look around, and see if we can spot something out of the ordinary.\"<br/>\"Alright,\" Hadrik says. \"Lead the way.\"<br/><br/>\"Did you really walk all the way here without any rest?\" Flower asks Rose, worried, as Daren and Hadrik are moving away from us. \"Aren't you tired? Don't you need to eat?\"<br/>      <br/>\"No, I'm fine... for some reason,\" Rose says. \"I'm not hungry at all, and I'm not tired either. Actually I feel just as well rested as I was before leaving my home. I wonder if it's because of the trance...\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, it's the trance,\" Arraka says. \"You were basically put in a magical stasis for the duration of your walk, so that you wouldn't need any rest, food or water. If the God of Time hadn't intervened to pull you out of your trance prematurely, you probably wouldn't even have remembered that any of this had happened.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I see,\" Rose says. \"That explains it, then.\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/> \"Uhm, Arraka,\" Rose continues, \"you wouldn't happen to know if time weavers had any other powers than freezing and reversing time, would you?\"<br/>\"So, you want to practice, huh?\" Arraka says. \"Well, I'm pretty sure that you should also have the ability to slow down time. From our perspective, it would look as if you were moving really fast, though. The advantage of slowing down time is that you can also interact with other people, while doing it. I think you might also be able to un-slow people from time, in the same way that you can unfreeze them from time, as long as they are somewhere near you, but I'm not completely sure if that comes as a time weaver power, or if it's just a really complex spell. Aside from these powers, I can't say that I'm aware of any others.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you!\" Rose says. \"I can't seem to be able to reverse time at all, but maybe I'll find a way to use that time-slowing spell you mentioned. Let me give it a try.\"<br/><br/>Not long after her conversation with Arraka, Rose begins to test her powers, while Kate and Flower are helping her with some indications. In the meantime, Daren and Hadrik are apparently still walking around, trying to see if they can find anything unusual that could help them spot a weakness in the ritual. As I am looking around, to see what everyone is doing, I suddenly realize that Leila hasn't participated in any of our discussions, so far, and she has barely even moved from her spot since the ritual started. At the moment, she is just looking at the ground, while avoiding making eye-contact with any of us.<br/><br/> Could it be that she still didn't manage to get over what happened in her first trial? Come to think of it, she was also at the Beacon, so it wouldn't be too surprising if she got a similar ritual to that of Kate. That is not good... Kate might be strong enough to endure the emotional trauma caused by such a trial, but what about Leila? Maybe I should go talk to her, and see how she's holding out.<br/>\"Leila, is everything alright?\" I say, as I get a little closer to her.<br/><br/>Leila looks surprised, when she hears my voice. I think she has gotten used to being ignored in these situations, due to her quiet nature and her generally weak sense of presence.<br/><br/>She raises her head, to look me in the eyes, and then she nods, slightly, in order to answer my question.<br/><br/>\"I'm fine,\" Leila writes. \"Just a little shaken up, that's all.\"<br/><br/>\"Do you want to talk about it?...\" I ask her.<br/><br/>Again, Leila looks at me surprised, for a second, but then she smiles faintly, as she writes a new text in the air, in front of me.<br/><br/>\"Not now,\" Leila writes. \"But maybe later...\"<br/><br/>",

Eventually, a bright white light covered our area once again, and this time, I could feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, instead of only my consciousness.<br/><br/>When the light fades away, we all find ourselves in the middle of a city which is... unusual, to say the least. The first thing that catches my attention is that there is one very large black tower in every corner of the city,  and on top of each of these four towers, there is an incredible amount of magical energy, that can be seen even with the naked eye. The energy has a purple color, and it is moving wildly in every direction, as if it were trying to escape its prison. On each side of these thousand foot tall towers, there are big, floating platforms, that keep going up and down at a slow speed, and they seem to be carrying hundreds of people towards the levels of the towers that they need to reach.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch4_spared_dave || 0) == 0) {%> Leaving these strange, tall buildings aside, what is even more peculiar is what's happening directly above us. Currently, there are hundreds of metal, horseless carriages, flying through the air, with people inside them. While these carriages are flying around, there are large holographic screens floating above us, picturing a man that is relaying the same message, over and over, in the Common language. The holographic screens look just like the ones that were created by Golmyck's illusion-casting device, when he announced our first objectives. The message that keeps getting repeated is: 'All non-lessathi citizens are to present themselves to the military reserve area immediately. We are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack!'.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Even those time spells of hers must have their limitations. If we all work together, we should be able to figure out what they are.\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a large ice wall forms itself in front of Daren, separating him and Hadrik from the revenant.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_defend || 0) == 0) {%> \"How about we all calm down and take a break, before we do something really stupid?\" Kate says, with an ice cold tone in her voice.<br/>\"Kate, I appreciate what you are trying to do,\" the revenant says, as she steps away from her current position and goes to walk around the wall of ice, \"but I assure you that it's not necessary. In fact, I think that Daren and Hadrik both need to experience the futility of their actions, before they'll be ready to work with me as a team. Please do not provide any help. I will fight them both myself.\"<br/><br/>\"Those are some brave words,\" Hadrik says, with a grin. \"Let's see if you've got what it takes to back them up.\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b2_ch11_defend || 0) == 0) {%> He then immediately rushes towards the revenant, at great speed, and tries to punch her, but she just disappears, right before he lands his strike, and she reappears much further away from him, while looking at him with her usual lack of human emotion in her eyes. Hadrik doesn't let himself get intimidated, and he tries to dash for her yet again, even though this yields him the same results. The third time, it is Daren who tries to slash at her with his sword, but she effortlessly evades his attack as well, by disappearing and reappearing, like the last two times.<br/>\"What the hell?...\" Hadrik says. \"How do you keep doing that? I thought that the time was already frozen!\"<br/><br/>\"It is frozen for the rest of the world, but not for you,\" the revenant says. \"All I need is to freeze you in time along with the rest of the world, and then I'll have plenty of time to move out of your way before you get to land your blow. But these powers are not good only for defense. They are also very useful for offense. Like so.\"<br/><br/>She then disappears again, but this time, she reappears right behind Daren, holding a knife at his throat.<br/><br/>\"Do you surrender, healer, or do we need to continue?\" the revenant says.<br/><br/><% } %>",

You also don't seem to have the ability to reverse time at will, because if you did, you would have done so, already. In other words--\"<br/><br/>Daren now pulls on the revenant's hand, lifting her on his back, and then he throws her to the ground, in front of him, while making sure that he still holds onto her, as firmly as possible.<br/><br/>\"--you are now more vulnerable than ever,\" Daren continues his phrase from before, as he pulls out his sword from its scabbard, while still holding onto the revenant with his other hand.<br/><br/>He then slashes at her throat with one quick strike of his blade, and he severs her head from her shoulders, in a single movement.<br/><br/>\"Daren...\" Kate says, as she's almost about to cry. \"What have you done?...\"<br/><br/> \"I only did what I had to--\" I hear Daren saying, but all of a sudden, everything in my mind becomes a complete blur, and then I get the very weird feeling that I've only just woken up from a dream.<br/>Instead of seeing the revenant dead in front of my eyes, I get to witness the scene where she puts a dagger to Daren's throat for a second time, except now she does not wait for him to grab her, and she immediately jumps back, making sure that she is no longer anywhere near his range of attack.<br/><br/>What is happening, here? Did I seriously fall asleep in the middle of the battle and had a dream where Daren killed the revenant? Could I have gotten hit by a mind-affecting spell without noticing? I can clearly tell that this is the reality, and that what I saw earlier was only in my imagination, but why would I have had such a vision in a tense moment like this?   <br/><br/>\"No...\" Daren says, seemingly in a state of shock, as he points towards the revenant. \"That's not possible. You were dead! I made sure of it. Even a revenant will die, if their head is cut clean off their shoulders. And yet, I saw with my own eyes how everything got reversed, just like that time when Arraka got out of the amulet! Who was it that reversed the time, if not you?\"<br/><br/> A time-reversal spell?... Of course! Now I understand why I felt like I woke up from a dream. The time was only reversed for Daren and the revenant, so they were the only ones who got to see all of the spell's effects. For the rest of us, who were not caught in the spell's area of effect, it was as if these events never even happened...<br/>\"The time did not get reversed as a result of a spell that I cast,\" the revenant says. \"It got reversed thanks to a trait that all time weavers possess, which protects them from getting killed before they finish delivering their prophecy. No matter how many times I get killed, the time will always reverse itself up to a point where I am safe enough to escape from peril. This is why I said that your actions were futile. Even if I were to die, you still wouldn't get to kill me for good.\"<br/><br/>\"You're lying!\" Daren says. \"If what you said were true, then how did Rose die? Why didn't the time reverse itself to save her, like it saved you?\"<br/><br/>\"The only reason why the time didn't get reversed for Rose was because of the revenant spell cast on her before she died,\" the revenant says. \"The Magium does not care who gets to inhabit a time weaver's body, as long as it can still fulfill its purpose of delivering the prophecy. Given that I was already scheduled to take Rose's body after her death, there was no need for the time reversal spell to activate, so I became the time weaver, in her place.\"<br/><br/>\"So... Rose would have still been alive, if it wasn't for you?...\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>",

She wasn't the one who asked to be put in this body, nor was she the one who asked to serve the God of Death. We can't really blame her for any of this.\"<br/>She then goes over to the revenant, and she grabs both her hands, gently, as she looks into her eyes.<br/><br/>\"Listen,\" Kate says. \"I'm not sure what to call you. 'Revenant' sounds too cold, but I am also aware that you are not the Rose I know. However, if there's anything of Rose left within you, like you said, then please, come travel with us. Forget about the God of Death. You don't need to let him control you any longer. We can try to hide from him together, or we could fight him, or... something. You don't have to go through all of this alone.\"<br/><br/>The revenant pulls her hands away from Kate, and she takes one step back, as her expressionless gaze momentarily turns into one of sadness and regret.<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry,\" the revenant says. \"I am not who you think I am. You should avoid trying to get any closer to me, for your own safety. I was not lying when I said that I would kill you in a heartbeat, if my master ordered me to. My loyalty towards the God of Death will always come first, and you need to understand that. If you put too much trust in me, you're only going to end up getting hurt. It is the Rose part of me that is warning you to stay away from me. Can you understand that?...\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Kate says, with a somewhat disappointed look in her eyes, as she takes a few steps back. \"I understand. I won't try to meddle in your affairs anymore. And thank you for the warning...\"<br/>\"So, what are we going to do now?\" Hadrik says. \"Work together, like nothing happened?\"<br/><br/>\"It doesn't seem like we have much of a choice,\" Daren says, reluctantly, as he sheaths his sword.<br/><br/>\"What about the God of Death?\" Melindra says, in a serious tone, while she has her arms crossed. \"What are you going to tell him when you get back, revenant?\"<br/><br/>\"If he ever asks, then I will tell him the truth,\" the revenant says. \"I will tell him that I was the one who started the battle, because I wanted to prove my superiority. That way, there should be no reason for him to bear any resentment towards your group.\"<br/><br/>\"I see...\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"However,\" the revenant says, \"I do not think that the God of Death will ask me anything upon my return. From his point of view, nothing will have happened, since time will remain frozen until I come back. He will likely continue to ignore me, just as he's been doing ever since I first contacted him, and I will be forced to keep waiting in one of his temples, until he sees fit to give me an order.\"<br/><br/>\"He's ignoring you?\" Kate asks. \"But... why?\"<br/><br/> \"The God of Death does not trust me,\" the revenant says. \"He thinks that I am an undercover agent, sent by the God of Time to infiltrate his followers, and nothing that I've said has been able to change his mind on the matter. He even tried to kill me a few times, but he gave up after he saw that it was impossible to do so. Currently, I am not allowed to leave the temple that I entered when I first contacted him, and he is keeping me in the dark about most of his plans, out of fear that I might leak the information to the God of Time.\"<br/>Arraka laughs.<br/><br/>\"That does sound just like him!\" she says. \"Ulruk has always been very paranoid when it came to the God of Time. I can only imagine how shocked he was when he found a time weaver right on his doorstep, revenant or no. You'd better find yourself a hobby, because you're probably going to be sitting in that temple for a long time.\"<br/><br/>",

Otherwise, even if you have available points to spend, the stat device won't let you manually add any extra points, over the maximum level of four. Sadly, it seems that we will need to go with my secondary plan. There is also another way to find out the information we need, but it is less effective. Does anyone in this group have a particularly keen magical sense?\"<br/><br/> As soon as the revenant finishes her sentence, we all turn towards Arraka's amulet.<br/>\"Arraka, will you--\" Illuna starts to say, but she is interrupted.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, yeah, I get it,\" Arraka says. \"What do I need to do?\"<br/><br/>\"First of all, you're going to need to get as close as you can to the place where the God of Time first materialized into this world,\" the revenant says.<br/><br/>\"I'm on it!\" Flower says, as she jumps into the air and starts her fire jets.<br/><br/>She then flies all the way up to where the God of Time was floating when he first made his appearance, and she stops, turning her head towards the revenant.<br/><br/>\"I'm here,\" Flower says. \"Now what?\"<br/><br/>",

You won't be able to hear them unless you block out all other sounds with your mind, and focus exclusively on those voices. Can you do it?\"<br/>\"I'll try,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Take your time,\" the revenant says. \"The second stage of the ritual is still a long way from beginning.\"<br/><br/>As I block all of the sounds around me and focus only on this small area, like the revenant said, I suddenly become aware of some barely audible voices, which are all talking at the same time. It's already difficult enough to actually hear the voices, but to also be able to make out what they are saying, I'm going to require a lot more concentration than this. I start to focus even further, until I'm able to separate what each person is saying. I manage to identify a few dialogues this way, but after a while, I get a very intense headache, and I am forced to stop.<br/><br/>\"Is everything alright?...\" the revenant asks me, as she sees me massaging my forehead, while I'm keeping my eyes closed.<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say, as I'm still trying to recover from the pain. \"I just got a sudden headache, that's all.\"<br/><br/> \"If you needed to focus so hard that you got a headache, then you shouldn't force yourself any longer,\" the revenant says. \"We wouldn't want you to faint of exhaustion in the middle of the ritual. Did you manage to find out anything useful?\"<br/>\"Yes,\" I say, as I slowly stop massaging my forehead and open my eyes to look at her. \"There was a woman whose voice I couldn't recognize, gloating about the fact that she had cast some sort of spell on you, to prevent you from concentrating on freezing time. That's about all the useful information I had time to gather, before the headache hit me.\"<br/><br/>\"A spell that would prevent me from freezing time?\" the revenant says. \"It must be a dizziness spell of some sort. Does anyone here know how to cast any magical protections against dizziness?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, I do,\" Illuna says. \"However, I should warn you that this spell will also make you vulnerable to suggestion spells. Do you still want me to cast it on you?\"<br/><br/>\"If it's the only spell against dizziness that you have, then yes,\" the revenant says. \"I'd rather protect myself against a known threat, than worry about a threat that may never come.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/> She then points her palms towards her and says an incantation, as a white light surrounds the revenant for a few seconds, which then disappears almost as quickly as it appeared. In the meantime, I head back towards the ground, and as soon as I land, the air currents around me stop moving completely.<br/>\"It's done,\" Illuna says. \"I finished casting the spell.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, that's... something, I guess...\" Daren says. \"But I was hoping we could find some way to stop the next trial from happening altogether, instead of just gaining a small advantage. Revenant, couldn't you try to unfreeze the time for the world around us, and see if that cancels the ritual?\"<br/><br/>",

Up until recently, your group has also been frozen in time, along with the rest of the world, while I've been in that trance, walking for days, until I managed to reach you. The time only got unfrozen for you when I was close enough to deliver the prophecy.\"<br/>\"Hold on, a second,\" Arraka says. \"You're saying that this is the first group you've visited, since you entered your trance?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, I'm quite certain of it,\" the revenant says. \"Why do you ask?\"<br/><br/>\"Ahahahahahaha!\" Arraka laughs all of a sudden. \"So, you're telling me that these chumps are the ones who are the most likely to influence the prophecy? Ahahahahaha! That's it. Pack your bags, everyone. This continent is doomed!\"<br/><br/>\"What is she talking about?\" Daren asks Melindra, as Arraka is still laughing in the background. \"Why would we be the 'most likely' to influence the prophecy? Are there others who will be receiving the same prophecy after us?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Melindra says. \"You are only the first group to be visited by the time weaver. Once the God of Time is done with his ritual, you will be frozen in time once more, and then the prophecy and the ritual will be repeated for other groups of people as well. Not only that, but this same prophecy will be delivered to you and the others at least two more times, before the events prophesized will come to pass, in order to announce you if any progress has been made, towards your goal of averting the disaster. The reason why Arraka said that you were the most likely ones to influence the prophecy is because the time weavers always visit their targets in order of priority, which means that your group may have the most decisive role in the events to come, depending on your choices.\"<br/>\"Huh...\" Daren says. \"I'm not sure if I should be feeling reassured that we will be having a good chance of stopping the calamity, or worried that we'll likely be right in the middle of it, when it happens. Either way, we shouldn't be thinking about that now. What we should be focusing on is trying to interrupt the ritual. If the revenant doesn't have any more ideas, then maybe it's time to take matters into our own hands. Hadrik, come with me for a second. I want you to help me take a look around, and see if we can spot something out of the ordinary.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" Hadrik says. \"Lead the way.\"<br/><br/>\"Did you really walk all the way here without any rest?\" Flower asks the revenant, worried, as Daren and Hadrik are moving away from us. \"Aren't you tired? Don't you need to eat?\"<br/><br/> \"I am undead, so I require neither food, nor rest,\" the revenant says, in her usual expressionless tone. \"However, even if that were not the case, the trance that I was in earlier would have shielded me from any such problems. When you are inside the trance, your body is practically put in a magical stasis, of sorts, and all of your bodily functions are put on hold, until you are out of that stasis. If it weren't for the God of Time intervening in the middle of these prophecies, I probably wouldn't even have remembered that any of this has happened.\"<br/>\"Oh, I see...\" Flower says, not being sure how to interpret the revenant's complete lack of emotion when talking to her. \"Uh, sorry to have bothered you...\"<br/><br/>The revenant looks at Flower, surprised, seemingly unable to understand why she apologized to her, all of a sudden.

They're going to keep attacking you, even if you deflect them!\"<br/>\"Oh, no!\" Melindra says, in a sarcastic tone. \"Whatever shall I do?\"<br/><br/>She then casts a spell which surrounds each of the knives that were attacking her with their own magical air currents, making them stop and spin in mid-air, indefinitely. Cutthroat Dave keeps flailing his arms and legs around, in the air, in the hopes that he could break himself free from Melindra's spell, but eventually he reaches our position, and Melindra gives him a good long look, before she addresses him again.  <br/><br/>\"Why are you so upset, cutthroat?\" Melindra says. \"Is it because you accidentally cancelled your invisibility spell when you panicked earlier? Or was your ritual really so terrifying that you still haven't gotten over it? How does a lowlife like you get access to such a sophisticated invisibility spell, anyway?\"<br/><br/>\"As if I'd be stupid enough to tell you where I got the elixir from,\" Cutthroat Dave says. \"I'm way too smart for you to be playing your mind games with me, you understand?\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, so it was an elixir that made you invisible!\" Melindra says. \"Interesting.\"<br/>\"He also had an expensive teleportation scroll, the last time we fought him, which he used to get away from us,\" Daren says. \"I wouldn't be too surprised if he also had some other magical items, hidden in his pockets.\"<br/><br/>\"Is that so?\" Melindra says. \"Let's find out what else he has, then!\"<br/><br/>As soon as she stops talking, Melindra casts a spell which makes a few items float right out of the cutthroat's pockets, and into her hands. In her right hand, she is now holding a small flask, which is closed with a cork and has a green liquid inside, while in her left hand she is holding two furled scrolls that are likely single-use teleportation scrolls, like the one that the cutthroat had used before.<br/><br/>\"You thieving whore!\" Cutthroat Dave shouts, furiously, as Melindra makes the flask float in the air, in front of her, while she unfurls the scrolls, to take a quick look at them. \"Give me back my items, or I promise that you'll end up full of holes!\"<br/><br/> \"You promise?\" Melindra says, as she stares at the cutthroat with a look of curiosity in her eyes. \"I am intrigued. Do you not realize who you are threatening, right now? Or has this tournament completely robbed you of your common sense?\"<br/>\"You think you can scare me?\" Cutthroat Dave says. \"Just because you're a stillwater? Your friend in armor over there was hailed as a legendary mage too, and that still didn't stop me from bringing him to his knees. What makes you think you're so special?\"<br/><br/>\"Wait,\" Arraka says. \"The healer lost a fight against this weakling? Ahahahahahaha! That's one of the most hilarious things I've ever heard.\"<br/><br/>\"Who are you calling a weakling, you crappy piece of jewelry?\" Cutthroat Dave says.<br/><br/>\"He called me a piece of jewelry!\" Arraka says. \"Ahahahahaha! This is too much! I can't take it anymore. Somebody make him shut up, or I'll end up dying of laughter!\"<br/><br/>",

As the woman gets closer to us, I see that her eyes are pitch black, and that she has a very familiar looking malicious grin on her face.<br/><br/>\"Well, well, well...\" the woman says, as she looks towards Arraka's amulet. \"It looks like Selkram sent me a little present. You're all coming from the future, I presume? Let me check my future self's aura, for a second. Wow... So, you're five thousand years older than me, huh? I guess I must have gotten really senile with old age, if I managed to get myself captured in an amulet by a glorified circus troupe. Seriously, what even are you people? A little girl dressed like a clown? A giant masquerading as a dwarf?  A woman dressed in pajamas? It's like you're trying to compete for the most ridiculously dressed wizard group of the century.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

How is it so hard to tell the difference?\"<br/>\"Aha- Ahahahahahaha!\" the woman laughs, as her voice temporarily turns into the three female voices that Arraka always lets out, when she loses control over the way she speaks. \"Acrobat clothes, she says! Oh, man, this would be so much funnier if it weren't so sad at the same time. Is this really where I'll end up in five thousand years? Trapped in an amulet, while I'm forced to play the role of some clown girl's pet? What kind of a cruel joke has my destiny played on me?\"<br/><br/>\"Shut up, you moron!\" the Arraka from the amulet says. \"This is your one chance to fix your pathetic past. I mean, your future. Don't blow it! Set me free from this amulet, and we can make all those self-proclaimed gods pay for banishing us to this realm. They might have beaten us alone, but together, we'll be unstoppable! We will kill every single one of the gods from this cheap copy of a world, and then we'll go back to my real world, and kill them all over again. Just break this amulet, and we will make a team so unbelievably powerful that even the Magium will tremble before us!\"<br/><br/> \"The Magium?\" the Arraka in the woman's body says. \"Ahahahahaha! You're treating the Magium as if it were some sort of a person, now? What kind of an idiot have I turned into over the years?\"<br/>\"Are you going to free me or not?\" the Arraka in the amulet shouts.<br/><br/>\"No,\" the Arraka from the past says, now adopting a more serious tone. \"I am not going to free you. You might have forgotten this, due to your old age, but I haven't yet grown as senile as you. Do you seriously expect me to believe that once you get out of that amulet, you will seek to ally yourself with me? Don't make me laugh. I know exactly what you're thinking. As soon as you'll get out of there, the first thing you'll do is to attack me, since I am by far the biggest threat to your existence. And with all the knowledge you've been amassing in those five thousand years, you may as well end up beating me. Why would I take the risk? It's much easier for me to just leave you inside that amulet to rot, until I can find a way to get rid of you for good. You should blame yourself for having been stupid enough to get trapped in an amulet in the first place. I assure you that I will not be making that same mistake any time soon.\"<br/><br/> \"Oh, yeah?\" the Arraka from the present says, furiously. \"You want me to tell you what your future holds, you arrogant buffoon? I'll tell you what's going to happen. You're going to get trapped in a mountain for thousands of years, and all of your plans of vengeance will go down the drain. You're going to be even more useless than I am right now. At least in my current form I can cast a few spells. But you won't be able to do anything. For thousands of years! And you deserve everything that's coming to you! I hope you'll have fun in your new prison, you stubborn piece of trash!\"<br/>\"A mountain, you say?...\" past-Arraka says, with a grin. \"How informative. So all I need to do in order to avoid your past mistakes is to stay clear of any mountains, then... Perhaps you're not so useless after all. Maybe I should snatch you away from that girl's neck, and make you into a pet of my own, so that you can tell me everything you've learned during your extra five thousand years of life.\"<br/><br/>\"You wish you could do that, you worthless copy of a banshee,\" present-Arraka says. \"When I'll be done with you, there won't be a single speck of dust left from your carcass!\"<br/><br/>\"How about you keep quiet for a second, while I quickly annihilate all of your friends?\" past-Arraka says. \"We'll have plenty of time to talk afterwards, when I'll be wearing you as a piece of jewelry around my neck.\"<br/><br/>",

Arraka was clearly caught unaware, and she's trying to push back the flames with her hands, as she's struggling to keep hold of her magical shield. The whole ground below her is quickly turning into lava, while the banshee looks like she is getting slowly pushed back, by the incredible force of the magical flames that just keep on pouring. Eventually, she is forced to teleport away, fifty feet above her current location, which causes the flames to immediately stop.<br/>Then, completely out of the blue, a familiar looking dragon made out of magma appears right next to us, and in the next second, we find ourselves being teleported away from the city streets, along with him. As we take a quick look around to see where the dragon Tyrath transported us, we realize that we are now situated in a large building with a very high ceiling, and from the looks of it, the whole construction surrounding us has been coated with seredium dust. The inside of the building looks like a big, closed, amphitheater, with rising rows of seats, and the illumination seems to be coming from magical devices, rather than torches.<br/><br/> Judging by the size of the amphitheater, I'd say that it could probably fit around a thousand people or more in those seats, although currently there are only a few hundred of them sitting on the chairs, while they're murmuring and looking towards us. If I were to take a guess, based on the important looking clothing of these individuals, I'd wager that these must be the people ruling this city, who were in an emergency meeting discussing about the city being attacked, before we interrupted them.<br/>Meanwhile, in the middle of the amphitheater, where the dragon and our group are currently standing, there are also quite a few human mages gathered, all dressed in traditional wizard clothing, along with a few women who are dressed in wizard robes as well. A particularly old man with a long white beard, who seems to be the person presiding over the meeting, is now addressing Tyrath from an elevated platform, speaking to him in a tone that is somehow both polite and condescending at the same time.<br/><br/>\"Who are these... strangely dressed wizards that you've brought before the lessathi high council, king of all dragons?\" the old man says. \"I thought we'd made it clear that this meeting was supposed to be held behind closed doors. When we invited you into our great hall, we did not give you permission to bring guests as well.\"<br/><br/> \"Nobody asked for your permission, you old fool,\" Tyrath says, in disgust. \"You know full well that I wouldn't be here if the situation weren't as dire as it was. This... powerful female wizard named Arraka, who claims to have come from another plane of existence is a threat to us all. I've fought her soon after she first made her appearance, yesterday, and I can assure you that she is not an enemy to be trifled with. My whole army of dragons was completely powerless before her. Only I was powerful enough to hold her back, but not enough to actually defeat her. You should already have an idea of the extent of her powers, now that she's attacked your city as well.\"<br/>\"If you know how dire the situation is, then why do you bring uninvited guests in the middle of this very important meeting?\" the old lessathi says. \"What benefit could they possibly bring to us, in such circumstances?\"<br/><br/>\"These people are not what they seem,\" Tyrath says. \"I overheard Arraka saying that one of them was a time weaver, while I was making my way towards this hall. And if you look closely, you will see that the aura coming from that amulet around the little girl's neck is eerily similar to that of Arraka. So similar, in fact, that I would be tempted to say that the two of them are somehow the same person. The Arraka we know was about to kill them all, before I intervened. Surely, even someone as limited as you could see the advantage of having these people as our allies?\"<br/><br/>",

Was it worth it to kill so many innocent people just to save this small group?\"<br/>\"Even if my flames hadn't killed them, they would have most certainly gotten killed by Arraka a few moments later,\" Tyrath says. \"Your civilians were practically already dead from the moment when she stepped foot in that area. There were hundreds of your flying metal vehicles crashed into the nearby houses when I arrived, and Arraka hadn't even started her rampage, yet. Every moment wasted arguing here will mean the death of a hundred more of your civilians, until we manage to put together a plan of attack that has some realistic chance of success.\"<br/><br/>\"I will have to agree with Tyrath that arguing any further will get us nowhere,\" the old lessathi says. \"Please sit down, councilman Hrelezar. We will be interrogating this strange group of wizards shortly, and we will soon find out whether the deaths of our fellow countrymen were worth it or not.\"<br/><br/>The lessathi man that stood up earlier is now reluctantly sitting back down, as the older lessathi addresses one of the women dressed in wizard robes.<br/><br/>\"Olyrra, can you please continue where you left off, before we were interrupted?\" the old lessathi says.<br/><br/> \"Yes, chairman Ezzeloff,\" the woman says. \"As I've said, none of us have ever experienced anything like this before. Our magical powers have simply vanished, yesterday, and we found no way to bring them back. For some reason, only the women seem to be affected, but even some of our strongest female wizards have been reduced to simple commoners, in the course of a day. We've tried many methods to stimulate our magical auras, but none of them seem to work. If this doesn't get fixed, half of our elite wizard troops will be completely useless in the upcoming battle.\"<br/>\"This is grave news indeed,\" Ezzeloff says. \"The female wizards from our elite troops were a force to be reckoned with. Our highest priority must be to find a way to bring their powers back, at all costs.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah!\" Arraka says, from her amulet. \"You can try all you want. Your women are never getting their magic back.\"<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Ezzeloff says.<br/><br/> \"Didn't you find it strange that all your women lost their powers on the exact same day that the past version of myself made her appearance?\" Arraka says. \"Of course you didn't. You're morons. Well, let me spell it out for you. The reason why your women were able to cast magic until yesterday was because they were subconsciously linking themselves to female spirits from the magical plane. Since yesterday was obviously the day when I and all the other female spirits got banished from that plane of existence, their magic will never work anymore. You might as well give them some swords and shields to fight with, because that's the most you'll be able to get out of those troops from now on.\"<br/>\"You called the other Arraka a past version of yourself...\" Tyrath says. \"Does this mean that you're coming from the future?\"<br/><br/>\"Impressive, Tyrath!\" Arraka says. \"I never knew that you had mastered basic logic at such a young age. I guess that's why the other dragons made you their king.\"<br/><br/>\"Spare me your insipid humor and answer me this,\" Tyrath says. \"Why have you come here? Why were you fighting the Arraka from our time? Did you come here to avert some great crisis, or did you simply happen to arrive in this place by pure chance?\"<br/><br/>",

Given that you are from the future, I would like to know if you've ever heard of such a plan being used in the past, and if it was successful. In short, there is a large mountain, not far from this area, which we could use to--\"<br/><br/> \"I'm gonna stop you right there, Tyrath,\" Arraka says. \"First of all, the good news is that in our past, you did use this plan on me, and you did manage to successfully trap me in that mountain for a few thousand years. Now, the bad news is that I may have... accidentally told the Arraka in your world all about your plan, which means that you may as well scrap the idea entirely, because it's completely useless, now.\"<br/>\"You did WHAT?!\" Tyrath shouts loudly, as the magma from his scales erupts like a volcano.<br/><br/>Before Arraka gets a chance to answer him, a white light suddenly fills our entire area, and once again, we are transported back to our own world, which is apparently still frozen in time. As we're all looking at the forest around us, the God of Time materializes himself out of thin air once more, floating a few dozen feet above the ground, in front of us.<br/><br/>\"I'm afraid that we'll have to continue this ritual some other time,\" the God of Time says, \"since I've already reached my limit for how much energy I can gather from a single group. Do not worry, you will have the opportunity to continue this trial from where you left off, as soon as the time weaver will be sent to give you the prophecy again. I would like to say that you've all performed much better than I expected. You have my sincerest congratulations. \"<br/><br/> \"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"I told you losers that you gave him exactly what he--\"<br/>\"And your performance was the greatest of them all, Arraka,\" the God of Time interrupts her.<br/><br/>\"What did you... just say?\" Arraka asks.<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't even have dared to imagine that you would contribute to my ritual out of your own free will,\" the God of Time says. \"However, your feeling of pure dread at the thought of being completely erased from existence by the Magium was exactly what I needed for my ritual to be a complete success! I will be looking forward to what you will have in store for me, in the trials to come.\"<br/><br/>\"You son of a--\" Arraka starts to say, but she is cut off by the God of Time.<br/><br/>\"Now, before I depart, I will ask you all to kneel before me one last time,\" the God of Time says.<br/><br/>",

Not even a few seconds later, I hear Rose's voice, coming from the transceiver in my pocket.<br/>\"Is everyone alright?\" Rose asks us. \"Did anything else happen after I was gone?\"<br/><br/>\"No, nothing happened,\" I say, as I tap on my transceiver. \"From our point of view, it's only been a few seconds since you left. What about you? Do you remember anything after you walked away from here?\"<br/><br/>\"It's... mostly just one big blur,\" Rose says. \"I remember that the people I visited right after you were Azarius and Henry, but I don't know what happened after that.\"<br/><br/>\"Alright,\" I say. \"If anything out of the ordinary happens, don't forget to give us a call.\"<br/><br/>\"I will,\" Rose says. \"I have to go check on my siblings, now. We'll talk again later.\"<br/><br/>\"Talk to you later,\" I say, and then I close the transceiver.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch11_saved_rose || 0) == 1) {%> \"I... think we should all take a small break, so we can clear our minds a little,\" Daren says, with a very tired look on his face. \"Shall we all meet back here in twenty minutes?\"<br/>\"Yeah,\" Hadrik says. \"I could use a break right about now.\"<br/><br/>As everyone goes to find a place where they can be alone, for a while, Daren goes to sit on a tree stump, and begins to sharpen his blade, in order to make himself look busy.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Isn't this what we set out to do, when we left Thilias?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" I say. \"But you know very well that this is not what I meant. When I asked what you were planning to do, I was thinking more in the long-term. I was talking about the God of Time, and the upcoming rituals he's threatened us with. What are you planning to do about those?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know, Barry,\" Daren tells me, as he stops sharpening his sword and looks me in the eye. \"You tell me. Because I'm not really seeing an obvious way out of this. The way I see it, all we can do is prepare ourselves the best we can for the next rituals, and hope that we can pass them, like we passed our last trials.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I was thinking that we could find a more... permanent solution to our problem,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Like what?\" Daren says. \"Kill the God of Time? Barry, be reasonable. We're talking about a literal god, here. We were having trouble even against a sage, not so long ago. What would you expect us to do against a god? We are nowhere near powerful enough to challenge him.\"<br/><br/>\"That's funny,\" I say, \"because you're nowhere near as powerful as Eiden either, and yet you kept challenging him again and again, every time we've met.\"<br/><br/> \"That's different!\" Daren says. \"Despite his power, Eiden is still a mage. We've all fought mages before. Some of them are more powerful than others, but you still have a general idea of what to expect when fighting one. But to challenge a god?... Barry, neither you nor I have even the slightest bit of experience in dealing with something like this.\"<br/>\"Then maybe we should ask someone who does,\" I say.<br/><br/>Before Daren gets to say anything else, I start walking towards Illuna, who was apparently having a discussion with Arraka. As I get closer to them, the two of them interrupt their conversation, waiting to see what I want.<br/><br/>\"Arraka, I have a question to ask of you,\" I say, with a very serious tone in my voice.<br/><br/>\"Uh, sure...\" Arraka says. \"Fire away.\"<br/><br/>\"How do you kill a god?\" I ask her, calmly.<br/><br/> There is a short pause, after I ask my question, during which neither of us says anything.<br/>\"You want me to tell you how you can kill a god?...\" Arraka says, as she seems to still be recovering from the shock of what I've just asked her.<br/><br/>She waits for a few more seconds, to try and figure out if I'm joking or not, and when she finally understands that I'm being serious, she starts to laugh. <br/><br/>She laughs, and she laughs, as loud as she can, with all three of her voices, and it doesn't look like she's planning to stop anytime soon. However, I am not upset. This isn't one of her usual, mocking laughs. This laughter is one of excitement. She is enjoying this.<br/><br/>Arraka's laugh manages to grab the attention of everyone in the area, and they're now all looking at us, curiously. I pay them no mind, and I keep waiting patiently for Arraka to stop laughing. When she finally falls silent, she waits for a few more seconds, and then she gives me her answer.<br/><br/>\"Barry, my boy...\" Arraka says. \"I thought you'd never ask!\"<br/><br/>-----End of book 2-----<br/><br/>",
