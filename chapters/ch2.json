We see a slim, tall figure standing behind us, with long black hair, fair skin, and a very serious look on her face. She is wearing leather pants, a long sleeved white blouse, and a green, hooded cloak. She appears to be somewhere in her early twenties. <br/><br/>But that's not all there is to this woman. I can also sense a strong magical aura all around her. An aura that couldn't possibly be coming from a regular human. Could she be... a banshee?<br/><br/>My heart starts beating rapidly again. That night from fifteen years ago is coming back to me. I can see it vividly, and I can still hear the laughter. That sinister, high-pitched laughter. Will it never stop haunting me?<br/><br/>I breathe in deeply, and try to calm down. This woman can't be a banshee. The feeling I'm getting now is too different from the one I got back then. Does that mean she's a mage? No, that would be impossible. And yet... <br/><br/>\"Barry,\" whispers Daren. \"Don't be afraid. I know white magic. I can purify her.\"<br/><br/>I realize Daren must have also sensed the magic coming from the woman and concluded that she's been possessed by a banshee. Banshees are parasitic spirits that need to inhabit bodies in order to survive. They usually spend a few weeks inside a body in a dormant state before taking over. During this phase, the host may develop magical powers. Once a banshee is in full control of the body, they say she has awakened. The only way you can save the original host once she's been possessed by a banshee is to use white magic to purify her before the banshee has fully awakened, which basically means killing the banshee without harming the host.<br/>However, the purification technique operates on the assumption that a woman cannot have magic powers of her own. They call it purification, but all the technique does in fact is to completely eradicate the aura that gives off the strong magical vibe, with the purpose of also eliminating the banshee along with it. On the other hand, if the aura does not in fact belong to a banshee, but to the woman herself, the purification would be nothing short of a death sentence. <br/><br/>\"No, wait. Listen to me!\" I blurt out. \"This woman isn't a banshee.\"<br/><br/>\"So what, you're suggesting she's a mage, then? Barry, women can't be mages. There hasn't been a single recorded case of a woman mage in all of our world's history. Every time a woman's developed magical powers, it's been because of a banshee. Every single time.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't you think I know that? But this one is different. If you try to purify her, you may well end up killing her!\"<br/><br/> \"How can you be so sure?\"<br/>\"Because I've met a banshee before. Up close. Have you met a banshee before, Daren?\"<br/><br/>\"...No,\" he admits.<br/><br/>\"You just said you trusted me enough to tell me your greatest weakness. I'm asking you to trust me on this too. Can you trust me on this, Daren?\" <br/><br/>Daren gives me one long look, and then he sighs deeply. <br/><br/>\"Alright. We'll do it your way. But I'm keeping an eye on her. I swear, Barry, if it turns out you're only saying all of this because of her looks, I'm going to--\"<br/><br/>\"Would you guys mind telling me what you've been whispering about for the past minute?\" the woman asks us.<br/><br/>",

That's what most people call these devices nowadays. But very few people know what they really do, and how they actually work. My research has led me to believe that these devices harness their energy from the magic all around them. The more energy they harness, the more effective they become. Since mages are usually spread far apart from one another and they don't really have any reason to cast powerful spells one after the other, the effects of such a device are mostly negligible.<br/><br/>But imagine the amount of energy it could gather in a place filled with the most powerful mages in the world, who are constantly fighting each other. <br/><br/>I pull the device out of my pocket. It looks much like a toy, with a few buttons and a screen. As I press the buttons, different letters magically appear on the screen, forming words, and showing me numbers. The device calls these my 'stats'. My stats consist mostly of various physical attributes such as strength, speed, reflexes, toughness, observation and hearing, but there's also others like combat technique, ancient languages and premonition. <br/><br/>When the device harnesses enough energy, it announces me by beeping, and it then allows me to invest a limited number of points in my stats. At the moment, all of my stats are at zero, which means that the device's energy was completely depleted when I bought it. I guess I'll have to start leveling them from scratch.<br/>Investing my points in stats is supposed to actually enhance my real attributes, as long as I keep the device close enough to me that it comes into contact with my magical aura. As I spend my time here, I'm expecting to hear these beeps more and more often. I'll have to think twice about the way I spend my points though, since I have no way of knowing when I'll get my next batch of points, and no way to change my mind after I've invested them. The maximum values that appear now for each stat are likely to increase as time passes.<br/><br/>This device is mostly used by fortune tellers because of its premonition stat. It provides them with some very vague glimpses into the future that they are then free to interpret to their own liking.  I wonder if the ancient languages stat actually means that I'll start being able to understand and speak ancient tongues. I heard there are many such writings on this continent.

Since the younger mage seems to be focused on me, I'll lure him away from Daren and try to fight him on my own until Daren finishes off the older mage. <br/>Kate seems to have gotten the sword throwing mage's undivided attention. He is constantly sending swords her way from every direction, as she creates walls of ice to block his attacks. We're lucky. With Daren's weakness against weapons and my lack of magical talents, that mage would probably have been the hardest for us to fight.<br/><br/>As the bearded mage reaches us, his battleaxe clashes loudly with Daren's sword.<br/><br/>\"I see you've enchanted your weapon well, healer,\" says the older mage. \"But how long can you last against a battle-hardened warrior such as myself?\"<br/><br/>He roars, and presses his battleaxe harder against Daren's sword.<br/><br/>As the two of them fight, I dash away towards the forest. As expected, the mage with the dagger is coming right after me.<br/>\"Barry, wait!\" Daren shouts after me. <br/><br/>He attempts to follow, but decides against it. He can't afford to avert his eyes from the bearded mage even for a second. He is too dangerous.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the mage fighting Kate has managed to surround her with floating swords, aimed at her from every direction. He sends them all at her simultaneously in an attempt to overwhelm her defenses. She quickly surrounds herself with a sphere of very thick ice, and all of the swords, once again stop into it. As she dismisses the sphere, all the hundreds of swords drop to the ground, with a deafening clang.<br/><br/>",

The mage tries to surprise me again by teleporting behind me, but I manage to stop his arm as he flings it towards me. Keeping a firm hold of his arm, I pull back his wrist, forcing him to let go of the dagger. As I take his weapon, he quickly pulls out another dagger from his sleeve, and makes a lunge towards me.

She is throwing ice cones towards the other young mage, and he is now forced to use his swords to cut them down, instead of attacking her. As he focuses more on defense, Kate's attacks become more and more relentless. It doesn't take her long until she starts sending hundreds of ice daggers towards her enemy. The mage doesn't seem to know how to use his technique to defend from such a large number of simultaneous attacks.

A cone of ice comes slowly out of her palm, with its sharp end aimed towards the mage's head. <br/><br/>Everything that followed happened almost in an instant. She sent the cone of ice flying straight into the young mage's head, killing him instantly. The older mage's shock of seeing his son die in front of him provided enough of an opening for Daren to cut his head right off his shoulders. As the sword throwing mage was still recovering from what he'd just seen happen, Kate took one of the many swords lying at her feet, and quickly sent it flying back towards its owner, impaling him through the heart and killing him on the spot.<br/><br/>It was a gruesome show, but at this point, all I care about is that I somehow managed to make it out of that alive. <br/><br/>",

The Magium.<br/><br/>Nobody knows exactly what it looks like, or what it's made of, but everyone knows the fact that it is the source of all magic in the world, and that it can only be found on the continent of Varathia. All mages seek it. They crave it. They are certain that if they have access to it, they can increase their powers a hundredfold and become living legends. And although it is a common misconception that the Magium is only useful for learned mages, my studies have led me to believe that the Magium is so extraordinary that it can even turn a normal human into a mage.<br/><br/>I've searched very long for a way to get into Varathia, but the only way one can travel to their continent is by receiving a direct invitation. Very few of those are sent yearly, and the people being teleported there are being held under direct supervision for the duration of their stay, and return with no information regarding the coordinates of the place.<br/>But when all hope seemed lost, the announcement came. A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   <br/><br/>I knew then that there would never be another chance like this. <br/><br/>\"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?\" Daren asks me again.<br/><br/>",
