"Barry!" I hear Daren's voice calling out to me. "Hey, Barry, can you hear me?"

I wake up with a slight headache and my vision blurry. As I start to see clearer, I notice that I am sitting in the middle of a room with stone walls and no windows, with the only visible exit being a metal bar door which seems to be locked shut. The stones used to build the walls look very old, are full of cracks, and there's moss growing all over them. If I were to guess, I'd say we are being held in the prison cell of some old ruins. I suddenly remember Kate's friend, and how she left us all unconscious in the middle of the forest. Is she the one that brought us here?

I look around me to see if everyone's here. Daren is standing right beside me, while Kate and Rose are sitting on the floor on the opposite side of the room, with their backs leaned against the wall. Hadrik is standing near the metal bar door and knocking lightly on the walls around it, likely in an attempt to test their durability.

"What happened?" I ask Daren. "Did the lessathi bring us here?"

 "No, it wasn't the lessathi," Daren says. "It was the animals from the forest. They seemed really upset that we trespassed on their sacred magical fairy lands. I'll gladly bring you up to speed with everything that happened while you were passed out, but first, can you PLEASE shut off that infernal device of yours? It's been beeping ever since I woke up, and it's really starting to get on my nerves."
I take out my stats device and see that I received four more points while I was unconscious. It must have picked up some energy from the air after yesterday's fights.

 Once I'm done with the stat booster, I put it back in my pocket and the device stops beeping.
"Finally!" Daren says. "At least now we can get some peace and quiet while we try to think of a way out of here."

"Wait," I tell him. "You said that some animals brought us here, but I don't see anyone guarding our cell. Did they come by here while I was still unconscious?"

"Yeah," says Daren. "A tiger and a bear came by earlier and started growling at us. At first, I thought the jailers sent their pets here to scare us, but then Kate and Rose started talking to them, by making weird animal noises. It turns out that all of the animals and monsters on this continent can speak, but they only use ancient languages. Monsters can't speak in the common tongue because they don't know any better, and the animals aren't allowed to speak it because their spirit fox leader has forbidden its use after the humans started hunting them for food. It also turns out that having a basic understanding of ancient languages is not so uncommon if you were born on this continent."

"Never mind all that," I tell Daren. "Did they say what they want from us?"

"Yeah, they said that we should wait here until their great golden fox arrives, and they apparently kept making jokes about how she will teach us all a lesson."

"So, why aren't they guarding us, then? What's to stop us from just breaking through the walls and escaping?"

"These," Daren says, as he points at his neck.

 For the first time, I notice that we are all wearing green collars around our necks, with strange markings written on them. I turn to Kate.
"Wait, are these--" I start to ask her but she cuts me off.

"Yes," she answers me. "They're the same type of collars that the ancients used on artificial mages at the Beacon of Hope in order to keep their powers under control. The good news is that I know how to turn them off. The bad news is that we need to find the device that's powering all of these collars, before I can use it to deactivate them. These ruins were also built by the lessathi of old, so if they are anything like the Beacon, then there should be a control room not far from here."

"But if none of you can cast spells, then why is Hadrik still in his dwarf form?"

"Yeah, I was wondering about that too," Hadrik says. "I guess the collars don't actually dispel any spell that you cast on yourself before wearing them. They just prevent you from casting any more magic. The first thing I tried when I woke up was to turn into a giant, but this damn collar won't let me cast any sort of shapeshifting magic."

"You say that you can't cast any magic..." I tell him. "But you still have your superhuman strength, right?"

 "Aye!" Hadrik says, grinning. "But even with my power, I still can't smash the collar around my neck. These blasted contraptions seem to be near indestructible. Now I was checking to see if the walls are as durable as the collars, but it looks like they're just made up of regular stones. I should be able to break through them without any problem!"

TEXT: 

 "Wait, I think we should try to talk things through with their leader, first."
"Sounds like a good plan," says Daren, with a sarcastic tone. "I mean, for all we know, this may well just be some cultural misunderstanding, and they only want to offer us a cup of tea."

"Damn it, Daren, you know very well that this isn't what I was--"

"Alright, everyone!" Daren shouts loudly, to cover up the sound of my voice. "It's time for a vote! Barry says that we should all stay here and eat cupcakes with the queen of magical fairy land. I say we should make a run for it now, while there's no one guarding our cell. Whoever also thinks that escaping now would be our best course of action, please raise your hand!"

All four of them raise their hands simultaneously. Daren and Hadrik are both grinning at me, while Kate is looking away, and Rose is smiling apologetically.

"Sorry, Barry!" she says.

"Well," Daren continues, "since we're running a democracy here, I'm afraid that you were two votes short of a victory, Barry. It's too bad, the results were pretty close! Hadrik, whenever you're ready."

"Aye!" the dwarf says, preparing to punch a hole in the wall.

"Stop!" I say, and Hadrik interrupts his swing to look at me.

 "Oh, for crying out loud, what is it this time?" Daren asks.
"What if this is all a trap?" I say. "Don't you find it strange that there isn't even a single guard watching our cell? What if they're baiting us to escape, so that they can capture us again on more severe charges? Right now, the only thing we're guilty of is temporarily trespassing on their territory. Given that we are outsiders and do not know these lands very well, we should have extenuating circumstances. But if we try to escape now, we'll most surely have to fight some of the animals, and we might even be forced to kill some of them. Do we really want to make enemies of an entire race just because of a small misunderstanding?"

"Hmm..." Hadrik says thoughtfully, while stroking his beard. "The lad does have a point."

"You can't be serious!" Daren tells him.

"Rose," I continue, "didn't you tell us that this spirit fox of theirs is like some kind of god? Isn't she like, crazy strong?"

"Oh, yes," Rose says. "She is thousands of years old and likely dwarfs the power of most mages from this tournament."

"So, would you choose to make her into our enemy right off the bat, knowing that there might be a small chance to talk things through with her if we just have a little patience?"

"Well, when you put it like that, I suppose I wouldn't!" Rose says, smiling.

 "Oh, come on!" Daren says, exasperated. "You were all on my side a few moments ago!"
"What's the matter, Daren?" I ask him, with a smirk. "Don't you like democracy anymore?"

Daren frowns at me, but he eventually gives up and decides to drop his stance on the subject.

"Fine!" he says. "I see that you've all made up your minds already, so there's no use in dragging this matter on any further. We'll have a talk with this great golden fox and see where we go from there."

It doesn't take long for the animals' leader to make her appearance. Her shape is that of a normal fox, but her fur is so bright that it looks like it's made of actual gold. The magical aura that she emanates is rather intimidating, and it also gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?

The fox is being accompanied by a leopard and a bull, one on her left side and one on her right, just like two bodyguards walking alongside some rich noble kid. When they all stop in front of our cell, the fox starts speaking to us, in the common tongue.

 "Greetings, outsiders," she says. "I am Eleya, the golden fox, and these are my two trusted lieutenants, Leo the leopard and Taurus the bull."
"Leo and Taurus!" Daren says, in a low voice. "Name creativity at its best!"

"Shouldn't Leo be a lion's name, though?" Hadrik asks him.

"Shhhh!" Rose tells them, looking frantically at the three animals to see if any of them heard their banter.

The bull seems to have both heard and understood Daren's jest, as he is now looking straight at him, with a furious look in his eyes. The leopard either didn't hear his remark, or didn't deem it worthy of a reaction on his part. The fox simply ignores them altogether, and continues her speech, as if nothing had happened.

"My loyal subjects informed me that you were caught trespassing on our sacred grounds. What do you have to say in your defense?"

 "We didn't know that we were on sacred grounds."
"That is your defense?" the fox asks me, baffled. "In what way does ignorance absolve you of your transgression? Do you deny having trespassed on our sacred grounds?"

"No, but--"

"Then I hereby find you guilty, and sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in our animal kingdom. May your years spent here make you reflect upon what you've done, and repent for your crimes."

"Now, wait just one second!" Daren says. "What kind of a nonsensical sentence is this? Who sentences someone to a life of labor like that just because they happened to walk into a forbidden area by accident? Do you also execute your fawns and cubs if they don't keep off the grass in a park?"

 "You would be wise to not address me in such a casual manner, mage in armor," Eleya says. "But to answer your question, the animal kingdom has neither parks, nor a rule to keep off the grass in any region of the continent. However, if there were such a rule, and a cub or a fawn were to break it, then I assure you I would not hesitate in ordering their execution. Rules are meant to be upheld, both by humans and by animals. The fact that you humans are so lenient with your rules is one of the main reasons why your society is decaying to such a degree. I will hear no more of this. You will begin your work tomorrow, at the break of dawn. You have until then to prepare yourselves for what is to come."
With these last words, the golden fox leaves, and her bull companion hurries to follow her. The leopard stays behind for a bit and magically conjures a yellow envelope on the floor in front of him, out of thin air. He then uses one of his front paws to push the envelope under the metal bar door, and into our cell. Once he makes sure that he got our attention, he also goes to follow the fox and the bull, without uttering a single word to us.

Rose picks up the envelope from the ground and opens it. Inside, there's a small note that appears to be written in the common language.

"What does it say?" Kate asks her.

"It says: 'If you reach a corridor that splits into three paths, each marked with the symbol of an insect, choose the one marked with a beetle.' "

 "We meant to leave, but we were attacked and left there unconscious."
"So you admit to having waged a battle on our sacred grounds?!" the fox asks me, shocked. "That is a much more heinous crime than having simply trespassed on our territory. A crime that is punishable by death."

"Wait, what?..."

"You will be given twenty-four hours to make peace with your gods and to write your final letters to your families. Your execution will be carried tomorrow, at dawn. Be sure to have everything done by then."

"Now, wait just one second!" Daren says. "What kind of a nonsensical sentence is this? Who sentences someone to death like that just because they happened to be fighting on your territory? Do you also execute your fawns and cubs if they don't keep off the grass in a park?"

 "Hold on," Kate says. "Does this mean that the leopard expects us to escape and is giving us directions?"
"So, Barry," Daren says in a particularly loud voice, even though we're all very close to each other, "what do you figure we should do next? Do you think we should wait until tomorrow and see if the golden fox has a change of heart? Maybe we should hold another vote to decide our best course of action! What do you say, Barry? Should we hold another vote?"

The smug grin he has on his face is getting a little irritating.

"That's enough, Daren," Kate says. "None of us could have known what the fox's intentions were beforehand. They still left no guards to watch over us, so no harm was done. In fact, we may even be in a better position than we were before, judging by the contents of the note that Rose is holding in her hands."

"Aye!" Hadrik says, "We all agreed to hear the fox out before trying to escape. It was a good idea while it lasted!"

Having been left with no other alternative than to break out of our cell, we waited for a few minutes to make sure that the fox and her lieutenants were out of hearing range, and then Hadrik shattered the wall of our prison with his fist.

 As we step over the rubble and take a good look outside of our cell, we see that the corridor we've just entered is completely deserted. If it weren't for a few lit torches here and there, it wouldn't be too far-fetched to assume that this building had been abandoned a long time ago. Our cell seems to have been placed at the far end of the corridor, which means that the only way for us to go is left. 
"I don't like this," says Kate, as we walk down the corridor. "This is the same direction in which the fox and her followers went. The last thing we want is to run into them while we're escaping."

"Well, it's not like we were given much of a choice," Hadrik says. "There was only one way to go after we walked out of our cell, and there haven't been any forks in the road since then. What intrigues me most is that we haven't passed by a single cell since we got out. Isn't this supposed to be a dungeon of some sort? Where are all the other prisoners?"

"Maybe they only have one cell per corridor?" Rose suggests.

"Forget the prisoners," I say. "I'm more worried about the complete lack of guards in this place. Did they seriously think that we couldn't bring down these frail old walls without magic?"

"Hey, Rose," Daren calls out, as he's studying the writing on a wall. "Can you come over here for a second?"

"Certainly!" Rose says, and she heads over to his side.

 "You can read ancient languages, right? Can you tell me what this says?"
"Hmm..." Rose says, as she looks at the text and furrows her eyebrows. "I'm afraid that this is a bit too advanced for me. I can tell that it's written in the language used by the lessathi of old, but I cannot understand any of the words."

"Barry," Daren says, "didn't that trinket of yours have a stat named 'ancient languages'? Come over here and see if you can translate this!"

Suddenly, the stone with the markings on it slides itself to the side, and two small objects get thrown out of the hole it left in the wall. The stone then slides back into its original position. Upon closer inspection, I see that the two objects that came out of the wall are a small parchment and what appears to be a piece of a puzzle. I take them both from the ground, and read the piece of parchment. The text on it is written in the common language this time, and it says: "Find all of the pieces of the puzzle, and I will share with you my greatest secret. I've left one of these in each of the buildings I've designed."

The parchment is then signed as simply: "This building's architect."

"Okay," Daren says, as I put the small parchment and the puzzle piece in my left pocket. "First of all, what did the glyphs say, and secondly, what are those?"

Daren grabs the two objects from the ground and looks at them. It looks like one of the objects is a piece of a puzzle, and the other is a small parchment. Daren reads the parchment, and then he hands both objects to me, while he exclaims in disgust:

"Useless!"

As I read the text on the parchment, I notice that it's written in the common language, and that it says: "Find all of the pieces of the puzzle, and I will share with you my greatest secret. I've left one of these in each of the buildings I've designed."

 The parchment is then signed as simply: "This building's architect."
"I don't know what I was expecting, really," Daren says, as he steps away from the wall and starts to walk down the corridor again. "I mean, it's not like we're--"

Daren stops mid-sentence when he realizes that there is someone blocking his path. There's a little girl standing in front of him, with her hands behind her back and a cheerful smile on her face. She is wearing a golden amulet around her neck, a gray tank top shirt, large pants commonly worn by clowns and no shoes. She is about four feet tall, and her long red hair is almost reaching her waist. Given her height and general appearance, I'd say that she is no older than ten. And yet, I'm not getting any sort of warning to not hurt her. Isn't she one of the locals?

"Hello!" she tells Daren, still smiling.

"What the..." Daren says. "Where did you come from?"

"There!" the girl says, while pointing towards a hole in the ceiling.

"Oh, uh, okay..." says Daren. "And what are you doing here?"

"We were just doing some training in the room above, when we heard you talking below us. My name is Flower. Pleased to meet you!"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hold on, there! Who's 'we'?"

 Flower seems to have been caught off guard by Daren's question.
"Did I say 'we'?" she asks. "I'm sorry, I meant to say 'I'. I was doing some training in the room above. No 'we'. Just 'I'."

 "What do you mean by training?" Kate asks her.
"Oh, lots of stuff!" the girl says. "But mostly, I come here to practice my acrobatic skills. There's all sorts of traps around here, and I try to dodge them while doing fancy backflips or while I'm running on walls. It's really fun!"

"There are traps in these ruins?" Kate asks.

"Yeah, the place is filled with them! You need to watch your step if you're not from around here. Did you all come here for sightseeing?"

"Uh, no..." Kate says. "We were captured by the animals and locked up in a cell. We're currently looking for the control room so we can turn off the collars around our necks. You wouldn't happen to know where that is, would you?"

"Control room?" Flower asks, and she pauses a little to think. "Oh, you mean the room full of levers and buttons! Sure, I know where that is. Follow me, I'll show you the way!"

As she starts walking down the corridor, Daren says to me in a low voice:

 "Maybe she's an animal in disguise."
"No, that can't be right!" Daren says. "Do you really think that any of these animals can cast illusion spells? Unless you're suggesting that she's wearing a costume, of course."

"It doesn't matter who she is," Kate interrupts us. "She clearly knows this place better than us, and if she were working with the animals, she would have already alerted them of our presence. Either way, there's only one path for us to take at this point, so we don't really have much choice than to go after her. We'll decide later if we should trust her or not."

When we catch up with Flower, we hear her start talking with a much colder tone than before. While she speaks, she is still walking down the corridor, and her back is turned to us.

"What's wrong with you, Flower?" she says in her cold voice. "We came to these desolate ruins to train, not to play the tour guide! We don't even know who these people are!"

"Relax, Petal!" the girl says, this time in her previous cheerful tone. "They seem like nice people. We can get back to training once we're done showing them around! This shouldn't take long."

"I'm sorry, who are you talking to?" Kate asks her.

Flower gets startled by Kate's question, and quickly turns around to face her.

"D-did we say that out loud?" she asks. "I mean 'me'! 'Me', not 'we'! Because there's only one of me!"

 "Wait, are you implying that there's more than one of you in there?" Daren asks.
"What? No, that's crazy! You're crazy!"

She then starts laughing very nervously and unnaturally.

"Did she just call me crazy?" Daren asks us.

Suddenly, there's a muffled laughter coming from within the golden amulet that Flower is wearing around her neck. The girl opens up the amulet and starts talking to it.

"Shut up, Arraka!" she says.

Now that I can hear the laughter clearer, I realize that the voice inside the amulet is made up of three different voices, all women, laughing simultaneously. Once the being inside the amulet realizes that we can now hear her clearly, she starts speaking to us.

"Hey, you there!" the voice says. "This girl's a banshee! Quick, check her magical aura! Check her magical au--"

 Flower panics and she closes the amulet, shutting the voice up, but the harm had already been done. As I analyze her magical aura in detail, I realize that it's in fact a lot more powerful than it seems, and that she's willfully suppressing it in order to make it seem like that of a normal human. But is she an actual banshee, or another artificial mage like Kate? There's something off about her aura... I can't tell exactly what. It feels almost as if she has two distinct magical auras around her, one that gives off an outworldly vibe, and one that doesn't. It's as if both the girl and the banshee that possessed her are somehow coexisting in the same body, as two separate entities. But that's impossible... Isn't it?

 "So, that's what she's been hiding from us all this time!" Daren says.
He then turns to the girl.

"Kid, you're in luck!" he says. "You don't need to live in fear any longer. Despite my looks, I just so happen to be an established white mage! I'll rid you of your banshee problem in no time."

"What?" the girl says, shocked. "No, you can't!"

"Of course I can!" Daren says. "Don't worry about the collar. This sword has more than enough enchantments on it to be able to carry out a purification ritual even without me casting any spells. That banshee will be dead before you know it, and you'll be able to live your life as a normal girl again!"

"No!" Flower shouts. "She's my friend! I won't let you hurt her!"

"Friend?..." Daren asks the girl, as he approaches her. "This is even more serious than I thought! I need to get you purified quick. You're not thinking straight anymore!"

 When he gets closer to Flower, one of the stones that he stepped on starts sinking into the floor, and we can hear some other stones moving above our heads.
"Look out!" Flower says, pointing upwards, as a large rock detaches itself from the ceiling and descends upon our heads. 

The girl raises her hand, with her palm facing the big boulder, and she shoots a fireball at it, which pulverizes the rock in an instant. As we are getting showered with rubble from the destroyed boulder, the walls are now slowly starting to close in on us, with a loud and menacing sound echoing all throughout the corridor.

She starts looking all around her for a way out, and then her eyes find the hole in the ceiling that she used to get into our corridor. 

"Okay, I've got an idea!" she says. "I think I may be able to create an enclosed space here by blowing up the roof on both sides of the corridor. I can then flood the room with water so that we can all swim up to that hole in the ceiling!  Can you guys swim?"

"Well, I'm dressed from head to toe in heavy armor, so what do you think?!" Daren asks her.

"Okay, okay! New plan! I think there was a secret mechanism in the room above to stop the walls from moving! Petal, can you give me a boost?"

The girl puts both arms alongside her, with her palms facing downwards. Two powerful jets of water start erupting out of her hands, which lift her into the air, and right through the hole in the ceiling.

"What the hell?" Daren says. "Didn't she use fire magic just a moment ago? Don't tell me that she's already mastered two elements by the age of nine?!"

"Actually, I think that water is the banshee's element," I tell Daren.

 "What did you just say?" he asks me.
"Guys, can you hear me?" Flower asks us from the room above, but she then continues to talk without waiting for an answer. "Just wanted to let you know that I've found the secret mechanism. But, uh... You see, the thing is there's more than just one mechanism. And I don't really know which one of these is the right one. But... I'm sure I'll figure this out in good time. Probably."

"Okay, that's it!" Hadrik says. "I'm going to punch right through this wall until we get to the other side."

"What?!" Kate shouts. "No, don't do that! Are you insane? What if that wall is the only thing holding up the ceiling above us and it will all come crashing down upon us once you destroy it?"

"So you'd rather sit here and get squashed between two walls, then?" Hadrik says. "You're not seriously thinking that the little goofball up there is going to figure out the complex mechanisms that run this place before the walls reach us, do you?"

"Uh, guys?" Flower says. "I don't know if you can hear me, but I just realized that I forgot to tell you one important thing. Whatever you do, DON'T smash the walls. Okay? Good! Now, then, let's see... I think I've got this! Aha!... Okay, no, that was the light switch. Back to the drawing board."

"Uh, no, I think we're all okay, for now," Hadrik says. "Sorry about that, I got a little impatient back there."

"Okay," Flower says. "Then, I guess I should tell you about the bad news now. See, when I was fiddling around with those complex mechanisms upstairs, I... maaay have accidentally activated all of the traps on this corridor."

 The girl starts sprinting down the corridor, and makes a surprisingly long jump, which lands her on a large stone with two cracks on either side of it. She then does an elegant pirouette and turns towards us.
"See?" she tells us. "Everything's under control!"

As soon as she finishes talking, one of the walls opens up and a large pendulum blade comes swinging out of it, aiming directly for Flower. She rolls out of its way, and triggers two more traps by accident. There are now dozens of arrows shooting out of both walls, while sharp spinning blades are coming out of the floor and moving in circles all around her. At first glance, the girl appears to be just clumsily stumbling around while evading the traps out of sheer luck. As I watch her more closely, I realize that even though her movements all seem erratic, they have a way of flowing into one another which allows her to not waste even a single second between two actions. I guess she wasn't kidding when she said that she came to this place to train her acrobatic skills.

Hadrik shakes his head as he watches the girl jump around, and then he lays flat on the floor, with his ear pressing against the ground, trying to listen for something.

"Uh, guys, I know this looks bad," Flower tells us as she jumps off a wall, lands on her left hand and then bounces off the floor like a spring, "but if I keep going like this, I'll either remember the right path, or end up setting off all of the traps, so it's a win either way!"

 "Yeah, no, this is clearly not getting us anywhere," Hadrik says, as he stands up, "That fox is going to be here any minute. We can't afford to dawdle here while the girl tests all the traps. This corridor is compromised, but I could hear some noise below us. These ruins have a subterranean level waiting to be found, and I'm about to create a shortcut to it!"
"Don't you DARE!" Kate shouts.

"What's that?" Hadrik asks with a grin. "I'm having trouble hearing you because of all the noise those traps are making!"

He then punches the ground below us, which cracks all of the stones, and sends us falling down along with all of the rubble that used to make up the floor beneath our feet. It was a longer way down than I would have hoped, but fortunately, the surface we landed on was soft enough that we didn't break anything from the fall.

"Hadrik, how could you do something so reckless?!" Kate shouts. "Do you think we're all giants in disguise like you? Do you realize that if this unusually soft surface wasn't here to break our fall, we would have broken all our bones? I swear, if I still had my ice powers I would have smacked you so hard in the head that I'd have left you in a coma!"

As Kate talks, I can feel the surface we're on move slowly up and down. I can also hear a continuous low growl somewhere above us. Something's not right, here.

 I start to look closely at the surface we're all sitting on, to see if I can tell what it's made of. It has a sort of slithery feel to it, and if I'm not mistaken, there are small dark green scales covering the whole surface. At this point in time, I could already make an educated guess of what exactly we'd landed on, but still, a part of me did not want to believe it, so I looked up, in the hopes that my intuition was wrong.
Nine snake-like creatures, each at least six times the size of me, were all staring at me, with their fangs bared, and drool falling out of their mouths. All of the nine snakes were connected to the large body we landed on when we fell from the upper level. I've only read about creatures like these in books before, but even so, there's no mistaking it. What we've all landed on is a hydra.
 
Kate and Hadrik are still arguing and did not notice the situation we are in. Daren is only now inspecting the slithery and dark-green scale covered surface we've landed on, and Rose is looking up at the snakes, with a terrified look in her eyes, unable to bring herself to speak.

"Guys..." I tell Hadrik and Kate. "I really hate to interrupt you, but I think you should have a look at this."

 I then point upwards, and both of them freeze for a moment.
"Gods have mercy..." Hadrik says, as he seems unable to avert his eyes from the hideous creature's heads.

"Everyone get down from the hydra!" Daren shouts, as he takes Rose in his arms, and jumps off the monster's body. "NOW!"

I slide off the creature's slippery body, and land on the stone floor below. We then all distance ourselves from the hydra and arm ourselves, waiting to see what its first move will be. The snake heads all roar at the same time, and the monster starts approaching us, slowly, with its long tail swinging continuously from left to right as it walks. One of the snakes takes initiative and lunges for us. Its attack was rather slow, so we all had the time to get out of its way, but its impact with the wall behind us left a big hole in it. Daren wastes no time and uses his sword to cut off the head of the hydra with one swift strike.

"No, don't do that!" I tell him. "Why would you do that?!"

The hydra quickly retracts its headless snake body, and all of the other eight heads start screaming in pain. Then, in a matter of seconds, the severed head grows back, and all of the other heads grow quiet once more.

The hydra quickly retracts its headless snake body, and all of the other eight heads start screaming in pain. Then, in a matter of seconds, the severed head grows back, and all of the other heads grow quiet once more.

 "What?..." Daren asks me. "You didn't really believe those old legends about the hydras growing two heads for every one you cut, right? I've fought hydras before, and none of them possessed that kind of an ability. Still, the regeneration ability of this one is through the roof. Last time I fought one of these, I had more than enough time to cut off all the heads before they started regenerating, but there's no way that's going to work with this particular monster. The only way we're killing it is if we can find out where its heart is and stab it, or if we use fire, to prevent it from regenerating."
"Damnations..." Kate says. "If only I had my ice magic, I would have easily cut all those heads off simultaneously..."

"Didn't that little girl have fire magic?" Daren asks.

He then starts to shout the girl's name, while looking at the hole in the roof.

"Flower! Hey, Flower!"

There's no answer.

"You're wasting your breath," Hadrik says. "There's no way she can hear you from all the way up there, with the sound all of those traps are making."

"Yeah, you're probably right," Daren says, as he readies his sword once more and takes a look towards the monster.

The hydra has taken a few steps back while Daren was talking, and it's been just standing there for a while, hesitating to attack. It must be afraid that it'll get one of its heads cut off again.

"Well," Hadrik says. "If it's not going to come to us..."

He doesn't finish his sentence and rushes straight for the nine-headed creature. The monster attacks the dwarf with four of its heads, but he jumps out of their way and manages to place himself below the hydra's body. Hadrik then flexes all of his muscles and starts lifting the hydra off the ground, as he roars loudly and his face turns almost red from the effort. 

Before the hydra has the time to react, the dwarf sends it crashing into the nearest wall. The creature is now staggering clumsily, trying to get back up.

"I guess I can't just let a good opportunity like this go to waste," Daren says. "Barry, you take care of Rose. I'll go fight the hydra with Hadrik."

"Uh, okay..." I tell him, as he rushes towards the monster and starts slashing at its enormous body.

I turn around, and see that Rose is sitting on the floor, with her back leaning against the wall and her arms holding her legs, trying in vain to control her shivering.

I can hear someone's heart pounding very rapidly. Trying to locate the source of the sound, I realize that it isn't coming from one of us, but from the hydra. I start to block out all other sounds with my mind and focus solely on the loud beating of the monster's heart, in order to pinpoint its exact location. It takes me a few seconds, but in the end I manage to trace the sound back to its origin: the tip of the hydra's tail. So that's where it was hiding its weak point!

"Well," Hadrik says. "If it's not going to come to us..."

 "Rose!"
She doesn't give any sign of having heard me, and continues to shiver uncontrollably, while looking at the ground.

"Hey, Rose, are you with me?"

"Let her be..." Kate tells me. "She'll get over it once the hydra is dealt with and the danger passes. It was the same when we fought Tyrath. She's already doing all she can to keep control of herself."

"I... suppose you're right," I tell her, and then I turn around to see how the fight with the hydra is going.

 It doesn't seem like Hadrik and Daren are losing the fight, but it's not like they're winning, either. The hydra is using its snake heads to keep them both at bay, while Daren tries to take advantage of every opportunity he gets to stab the creature's body, in the hopes that he'll manage to find its heart through sheer luck. The hydra's large body regenerates almost as fast as its heads, so they haven't really made much progress outside of crossing out all the parts of the body where the heart is not located. This looks like it might take a while.
After a few more failed assassination attempts, Hadrik and Daren take a few steps backwards to catch their breath. Suddenly, an enormous pillar of flames engulfs the hydra, as it starts screaming in agony with all of its heads. The screams die off quickly, as the hydra turns completely black, and its charred remains fall on the ground, lifeless. Soon after the flames disappear, Flower drops from the hole in the ceiling and slows down her fall with small jets of fire coming out of her feet.

 "Are you seriously going to do this every time we fight a big monster?"
Almost as soon as I finish my phrase, I feel a very sharp pain in my abdomen, as Kate punches me with all of her strength, and makes me fall on my knees while I try to catch my breath.

"Really, now, Kate..." I tell her as I recover from her blow and get back on my feet. "I swear, I have half a mind to pay you back in kind for that blow, now that you don't have access to any of your overpowered ice spells."

"Bring it," Kate tells me, as she assumes her fighting stance. "Stat device and all. I assure you that I've trained myself in various martial arts throughout my life for just such an occasion."

Even without her ice powers, she still manages to emit that menacing aura of hers, as she looks me straight in the eye, without any sort of hesitation.

"It was a joke, Kate," I tell her, as I sigh. "Only a joke."

 I then turn around to watch the hydra fight, while Kate exits her fighting stance and leans against the wall, with her arms crossed, shifting her gaze towards the hydra as well.

I waste no time and rush towards the monster now, while it's still disoriented. 

Even while staggering, the hydra still hasn't let its guard down. As I approach it, two of the heads lunge at me, and I am forced to jump to the side in order to avoid them. I then make a rush directly for the heart and attempt to stab it, but the monster moves its tail out of my reach, and lifts it high into the air.

So, the hydra is aware of its own weak spot. I was careless. The monster has now regained its balance and it is using all of its heads to drive me into a corner. I manage to successfully dodge its first two attacks, but the third one caught me off guard. As the hydra's fangs sank through my flesh, I could see my life flash before my eyes for a few seconds, before falling to the floor and losing my consciousness for good.

I waste no time and rush towards the monster now, while it's still disoriented. 

Even while staggering, the hydra still hasn't let its guard down. As I approach it, two of the heads lunge at me, but I was so fast that they missed me by far. Just as the monster's heart is within reach of my dagger, the hydra moves its tail away from me, and lifts it high into the air.

So, the hydra is aware of its own weak spot. I was careless. The monster has now regained its balance and is using all of its heads in an attempt to drive me into a corner. However, at my current speed, dodging all of these slow overgrown snakes seems like child's play.

"Boy, what in the blazes do you think you're doing?" the dwarf asks me.

"Hadrik!" I say. "The creature's heart is in the tip of its tail. If you can pull its tail back down here, I'll deal the finishing blow with my dagger."

"Oooh, now I get it!" Hadrik says, grinning. "Consider it done."

The dwarf then jumps behind the hydra, and grabs it by the tail, pulling it down with all of his force.

"Okay, Barry!" the dwarf says as he struggles to keep a hold of the tail. "Whenever you're ready!"

 I put all of my speed into this one sprint, and I arrive near the tip of the hydra's tail in an instant, stabbing it with all of the force I could muster. The screams of all the snake heads as I pierced through the heart were painful to hear, but once I twisted the knife, their howls started to fade, and then the whole creature came crashing down on the floor with a loud thump. The hydra now lies dead besides me, but I almost feel like it's still watching me with its lifeless eyes, waiting for me to let my guard down in order to deal one last strike.
"Barry, you sly bastard!" Daren tells me as he walks towards me. "You could have told me about the hydra's weak spot, but you wanted to hog all the glory for yourself. Well, how does it feel to have slain your first hydra? You're not going to let this go to your head, are you?"

"Of course not!" I tell him. "I always meant to go on an epic monster slaying quest right after winning this tournament. A minor victory like this changes nothing!"

Daren grins.

"You cheeky little--" he starts to say, but he gets interrupted by Flower, who is now descending towards us and using two small jets of fire coming out of her feet to slow down her fall.

"Oh gods, I didn't know that there was a hydra down here!" she says. "I would have come sooner, but those traps upstairs just kept going and going!"

She then lands and looks at the monster, surprised, trying to see if it's really dead or just sleeping.

 "Hey, Daren," I say, "I just found out where the hydra is hiding its heart. It's not inside the body, it's at the tip of its tail."
"How can you be so sure?" Daren asks me.

"I've maxed out my Hearing stat. Trust me, it's there. I can still hear it beating from all the way here."

"Is that so? Well, I guess there's only one way to be sure," Daren says, and he rushes towards the hydra while it's still trying to regain its balance. 

Even while staggering, the creature still hasn't let its guard down. As Daren approaches it, two of the heads lunge at him, but he sidesteps away from one of them, and slices through the other, seizing the opportunity he created to immediately make his way towards the tip of the monster's tail. Just as he's about to stab the heart, the hydra moves its tail away and lifts it high into the air, so that Daren can no longer reach it.

The creature is not stupid. It understood Daren's intention and is also well aware of its own weak spot.

"Running away from me, eh?" Daren says. "Well, if you're not going to let me stab your heart, then I'll just have to settle for the next best thing."

 He then jumps into the air, and aims his sword at the very base of the monster's tail. He manages to cut it clean off in a single strike, and all of the hydra's heads start screaming in agony at the same time.  In a matter of seconds, all of the heads fall silent, and the hydra comes crashing down on the floor, as the life leaves its eyes for good.
"What a dumb place to keep your heart at," Daren says. "How in the hell did hydras not become extinct by now?"

"They haven't become extinct because people like you keep assuming that their hearts are inside their bodies and ignore the tail completely," Kate answers him. "Didn't you say you've fought hydras before? And yet you had no idea about this weak point. I'd say that this natural diversionary tactic of theirs has been working out pretty well for them so far."

Daren furrows his eyebrows, but he does not give Kate a reply. Suddenly, we hear Flower's voice from above, who is now descending towards us and using two small jets of fire coming out of her feet to slow down her fall.

"Oh gods, I didn't know that there was a hydra down here!" she says. "I would have come sooner, but those traps upstairs just kept going and going!"

The way she casually dealt with that hydra and the calm manner in which she's talking now makes me think that this girl has dealt with far stronger enemies in the past. I'm not sure what the situation would be if we were all at our full strength, but the way we are now, making an enemy of this little girl would be nothing short of suicide. We need to choose our words carefully, if we want to get out of here in one piece.

"Actually, I could use some healing right about now," Hadrik says. "This wound on my leg in particular is killing me!"

"We're on it!" the girl says, as she approaches the dwarf and puts her hands on his wound.

"Petal?" she asks, and then she pauses for a few moments.

The girl's eyes then start shining with a bright blue light, as her expression becomes a lot colder, and a warm light starts coming out of her hands, slowly healing Hadrik's wound.

"So..." Hadrik says, while grinning. "You must be the banshee inhabiting the girl's body. Petal, is it?"

 The girl looks the dwarf in the eye without changing her cold expression, but she doesn't say anything. She then shifts her gaze back to his wound and continues to heal it diligently.
"Not really the talkative sort, are you?" Hadrik asks, still grinning.

As the wound heals completely, the girl's eyes turn back to their normal green color, and her warm expression returns as well.

"Oh, she's usually not this silent," Flower says. "I think she's just shy around strangers..."

"Well, I think this farce has gone on long enough," Daren says, as he starts approaching Flower. "I really am sorry that I have to ruin this beautiful friendship, but I'm afraid the banshee has to go."

"Actually, I don't think that will be possible," I tell him.

"Oh yeah?" Daren says. "And why is that? Please, enlighten us, oh, great banshee expert!"

Daren waves his sword in the air for about fifteen seconds, trying to get it to light up so he can commence the purification ritual.

"It... It's not working..." Daren says, after having finally given up.

"Of course it isn't," I tell him. "The purification technique can only be used before a banshee has fully awakened, or if the banshee never existed in the first place. An awakened banshee's aura is just too erratic to be able to get a good lock on it, so the technique will simply fail to activate. The only way you can kill the banshee now is if you also kill the girl along with her. Is that what you want?"

"No, that's not... I don't..."

"I agree," Kate says. "It doesn't matter how badly the girl remembers the layout of these ruins. It's still better than having no information at all."

Hadrik sighs.

"Count me in too, I guess," he says. "Last time I tried to take the initiative we ended up in a hydra's den, so I don't really have any rights to complain."

"I..." Rose says, still not having fully recovered her voice after the hydra incident. "I think we should follow Flower as well..."

"Alright, then!" the girl says, as her face lights up. "You're not going to regret this! Come on, follow me, I know exactly where we're going!"

She then takes the lead and starts marching like a soldier in front of us, while repeatedly saying "Hut, two, three, four."

"Oh, I'm starting to regret this already..." Daren says, as we all start to follow in the girl's footsteps, and leave the hydra room behind.

After a few minutes of walking, we reach what appears to be an elevator made entirely of stone. Inside of it there are several levers, which I assume are used to operate it.

 "Okay, this elevator is going to take us back to the upper level we came from," the girl says, as we all enter it. "It's going to leave us right at the end of the corridor, so we won't have to worry about any more traps! Now, if only I could remember which one of these levers I need to pull..."
She starts looking at each lever in turn, with her eyebrows furrowed.

"Ooooooh! I can't remember which one's the right one!" the girl exclaims after ten seconds of continuous staring.

There's a mumbling sound coming from the amulet that Flower is wearing around her neck.

"What is it, Arraka?" the girl asks, as she opens the amulet.

"Hey, Flower!" the voice in the amulet says. "I remember which of the levers you need to pull in order to get to the upper level. It's the second one from the right!"

"You're not lying to me again, are you?" Flower asks, looking at the amulet suspiciously.

"Oh, no, no, it's the truth! I swear on my mother!"

"Well, okay, then..." the girl says, as she pulls the lever.

Suddenly, the elevator starts moving, but somewhat unsurprisingly, the direction we are heading in is down instead of up.

 "Please, tell me that you at least have a vague idea of where we are headed."
"Of course!" Flower says. "The first thing we need to do is get back to the corridor we came from. There's an elevator not far from here that can take us back to the upper level. It will leave us right at the end of the corridor, so we won't have to worry about any more traps!"

"That... actually sounds like a pretty good plan," Hadrik says.

"I agree," Kate says. "We can't afford to waste time bumbling around, with the spirit fox breathing down our necks. I say we follow the girl's lead for now."

"I..." Rose says, still not having fully recovered her voice after the hydra incident. "I think we should follow Flower as well..."

"Alright, then!" the girl says, as her face lights up. "You're not going to regret this! Come on, follow me, I know exactly where we're going!"

She then takes the lead and starts marching like a soldier in front of us, while repeatedly saying "Hut, two, three, four."

"Oh, I'm starting to regret this already..." Daren says, as we all start to follow in the girl's footsteps, and leave the hydra room behind.

After a few minutes of walking, we finally reach the elevator that Flower spoke of. It is entirely made of stone, but there are several levers inside of it, which I assume are used to operate it.

 "Okay, this is the elevator I told you about," the girl says, as we all enter it. "Now, if only I could remember which one of these levers I need to pull..."
She starts looking at each lever in turn, with her eyebrows furrowed.

"Ooooooh! I can't remember which one's the right one!" the girl exclaims after ten seconds of continuous staring.

There's a mumbling sound coming from the amulet that Flower is wearing around her neck.

"What is it, Arraka?" the girl asks, as she opens the amulet.

"Hey, Flower!" the voice in the amulet says. "I remember which of the levers you need to pull in order to get to the upper level. It's the second one from the right!"

"You're not lying to me again, are you?" Flower asks, looking at the amulet suspiciously.

"Oh, no, no, it's the truth! I swear on my mother!"

"Well, okay, then..." the girl says, as she pulls the lever.

Suddenly, the elevator starts moving, but somewhat unsurprisingly, the direction we are heading in is down instead of up.

 "You swore!" Flower says, furiously. "You swore on your mother!"
"I don't have a mother, you twit!" Arraka tells her, and she starts laughing hysterically.

As we descend towards the lower levels of the ruins, there are several low continuous growls audible somewhere below us.

"I've had just about enough of this," the girl says, as her eyes turn blue again, and she starts fiddling with the levers until the elevator stops in its tracks and heads back up.

"You just had to ruin all the fun like you always do, didn't you, Illuna?" the voice from the amulet says, as the girl's eyes turn green again.

"Wait, who's Illuna?" I ask the girl. "Is that the banshee's real name?"

"Never mind that," Hadrik says. "What I want to know is who the spirit in that amulet is."

"Who, me?" Arraka says. "Why, I'm the spirit of joy and laughter! This evil girl is keeping me trapped in here and won't let me do my job of spreading happiness all throughout the world! Will you not save me from this villain?"

 "Spirit of joy and laughter, eh?" Hadrik says, with his usual grin. "So I'm guessing that the sinister aura all around you must be because of the amulet the girl is keeping you in, then?"
"Hmm?" Arraka asks. "Oh, no, I just forgot to change it!"

The sinister aura around her now disappears completely, and it is replaced with one of joy and kindness.

"See? Now I'm the spirit of joy and laughter!" Arraka says, having changed her voice to resemble that of a sweet little girl. "If you don't believe me, you can just ask all of the people who've had the honor of meeting me! I always leave them with a smile on their face! Of course, it would be a little hard to get them to talk to you since they're all dead. And now that I come to think of it, the expression I usually leave them with is somewhat less of a smile, and more of a look of sheer terror. But I'm pretty sure that I've carved a few smiles into the necks of at least some of them, so it should still count, right? Aha- AHAHAHA--"

Flower interrupts Arraka's speech by closing the amulet, and then she holds on to it for a few seconds, clenching her fist around it angrily.

"So, uh..." I start to ask her, as the elevator finally reaches the corridor with the traps. "Is that another banshee, then?"

"Yes..." Flower says. "A very evil and powerful one. She was trapped in this amulet twenty years ago by the lessathi, and we've been acting as her jailers ever since."

 "Why? Did the lessathi ask you to?"
"What?" the girl asks, shocked. "No! Who would work for those mean jerks? We keep her with us because we want to! Now come on, the room with the buttons shouldn't be much further!"

"But, uh... Isn't Arraka a bit more trouble than she's worth?" I ask Flower as we start walking down the corridor. "Wouldn't it be better to just leave her somewhere and be done with her?"

"Oh, she isn't as bad as all that! She's actually helped us many times along the years, and she's even saved our lives on several occasions. Besides, she takes Petal a lot more seriously than she takes me and that's -- OH MY GODS!"

"What?" Kate asks her. "What happened?"

"I remember those three corridors!" she says as she points in front of her. "One of them leads to the control room, while the other two lead to deadly traps. I know for certain that the correct corridor had some sort of an insect marked on one of its walls! We're practically already there. Come on!"

"An insect?..." Kate asks, as Flower rushes ahead of us to have a better look at the walls of the three corridors.

"You know, uh... I'm not exactly sure how to tell you this, but... you don't really look thirty years old," I tell Flower as we start walking down the corridor.  

"Oh, my body stopped aging twenty years ago after my soul fused with Petal's! Petal keeps nagging me that I technically never made it to the age of ten, but I say to hell with that! If I want to have my birthdays, then nothing is going to-- OH MY GODS!"

 "Noooooooooooooooo!" the girl yells, as we reach the place where the path splits into three directions.
Looking at the markings on the three walls, I start to understand the source of the girl's frustration. She was not mistaken when she remembered that the correct corridor had an insect marked on it. What she failed to remember, however, was that the other two corridors had insects marked on them as well.

"A dragonfly, a beetle and a wasp..." Kate says, as she studies the markings on the walls. "Flower, you're saying that one of these three paths will lead us directly to the control room?"

"Leopard?..." Flower asks us. "You mean Leo, the leopard?"

"Yes!" Kate answers her. "Do you know him?"

"Yeah, I know him, but... I don't understand why he'd help you. He really hates humans..."

Once everyone's agreed to have me carry the blame for our potential failure, we all started walking down the corridor marked with a dragonfly. 

Before we even take five steps inside the corridor, we hear a loud noise behind us, as our way back gets sealed shut by a newly erected stone wall. Immediately afterwards, the ceiling starts descending towards us, little by little.

"Oh no..." Flower says. "Now I remember! It was the beetle! The beetle marked the correct path! Why didn't I remember this sooner?"

"Well, it's not like it's the end of the world, or anything," Hadrik says. "The ceiling is barely even moving. I'll just smash this wall blocking the exit and we can all go back to the right path."

"No!" Flower shouts. "If you smash that wall, there's going to be dozens of poisoned arrows coming out of it!"

 "Hmm..." Hadrik says. "I'm pretty sure that the beetle corridor was the one in the middle. That means that if I smash this wall on our left, we can just enter the beetle corridor directly, without having to go back."
He pauses.

"That is to say... If, uh... If everyone else is also okay with this."

"There are no traps inside the wall between the two corridors as far as I know," Flower says.

"It's okay, Hadrik," Kate says. "Feel free to smash the wall to your heart's content."

"Roger!" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he punches the wall with all of his might.

We then make our way through the hole in the wall, and we enter the beetle corridor, just as planned. 

After a few minutes of walking through the corridor, we finally start to see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Immediately after finishing his question, the floor crumbles beneath us, and we all start falling into the pit below. At the very bottom of the pit, a hundred sharp spikes were waiting for us.

 Flower rushes out of the tunnel, but her momentum fades immediately after she enters the control room, and she stops right in front of the corridor's exit. As I reach the end of the corridor myself, it takes a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the really bright light in this room.
"Congratulations!" I hear a female voice say to us, while my vision is still a little blurry. "You've made it to the control room. Now you can all die in peace, knowing that you've achieved your goal."

I suddenly realize where all the light was coming from. The great golden fox is standing right before us, and her insanely strong magical aura is shining so brightly that it's hard to even look at her. Her shape may be that of a normal fox, but her aura gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?

As I look around, I see that the room we are in is filled with levers and buttons of all shapes and sizes, just like Flower said, and there are strange writings on all of the walls. Besides the fox, there is also a leopard in the room, who appears to be one of the fox's followers.

 "Once I learned that you escaped from the dungeon," the fox says, "I knew that there was only one place where you could be heading, so instead of chasing you down, I decided to simply wait for you here. You were foolish to break out of your cell. If you had patiently awaited my judgment, you would have only been sentenced to a life of hard labor in the animal kingdom. However, breaking out of prison before hearing your sentence is a much more heinous crime. One that is punishable by death."
"Are you kidding me?!" Daren says. "Who sentences someone to a life of labor like that just because they happened to walk into a forbidden area by accident? Do you also execute your fawns and cubs if they don't keep off the grass in a park?"

"You would be wise to not address me in such a casual manner, mage in armor," the golden fox says. "But to answer your question, the animal kingdom has neither parks, nor a rule to keep off the grass in any region of the continent. However, if there were such a rule, and a cub or a fawn were to break it, then I assure you I would not hesitate in ordering their execution. Rules are meant to be upheld, both by humans and by animals. The fact that you humans are so lenient with your rules is one of the main reasons why your society is decaying to such a degree. I will hear no more of this."

Suddenly, a golden cage pops out of nowhere and surrounds every one of us except Flower.

"The five of you are not worth another second of my time," the fox says. "I am going to execute you here and now and be done with this once and for all."

 The magical power coming from her is like nothing I've ever witnessed before. I haven't even felt so much pressure when I was in the presence of Azarius. The hopelessness I'm feeling right now can only be compared with the feeling I got when we first met Eiden. Are we all just going to die like this, without even getting a chance to offer the slightest amount of resistance?
"Eleya, wait!" the girl says, as she puts herself between us and the spirit fox. "You can't hurt them! They're not bad people!"

"Do not stand in my way, Flower," the fox says. "These people broke our sacred rules, and they must be punished."

"Yeah, but can't you like, give them a slap on the wrist or something?"

"I am not going to have you question our methods or our punishments, little girl. You may have helped us in the past, but if you insist on defending these criminals, I will not hesitate to execute you along with them."

"Ooooooh! You are always so stubborn!" the girl says, as her eyes turn a bright red, and her magical aura starts to radiate strongly from her body. "Fine! If you want a fight, I'll give you your fight! Get ready, Petal!"

 Flower rushes out of the tunnel, but her momentum fades immediately after she enters the control room, and she stops right in front of the corridor's exit. As I reach the end of the corridor myself, it takes a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the really bright light in this room.
"Congratulations!" I hear a familiar voice say to us, while my vision is still a little blurry. "You've made it to the control room. Now you can all die in peace, knowing that you've achieved your goal."

I suddenly realize where all the light was coming from. The spirit fox is standing right before us, and her insanely strong magical aura is shining so brightly that it's hard to even look at her. Leo, the leopard is also at her side, but the bull appears to be missing this time around. The room is filled with levers and buttons of all shapes and sizes, just like Flower said, and there are strange writings on all of the walls.

"Once I learned that you escaped from the dungeon," the fox says, "I knew that there was only one place where you could be heading, so instead of chasing you down, I decided to simply wait for you here."

Suddenly, a golden cage pops out of nowhere and surrounds every one of us except Flower.

"It seems that my benevolence was wasted on the likes of you," the fox says. "I am going to execute you here and now and be done with this once and for all."

 "Please, stop!" the leopard says, in the common language, and Flower's eyes start to slowly go back to their normal green color.
"What is the meaning of this, Leo?" the fox asks him. "I only gave you permission to use the common language in case of an extreme emergency!"

"I am sorry if I am speaking out of turn, oh great golden fox, but I consider this to be an emergency of the utmost import."

"Explain yourself."

"I would like to invoke the sixth golden rule, and take personal custody of these prisoners."

"To what end?"

"I believe that they would be of a much better use to us alive, rather than dead. We cannot afford to send any more of our troops to the ogre stronghold. At this rate, the sacred chalice will be lost forever. But these warriors have proven their combat prowess when they defeated our hydra pet from the subterranean level. We could send them to retrieve the chalice, in exchange for their freedom."

 "I see..." the fox says. "So this is why you insisted on accompanying me to the control room when we learned that the prisoners had escaped. You surprise me, Leo. Of all the animals in our kingdom, you are by far the one who hates humans the most. I never thought I'd see the day when you would suggest using any of them to further our cause."
She pauses for a bit to ponder on his words.

"Very well, then," the fox says. "In full accordance with the sixth golden rule, I hereby grant you full custody of these five prisoners."

Eleya then turns to us.

"You were lucky to have been spared in such a way, humans," she says. "I suggest you make the most of this opportunity."

 "Could you tell us more about this ogre stronghold we are about to be sent to?"
"The ogre stronghold is a fortress located a few dozen miles  from here," Eleya says. "The ogres have been using it as their main headquarters in the area for the past few years. It is heavily defended, and very hard to infiltrate. Besides regular warriors, I am told that the ogres also have a few powerful mages within their ranks."

"Will we get our collars temporarily deactivated once we get to the ogre stronghold?" Kate asks. "I've seen collars like these before, and I know for a fact that they could be activated and deactivated at will, without having to remove them."

"I am afraid that the collars we use are a more primitive version of the ones you know of," the fox says. "Their effects will not go away unless we remove them completely, and I am not going to have them removed until you have retrieved the golden chalice. I will give you a time limit of five days to complete your quest. This should give you more than enough time to get the task done. If you are not back within five days, I will assume that you've abandoned your quest, and I will use these collars to have you killed by electrocution."

"Five days?!" Hadrik asks. "What if we get lost on our way there?"

"You won't," the fox says. "Because I'm sending a guide with you to show you the way."

 "Could you tell us more about this sacred chalice that we are meant to retrieve?"
 "The sacred chalice is an artifact that can give water unique healing properties," Eleya says. "We used this water to cure certain diseases that are specific to animals and are incurable through the use of spells. These diseases have claimed many lives of my subjects since the ogres stole our chalice and hid it in their stronghold."

"Will we get our collars temporarily deactivated once we get to the ogre stronghold?" Kate asks. "I've seen collars like these before, and I know for a fact that they could be activated and deactivated at will, without having to remove them."

 She then turns to Flower.
"Flower, since you were so eager to protect these humans with your life, I am assigning this task to you."

"Uh... I don't really think they'd still want me as their guide after all that happened in these ruins... Couldn't you maybe send Leo, or--"

"No, I am sending you. Consider this your punishment for confronting me earlier. Of course, I am not forcing you to go. If you do not want to take on this task, I will simply execute them right now and spare you the trouble."

"No!" Flower shouts. "No, don't do that! Okay, I get it... I'll... go with them to the ogre stronghold."

"Very well, then," the fox says, as she turns to leave. "Leo, I leave you in charge of giving them their mission briefing. I have some other business to attend to."

"So, uh..." Flower says to us, as the fox leaves the room. "I guess we'll be travelling together for a while longer..."

She then starts laughing nervously and unnaturally again. 

Oh, boy...

Even without using my premonition stat, there's one thing that I'm definitely sure of. This is going to be one hell of a trip.
