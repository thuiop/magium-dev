This has got to be the worst hangover I've ever had in my life. What did I even drink yesterday to bring me in this state?<br/><br/>I can't remember. And if I so much as try to focus on remembering anything that happened before I went to sleep, it starts feeling like a hundred small daggers are moving through my brain. I need to go back to sleep. I'm sure everything will be better once I get more rest.<br/><br/>That's right. I need to sleep. Just gonna keep my eyes closed and put my head on the pillow. Do I even have a pillow? Where was it that I fell asleep again? It doesn't matter. All I have to do is go to bed, and I'll figure everything out afterwards.<br/><br/> Something's not right. I can't lie down for some reason. It feels like my upper body is being held into an upright position by an unknown force that won't let go. Now this force is shaking me violently. It wants me to wake up, but I won't lose to it. My eyes are staying closed.<br/>The force is still shaking me. It just doesn't know when to give up. Can't it see that I'm trying to sleep, here? Talk about being rude. Maybe I should give this mysterious force a piece of my mind. If I tell it off, it might go away and leave me alone. I just need to choose the right words, to make sure that it will stop bothering me for good.<br/><br/>",

I guess that when you grow up in an environment like that, you get to build up a bit of tolerance to pain and nausea without realizing it. Come on, let's see if we can get you to take a few steps forward. I'm sure you'll feel better once you make a little progress.\"<br/>I take her advice and I try to move away from my initial location, placing one foot in front of the other while still holding onto Leila to maintain my balance. After no more than ten seconds I ask Leila to put me back down, because I was beginning to feel like I was on the verge of fainting again.<br/><br/>\"This isn't working,\" I tell Leila, while I'm still resting on the ground, with my back against a wall. \"I think you might have to go ahead without me. At this rate, I'm only going to slow you down, and you need to find your father as quickly as possible. Just leave me here, and I'll catch up with you later, I promise!\"<br/><br/>\"Don't be stupid...\" Leila writes. \"I'm not leaving you behind. If any of the royal guards teleport themselves here and find you in this state, they will kill you in a heartbeat. Give me a moment. I'll try to see if I can remember a technique that I learned from my father a while back. He used to do this for me sometimes, when the other lessathi from the Beacon weren't looking, and it got rid of some of the pain from my head. I think it worked like this.\"<br/><br/> Leila now kneels next to me and she begins to lightly massage both my temples with her hands. As she is doing this, I can feel the aura around my head changing its flow and becoming calmer and calmer with each passing moment. Once she is finally done with her technique, the pain in my head gets greatly reduced and even though a strong feeling of nausea still remains, it has become much more bearable.<br/>\"That was incredible!\" I tell Leila, as she is now getting back up. \"It felt almost like you were using magic. Or at least an aura manipulation technique, like the captain of the guards!\"<br/><br/>\"Even if I can't cast spells,\" Leila writes, \"I'm still pretty good at sensing the flow of auras, so as long as I can find the right pressure points, I can eventually figure out what I need to do.\"<br/><br/>She then offers me her hand, and she helps me get back on my feet.<br/><br/>\"How are you feeling?\" Leila writes. \"Do you think you can walk?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I tell her. \"I'm still feeling nauseous, but it's nothing compared to how I was before. But what about you? Is the pain in your head still there? Have you tried using this technique on yourself to see if it works?\"<br/><br/>\"I've tried it in the past, but it only seems to work if you're using it on someone else,\" Leila writes. \"The pain is still there, but... I can manage. Anyway, let's see if we can trace back our steps from yesterday. I think we need to go this way first. Are you coming?\"<br/><br/>",

There weren't even any guards patrolling these corridors, so the king and his men clearly didn't know about their existence.

In fact it wasn't the aura itself that caught my attention, but the flow of magic inside of it that is specific to someone who is currently shapeshifting. The flow is clearly unstable. I've studied how shapeshifting is supposed to work, and none of what he is doing is standard procedure. He must be using some sort of poorly modified version of the normal shapeshifting spell so that he can gain wings and other useful appendages without the need to fully transform himself into a different creature. Maybe there is some way in which I can turn this instability of his aura into an advantage for me?<br/><br/>As I am standing there, thinking, Gontrok attacks me again with an extremely quick punch, making me jump behind to dodge him while Leila is once more looking for a good opportunity to flank my opponent. It feels like there are dozens of concurrent thoughts racing through my head while I'm avoiding Gontrok's seemingly endless attacks. Out of all the ideas that are coming to me right now, two in particular seem rather promising, but they both involve using a variation of Leila's father's massage technique to mess with the giant's aura.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_magical_sense || 0) >= 4) {%> If I could find the right pressure points, I might be able to briefly stun him or to at least make him feel a strong feeling of nausea, but to do this while he is focusing all of his attacks on me might be a little risky. The second idea would be for me to tell Leila to use the pressure point technique on Gontrok while I'm keeping him busy, but I'm not sure if she would be able to modify the massage technique correctly unless I give her a very specific step by step guide in the middle of the battle.<br/>Both options have their ups and downs, so I guess I'm going to have to go with my instincts, on this one.<br/><br/><% } %>",

If the information I have is true, then it should be easy enough to distinguish the fake attacks from the real ones, because whenever he actually wants to hit me, he will get a little closer to me so that his punches can have more of an impact. If I don't see him trying to close the gap between us too much, then he's probably just going for a feint. With this info, I should be able to hold out against him long enough for Leila to give me another opening. Let's see if it works.<br/><br/><% } %>",

Basically, what I need you to do is to join your fingers together and hit several pressure points on the back of his neck instead of pressing your whole palm on his forehead.\"<br/><br/>\"But... how would that be the same as my father's technique, then?...\" Leila writes, confused, as Gontrok has now stopped to look at me with wide eyes, probably wondering if I'd gone mad.<br/><br/>\"The fact that you have to use pressure points to affect his aura is the same, but the method is slightly different,\" I say. \"Don't worry, I'll try to guide you step by step.\"<br/><br/>\"You want to give me a massage, now?\" Gontrok asks me. \"Are these the last ramblings of a man that has already accepted his death? Why don't you come here, so I can put you out of your misery?\"<br/><br/>\"Leila, do it now!\" I say, as I rush to attack Gontrok with my dagger.<br/><br/>\"Your dagger won't work on me, you buffoon,\" Gontrok says, as I attack him and then quickly step back so that he doesn't have time to grab my weapon.<br/><br/> At the same time, Leila joins her fingers together and hits Gontrok in the neck several times from behind, like I told her, but it doesn't seem to be having much of an effect on his aura.<br/>\"And giving me neck massages isn't going to help you either!\" Gontrok says, as he attempts to grab Leila again, but she steps back just in time.<br/><br/>\"Leila, let's try it one more time, but slower,\" I say. \"I'll tell you when it will start to work.\"<br/><br/>\"You two are really testing my patience...\" Gontrok says, and then he begins to attack me once again, forcing me to get back.<br/><br/>Leila tries to disrupt the giant's aura a few more times while I'm keeping him distracted, but ultimately she does not manage to figure out how she's supposed to modify her father's technique to give Gontrok a headache, and it is too difficult for me to show her what she needs to do while I'm busy avoiding my opponent's punches. After a few more failed attempts of Leila and me trying to defeat Gontrok, we suddenly sense the presence of a familiar dark-skinned mercenary who is apparently now slowly making his way into our corridor.<br/><br/>\"Sorry to interrupt,\" Loyrang says, in his usual casual tone, while his hands are positioned near the hilts of his two blades, ready to unsheathe them if the need arises. \"I was going to let you finish your fight but it was taking a little too long so I got bored of waiting until the end.\"<br/><br/>",

Think!<br/>\"Ready when you are, princess,\" Gontrok says. \"I'll start counting the sixty seconds as soon as you hit your first attack.\"<br/><br/>Leila nods, and almost immediately afterwards she dashes towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to slit his throat with both her daggers. Despite her best efforts, however, Leila's blades are easily stopped by the giant's thick skin and neither of her cuts is deep enough to even draw blood. <br/><br/>\"Is that all you got?\" Gontrok taunts her. \"And here I was, hoping for an actual challenge! What a disappointment.\"<br/><br/>As Leila prepares to hit him again, I suddenly come up with an idea that might just work, but I won't know for sure until I test it. Let's give it a try.<br/><br/>I move behind Gontrok, I join the fingers of my right hand together and then I use them to hit the back of his neck several times, while closely monitoring the flow of his aura.<br/><br/> \"Hey, stop trying to prick my neck, you damn imbecile!\" Gontrok says. \"Have you gone mad? I said stop it!\"<br/>\"What's the matter, Gontrok?\" Leila writes. \"Afraid of a little massage?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not afraid of anything!\" Gontrok says furiously. \"He can massage me all he wants, but as soon as your sixty seconds are up, he's dead!\"<br/><br/>I ignore Gontrok's ramblings and I continue with what I was doing. If my gut feeling is right, then if I try a variation of Leila's father's massage technique, I might be able to disrupt the giant's aura enough to get him to drop off his feet, which would make him automatically lose his bet with Leila since he's not allowed to move. All I need to do is find the right pressure points.<br/><br/>",

I assure you that he is planning to dispose of you the minute after the tournament is over.\"<br/>\"You can't know that!\" Gontrok says.<br/><br/>\"Of course I can!\" Loyrang says. \"I know people! It doesn't take me much to figure out what opinion the king has of you. I could see it all on his face every time he spoke with you. The man doesn't trust you one bit. He's been leading you on this whole time. He's been using your own greed against you to keep you on a leash. That's why he made you the new captain. He knows exactly what you're after, and he isn't afraid to give you what you want in order to avoid raising your suspicions. He wants you to be his loyal dog until the moment when he'll no longer need you, at which point he'll have you executed without a second thought.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"I've heard enough of this!\" Gontrok says. \"You're not going to help anyone kill the king. I won't let you.\"<br/>\"Is that supposed to be a threat?\" Loyrang says, in his characteristic laidback tone. \"Gontrok, my friend... Have you never wondered why I decided to travel together with you when I came across you on the first day of the tournament? Did you really think that I would risk walking side by side all this time with someone that I thought would have even the slightest chance of defeating me in battle? You clearly must not know me very well.\"<br/><br/>\"So, first you insult my intelligence, and now you insult my combat prowess?\" Gontrok says, as he seems to barely be able to contain his rage. \"Do you seriously think that you can afford to be so confident just because those weapons of yours are sharp enough to cut through my skin?\"<br/><br/>\"Trust me, it's not just because of the sharpness of my weapons that I am being confident,\" Loyrang says. \"If you don't believe me, you're free to test my skills whenever you're ready. Just don't blame me if you lose an arm or two in the process...\"<br/><br/>Gontrok suddenly lets out a laugh, but it's not the kind of laugh that someone lets out when they're being amused by something. It's more the kind of laugh that you would normally expect to hear from someone who is only a few moments away from snapping.<br/><br/> \"What a day this has been...\" Gontrok says, once he's done laughing. \"First I had to babysit that whiney teleporter guy, then I got taken for a fool by these two chumps, and now my trusted comrade-in-arms tells me that he's about to cut my arms off. And to top it all off, there is this most annoying buzzing sound in the background going on and on and on while I'm trying to talk, and it's PISSING ME OFF!!!\"<br/>Gontrok is right. I'm not sure exactly when it started, but all of the blue crystals that are embedded in the cavern walls around us have been vibrating for a while, and it feels like they're getting louder by the second. Gontrok pauses for a few moments, hoping that the sound might go away by itself, but when he realizes that it's only going to get louder from now on, he raises his voice, probably in an attempt to drown out the noise coming from the crystals.<br/><br/> \"So, you want to show me how much stronger you are, Loyrang?! Gontrok shouts. \"Is that it? Or maybe your strategy is to fool me into thinking that it's going to be a fair fight but you've instead laid a trap for me on the floor in front of me? I know your type... You're not planning to fight fair at all, are you? Don't try to lie to me; I know what you non-giants are like. You're all the same! Every single one of you! Would it kill you people to fight with at least some shred of dignity? Does honor mean nothing to you? Is there-- ARGH, will this thrice-damned noise never end?! What is wrong with these crystals? Can't you see that I'm trying to have a conversation here?! Be silent, damn you! I said BE QUIET!!!\"<br/>As he is shouting those last two words, Gontrok furiously hits one of the crystals from the wall on his left with the side of his fist. Instead of shattering, however, the crystal begins to emit a blue light that is much brighter than the one before, which fills up the whole corridor and effectively blinds us for a few seconds. Then, as we are all slowly regaining our sight, we suddenly hear Gontrok's scream, full of both anger and utter disbelief.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"What the hell is this?!\" Gontrok shouts, while showing us his left hand.<br/>What I am now seeing is extremely hard to put into words. It looks as if his left hand had been essentially cut in half, with its pinky finger and its ring finger missing entirely, as well as the two knuckles corresponding to them and the left side of his palm. Yet somehow, his hand looks like it's been that way ever since he was born. Not only is there no blood coming out of the missing fingers, but there is also no scar tissue to be seen. If someone were to see his hand now for the first time, there would be no reason for them to believe that those two missing fingers ever existed.<br/><br/>But that is not all... For a fraction of a second, when I first laid eyes upon his hand after the blinding flash of blue light, I was almost convinced that his hand had been like this the whole time. Even though I still have clear memories of his hand being intact only moments ago, I was on the verge of believing that Gontrok's left hand has had only three fingers since the very beginning. As I am struggling to understand how something like this could have happened, Gontrok shouts again, while taking a good look at every person in the room beside him.<br/><br/>\"Why are you all looking at me like that, you daft fools?!\" Gontrok says, as he is holding up his left hand to make sure that everyone can see it properly. \"Do you not have eyes? I'll ask again. What the HELL is this?!\"<br/><br/> \"What do you mean 'what is this'?...\" Loyrang says. \"It's your hand. Have you seriously gone so far off the deep end that you've forgotten what your left hand looks like?\"<br/>\"Look at the fingers, you imbecile!\" Gontrok shouts. \"Do you not see that there are only three?!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, there are only three fingers on your left hand,\" Loyrang says. \"There have always been only three fingers on your left hand. Do you expect us to pity you now? Are you going to tell me that you want me to fight you with one hand behind my back to even the odds?\"<br/><br/>\"You are taking this joke too far, Loyrang,\" Gontrok says. \"These two fingers disappeared out of the blue after I hit the crystal with them and you know it! You saw it happen with your own eyes! You were all here!\"<br/><br/>\"Gontrok, snap out of it!\" the illusionist says. \"This traitorous bastard must have cast some sort of mind affecting spell on you while we were distracted by the blue light. Listen to me. You've never had more than three fingers on your left hand. It is the way you were born. Don't get fooled by a simple trick like this, damn it!\"<br/><br/>As the three royal guards are arguing, Leila pulls me lightly by the sleeve and when I turn to look at her, I can see that she is looking rather distraught.<br/><br/>\"Barry... please tell me that I'm not going crazy,\" Leila writes. \"You also remember Gontrok having five fingers on his left hand before, right? It's not just some mind affecting spell. Those fingers really existed... right?\"<br/><br/>",

How does it feel to know that the only meaningful purpose your head will ever have is to keep rain drops from falling down your throat?\"<br/>As soon as Eiden revealed himself, all of the crystals in the cave around us began to vibrate louder and more frequently than before. They're reacting to him... But why? Is it because he's a stillwater? No, that's not it. Melindra is also a stillwater and I've never seen the crystals behave this way around her. But then what is the reason?<br/><br/>Just as I ask myself this question, I suddenly remember how Arraka mentioned at one point that Eiden and the golden fox must have learned the food creation spell from the Magium itself. If Eiden and the fox are connected to the Magium in some way, then it could explain why the crystals are reacting like this, but why are they only vibrating and not doing something more? Just what are these crystals made of, exactly?<br/><br/>\"So, it was you,\" Gontrok says, as he tries to turn his head a little so he can see Eiden with the tail of his eye. \"These crystals were reacting to you all this time. You're the one doing this.\"<br/><br/> \"A brilliant deduction,\" Eiden says, as he is getting closer to the giant. \"Now tell me, Gontrok, who gave the orders to destroy the underground rebel lair, which happens to be just as full of these blue crystals as the caverns that we are currently in? Was it you or the king?\"<br/>\"The king gave the orders, but I was the one who carried them out,\" Gontrok says, and then he laughs. \"Your precious rebels must all be dead by now, aren't they? And so are your intruder friends. I know you've been trying to help them. I'm not that stupid. I could tell what you were doing even if the king refused to see it. But now they're all dead, except for these two shmucks, here. How does that make you feel? Are you finally ready to show your true colors? Are you going to avenge your friends and kill the royal guards who massacred them?\"<br/><br/>\"Your royal guards are already dead,\" Eiden says. \"The rebels, the king of the underground and the 'intruders' made short work of them and they will likely soon also be done with the troops that have been sent after them.\"<br/><br/>\"No, that's impossible!\" Gontrok shouts, as he is still holding his arm above his head with the rock in his hand, unable to move it. \"You're lying! You can't--\"<br/><br/>\"Listen to me, Gontrok,\" Eiden says in a serious tone, as he uses his aura manipulation technique to rotate Gontrok towards him, while still keeping his right arm up in order to annoy him. \"I could not care less whether you believe me or not. The only reason why I'm still keeping you alive is because I still have a question to ask you. So tell me, Gontrok, has the king mentioned anything to you about the third golden rule?\"<br/><br/> \"Golden rule?\" Gontrok says. \"What kind of nonsense are you blathering about? And what is it with you humans and your cowardly techniques? Is this seriously what you call a fight? Are you planning to just hold me immobilized like this and drive a sword through my heart without even giving me a chance to defend myself? Where is your honor?\"<br/>\"Honor?\" Eiden says, looking genuinely confused. \"Pardon me for asking, but are you not the same Gontrok that was famous for having killed the most dwarven civilians during the last great war from the Northern Continent?...\"<br/><br/>\"So what?\" Gontrok says. \"What does that have to do with anything?\"<br/><br/>\"Ah, I see,\" Eiden says. \"So that's how it is...\"<br/><br/>He then releases Gontrok from his aura technique, which prompts the giant to finally lower his arm and to drop the rock that he had been holding until now.<br/><br/>\"You are free to attack me now,\" Eiden says. \"I will not be using any magic whatsoever to fight you. I hope you will enjoy your last 'honorable' duel.\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know what's going through that head of yours, but I'll make sure that you'll regret this,\" Gontrok says.<br/><br/>",

After a few seconds of effortlessly dodging the attacks in the same way that he dodged Daren during their first encounter, Eiden grabs Gontrok's right arm in the middle of one of his strikes, he twists it behind his back and then he hits several pressure points near his elbow in rapid succession.<br/>Right afterwards, Eiden presses his left palm against the outside of Gontrok's elbow while still holding his arm with his other hand, and this causes the giant's forearm to bend backwards in an extremely unnatural way, while we can hear him screaming in agony.<br/><br/>\"What did you do to me, you crazy bastard?!\" Gontrok says as he is sweating something fierce, with his right arm just dangling beside him like a useless piece of meat.<br/><br/>\"I gave you an honorable duel,\" Eiden says, coldly, with his eyes still closed. \"Isn't this what you wanted?\"<br/><br/>\"Go plough yourself, you sadistic piece of crap!\" Gontrok says, and then he tries to punch Eiden with the three remaining fingers from his left hand.<br/><br/>Eiden catches the incoming fist with his right hand and then he bends the giant's fingers backwards until we hear them crack. As Gontrok screams again, Eiden puts his left hand on the giant's head, making it explode into a million pieces of meat and blood that cover the floor and walls around him. As the giant's body is about to fall to the ground, Eiden uses a fire spell to incinerate it completely, leaving only ashes of the once proud warrior called Gontrok.<br/><br/> \"Now, then...\" Eiden says, as he is using a water spell to clean his pajamas of blood. \"Was there anyone else who wanted to have a duel?\"<br/>\"No, I think you've made your point quite clearly, actually,\" says Loyrang, whose uniform is still covered in the blood of his former colleague.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Eiden says, and then he begins heading in the direction of the seredium tower as he slowly turns invisible again. \"I will now be paying the king of Ollendor a short visit. If you do not arrive there too late, you might get to hear a rather interesting conversation. I trust that you still know how to find your way to the seredium tower?\"<br/><br/>\"Umm, yes,\" I say. \"Yes, we still know the way.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" Eiden says. \"In that case, I will leave the secret doors unlocked for you. I will be looking forward to seeing your next interaction with the Overseer.\"<br/><br/>\"What?...\" I say. \"Why? What's going to happen with the Overseer?\"<br/><br/>There is no answer. Eiden is probably already gone.<br/><br/>\"I think Eiden must have teleported somewhere further into the tunnels,\" I say. \"We should probably go after him. Loyrang, you said you were coming with us?\"<br/><br/> \"Actually, I've changed my mind,\" Loyrang says. \"From what I understood, the stillwater will be waiting for you in the tower, and to be quite honest, I would prefer to stay as far away from him as possible.\" <br/>\"Yeah, I guess that's understandable,\" I say. \"See you around, then.\"<br/><br/>\"Before I go, I should probably give you one last piece of advice,\" Loyrang says. \"If you're worried about the undetectable illusionist mage attacking you while your guard is down, you should know that he cannot use any offensive spells and that the only thing he is good at is helping his allies from the shadows by casting illusions or by using spells to temporarily daze his enemies. As long as he doesn't have anyone to work together with, he won't really be much of a threat to you. Just thought I'd let you know.\"<br/><br/>",

There was no sign of an injury on Gontrok's hand, and you saw how Loyrang and the illusionist reacted when they were asked about it. Neither of them remembered that he even had five fingers to begin with!\"<br/><br/>\"But a lot of us still remembered them,\" Leila writes. \"The two of us did, and so did Gontrok and even Eiden. Do you think this means that the crystals failed to erase the fingers properly from everyone's minds for some reason?\"<br/><br/>\"No, my theory is that everyone in the world who knew about those fingers has forgotten about them, and that we were the exceptions,\" I say. \"For Gontrok, it might have been too difficult to erase the notion of his fingers from his mind, because he had too many memories of them ever since his birth and removing all those memories would have resulted in his mind deteriorating beyond the point of recovery. In Eiden's case, I think he might be connected to the Magium somehow, because those crystals were clearly reacting to his presence. That would also explain why he seemed so unfazed after seeing Gontrok's fingers disappear, because it was probably something that he had already witnessed a few times before in the past.\"<br/><br/>\"But what about us?\" Leila writes.<br/><br/> \"In our case, I think it might have been because we both have lessathi blood in our veins,\" I say. \"There was this experiment that Arraka was conducting while we were in the Magium's territory that I didn't really pay much attention to at the time, but I think it might help to explain what is happening. When we were spectating Kate's ritual in the Beacon of Hope, Arraka kept trying to get the attention of some of the lessathi that were in charge of the orphanage. When she did eventually manage to get one of them to react to what she was doing despite her being in a completely different dimension, she concluded that all lessathi must have some sort of natural affinity to the Magium, and that this is part of the reason why many of them are so good at making these devices that require you to understand magic at a very complex level. I think it is also due to this natural affinity to the Magium that we were still able to remember the existence of Gontrok's fingers. If we were to ask any of our friends about them now, I doubt any of them would be able to even imagine a Gontrok that ever had five fingers on his left hand.\"<br/><br/> \"That is... kind of scary to think about,\" Leila writes. \"Just the thought of us having experienced a completely different reality from our friends despite being right there at their side the whole time is enough to give me goose bumps all over my skin. Right now we're only talking about two fingers on someone's hand, but I can't even begin to imagine how it would have felt trying to convince Kate or Daren of your existence if the Magium had actually succeeded in making you disappear. I might have begun to even doubt my own memories of you if I were to become the very last person in this world to remember that you even existed...\"<br/>\"You're right,\" I say. \"I haven't even considered that. Well, I guess now I have an extra reason for not wanting to be trapped in that void again. What you described right now is something that I would really not want to put you through.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you,\" Leila writes. \"If there's any way I can help, please tell me.

Since she wanted us to kill the king and not simply sneak into the palace to steal from him, my guess is the item must be something that his \u2018royal highness\u2019 would normally bring with him at all times, but I have no idea what it could be. Any ideas?\"<br/>\"Unfortunately, I cannot help you with this query, as I am not familiar with your friend's history or her motivations,\" the Overseer says.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I figured as much,\" I say. \"I guess I'll check his pockets first, then. Or maybe it could be one of those rings on his fingers? Let me see...\"<br/><br/>As I am searching through the dead king's pockets, the Overseer's green-eyed drone suddenly begins to act very strangely. It is constantly moving up and down, then left and right without any rhyme or reason, and it seems that its behavior is only getting worse.<br/><br/>\"Umm, Overseer?\" I say. \"Are you alright there, buddy? Had a little too much to drink last night?\"<br/><br/>\"There is... a voice,\" the green-eyed drone blurts out all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"A voice?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"It is a different voice every time it speaks, but I can tell it is the same entity,\" the Overseer says. \"It is calling out to me from a place that is beyond analysis. Beyond reason.\"<br/><br/> As he is saying this, I can hear something vibrating loudly from within the drone. The sound it is making is eerily familiar. When I recognize what that sound is, I freeze for a moment, and then I immediately remember a conversation that Hadrik and Arraka had when we first arrived to the rebel base:<br/>\"So, if I wanted, I could just mess with the auras of some rocks, and I'd have my own personal army of highly intelligent stone golems, then?...\" I remember Hadrik asking.<br/><br/>\"Sure,\" Arraka answered him. \"If you also combine those rocks with some seredium, and some of the blue crystals lying around these caves, and a bunch of other stuff, and then spend a few decades working on them by using the knowledge you acquired from the Magium, then yes, you'll have your army. Call me in thirty years, and tell me how that's worked out for you.\"<br/><br/>Blue crystals. These drones were all built with blue crystals inside of them. How could I forget this?<br/><br/>I was careless to think that we would be safe from the Magium if we reached the surface. I should not have let my guard down so easily. Maybe there's still time. Maybe if we slowly distance ourselves from the drone, we could--<br/><br/>\"Where is the one called Arraka?\" the Overseer asks us, in a voice that is completely different from his usual tone.<br/><br/>",

I don't know where she is, exactly.\"<br/>\"Arraka's actions have threatened the very fabric of all existence and she must be stopped at all costs,\" the green-eyed drone says, in the same unusual tone of voice. \"You will reveal her location or this world will be undone from its seams until she is found. Starting with this room.\"<br/><br/>\"Listen, we really don't know where she is, but I think you might be mistaken!\" I say. \"Arraka is stuck in an amulet. There is no way she could have realistically threatened anyone with doing anything more than just shouting in their ear and not letting them sleep at night! If you could give us some time, I'm sure we can quickly clear this misunderstanding and--\"<br/><br/>\"Your time is up,\" the green-eyed drone says, simply, and then I begin to experience a sensation that I've never felt before and that I never imagined would even be possible.<br/><br/> Instead of being trapped in a void like last time, I can now feel myself existing in the earthen plane, the magical plane and the ethereal plane all at once, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. I have no idea why I am so certain that this is what's happening, since logically speaking, I have absolutely no way of knowing what the magical plane or the ethereal plane would feel like, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is indeed what I am experiencing.<br/>Yet at the same time, I am also somehow still inside that same room, except the room looks nothing like before. The workshop is falling apart before my eyes. The objects inside the room are all flying around and it looks like there is a strong wind of some sort that is also raising me in the air at the same time. And the wind isn't just raising me in the earthen plane either, but in the other two planes as well. It feels like my very soul is being sucked out of me while my body is being thrown around the earthen and magical plane like some cosmic rag doll.<br/><br/>Nothing makes sense anymore. Up is down, right is left, and my consciousness feels like it' being ripped apart from all directions.<br/><br/>\"I will be looking forward to seeing your next interaction with the Overseer,\" I hear Eiden's words in the back of my mind as I am being flung around across multiple dimensions.<br/><br/>The bastard knew. He knew something like this would happen. I'm going to kill him. I swear I will kill him.<br/><br/> \"Barry, grab my hand!\" I suddenly hear a woman's desperate voice, as I am gradually losing my consciousness.<br/>I immediately recognize the voice as being that of Leila, even though I've never heard her speak before and even her laughs and screams have always been silent. When I turn to her, I see that she is also being carried by the strong wind, and that she has her right hand extended towards me while she is floating in the air.<br/><br/>\"Grab my hand, quick!\" I hear her say again, but now I can clearly see that her mouth is closed while she is talking.<br/><br/>Am I... hearing her thoughts? Is it because we're both in the ethereal plane, which is the plane of existence where our minds reside? Does this mean that she can hear what I'm thinking now as well?<br/><br/>\"You idiot!\" I hear Leila shouting with her mouth still closed, suggesting that she did indeed hear what I was just thinking. \"Stop trying to make sense of things and grab onto me already! You're getting pulled away!\"<br/><br/>",

As Leila is still calling out to me, the air currents get much stronger and I get carried further and further away from her, until I can't hear her or anything else anymore. All is now silent, and the world around me is gone. There is only emptiness. As the memory of who I once was becomes more and more blurred, I close my eyes and my consciousness slowly fades away, never to be awoken again.<br/><br/>",

It probably didn\u2019t even know who I was or what I did in the Magium\u2019s realm. The only reason why it even reacted to these two losers in the first place was because it could most likely sense from their auras that they\u2019ve been in contact with the Arraka from Selkram\u2019s ritual, and so it must have assumed that she was hiding somewhere in this world.

Why don't you do what you really came here to do and give your good friend Barry a big hug?\"<br/><br/> \"Okay, first of all, you shut up,\" Daren tells Melindra. \"And secondly, if nobody else has anything to say, I'd like to call Albert on the transceiver now.\"<br/>\"Actually, I have just one short question before we go,\" I say. \"Daren, do you remember how many fingers Gontrok had on his left hand?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" Daren says. \"He had three fingers. Why do you ask?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I just wanted to confirm something,\" I say, as Leila and I exchange a quick glance. \"Don't worry about it.
