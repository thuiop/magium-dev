        "text": " \"Its true purpose?...\" I say, and then I take a few seconds to think about what Arraka said. \"Well, when a banshee awakens, the first thing that she wants to do is--\"<br/>I stop talking suddenly, because the image of my sister turning into a banshee suddenly flashes in front of my eyes, as I am trying to remember the details of the awakening. Once I calm myself down, I continue with my train of thought.<br/><br/>\"The first thing that she wants to do is to seize full control of the host's body,\" I say. \"When I was inside the God of Time's ritual, I could almost... feel the desperation with which the banshee was clinging onto her own life, fighting to drive my sister out of her body, so that she could claim it as her own. But if that banshee really was trying to use the spell you just showed me, then she was clearly using it wrong. That spell was never meant to be focused on the body, was it? Its real target should have been the soul of the victim. That is the real reason why the banshee who possessed my sister turned into an abominable monstrosity, while you and the banshee working for Talmak could retain the forms of your hosts. The true purpose of the spell you just showed me is... soul absorption.\"<br/><br/> Immediately after I say these last two words, Arraka casts a spell that makes it sound like she is slowly clapping her hands.<br/>\"Bravo!\" Arraka says, while the sound of clapping can still be heard in the background. \"Bravo. Of the hundreds of people that I asked this question to in the past, you and Illuna were the only ones to have answered it correctly so quickly. Oh, and I suppose Flower figured it out on her own too, but I never really bothered to ask her the question, so it doesn't count.\"<br/><br/>\"You asked this question to hundreds of people?\" I say. \"But... to whom?\"<br/><br/> \"Banshees, mostly,\" Arraka says. \"There was a time in the past where I may have had a... slight feeling of guilt regarding the expulsion of the female spirits from the magical plane. A very tiny, almost insignificant sense of guilt, mind you, but still guilt nonetheless. That is why I've spent the first few days after my banishment five thousand years ago teaching several of the older and wiser female spirits how to absorb souls in order to survive on this plane of existence. At first they refused, of course, but once it became clear to them that they had no way to survive in this world without acquiring an earthen body, most of them reluctantly agreed to use my technique. These older spirits then took it upon themselves to teach the soul absorption technique to as many banished spirits as they could find, and so, the first generation of banshees was formed. I'm not sure how many of those first ones are still alive to this day, but I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few of them were still around. Otherwise, I don't really see how the banshee working for the northern sage would have been able to find out about me and my initial role in the banishment of all female spirits.\"<br/>\"But... why are you teaching me how to absorb souls?\" I ask Arraka. \"What purpose could you possibly have for doing such a thing?\"<br/><br/>\"Why don't you try answering that question yourself, Barry-boy?\" Arraka says. \"What do you think is my purpose for teaching you about this spell?\"<br/><br/>",

I'm not sure if you have an equivalent word for it here on the earthen plane, or if your people even know about it, but it's the place where all spells are defined. You know how most spells have certain rules and limitations, right? Well, the tapestry is the place where these rules are imprinted when the spells are first created. Every mage can access it subconsciously, although it takes a great deal of skill to find a spell in it that you don't already know about from somewhere else. Normally, you should have also had access to the tapestry when you had the opportunity to use your magical stats.\"<br/>\"Now that you mention it, what you say does sound somewhat familiar,\" I tell Arraka. \"I always did figure that the spells must be coming from somewhere on the magical plane, but I never stopped to think about how it all worked until now.\"<br/><br/>\"The tapestry is not on the magical plane, or on any other plane for that matter,\" Arraka says. \"It is one of the few remnants from the days when all three planes of existence were still united, just like the auras and the primordial spells.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" I say. \"So basically what you're saying is that if I switch my consciousness to the ethereal plane right now, I should be able to cast that soul absorption spell of yours?\"<br/><br/> \"No, not the soul absorption spell,\" Arraka says. \"I only showed that to you so you could understand the basic principles behind it. Even the very crude version of the spell that I taught to the banshees would be too difficult for you to understand, since you're not a magical spirit that can learn these things intuitively. However, I do have a few spells in mind that will be particularly useful against the God of Time, and against that sad copy of me from the parallel universe that we were sent to during the ritual.\"<br/>\"But what about Eiden?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"I don't know,\" Arraka says. \"What about him?\"<br/><br/>\"You fought against him before, didn't you?\" I ask her. \"Surely you must know some of his weaknesses! Or at least a few of the loopholes that he used to defeat you.\"<br/><br/>\"His 'loopholes', as you call them were largely irrelevant on their own,\" Arraka says. \"The first time when I fought Eiden during the still winter, he was barely comparable to one of the low-tier gods that I massacred on the magical plane when I went on my initial rampage. Sure, he had a ridiculous amount of magical power, and his inventive way of bypassing the rules of spells was rather impressive, but those were not the kind of tricks that I was complaining about when I told you before about my fight against him.\"<br/><br/>\"They're not?\" I say. \"Then what?\"<br/><br/> \"Like I was saying, in my first battle against Eiden, I bested him easily,\" Arraka says. \"I would have killed him too, if that idiot stillwater Therius hadn't stopped me, giving the golden fox enough time to swoop in and teleport Eiden away from danger.\"<br/>\"How exactly did the stillwater that you were fused with stop you?\" I say. \"Didn't you say before that he was supposed to be a weakling?\"<br/><br/>\"He was a weakling compared to myself or Eiden, but he was still stronger than every other stillwater in that war, and he was also an ethereal,\" Arraka says. \"The problem with ethereals is that their power gets multiplied exponentially while you fight them on the ethereal plane, especially inside their own mind. Therius may have been weaker than me on the earthen plane, but on the ethereal plane he was just strong enough to force a stalemate against me when I invaded his mind, and to cause our souls to fuse, instead of letting me absorb him. In practice, this meant that the two of us were forced to live inside his mind together for the duration of the still winter war, just like Flower and Illuna are doing now. Being of equal strength to me on that plane of existence, Therius was able to interfere with me on multiple occasions, including that one time when he saved Eiden from being killed, because they were apparently 'friends', or something. Not that their friendship really amounted to much when his old pal Eiden came back to murder us both, of course.\"<br/><br/>",

He wasn't using just loopholes anymore. He was essentially completely rewriting the rules of magic in increasingly more ridiculous ways all throughout the fight. It was an extremely frustrating experience, especially for someone as well-learned in the arts of magic such as myself.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure that he wasn't just using loopholes that you didn't know about at the time?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Of course I'm sure!\" Arraka says. \"Half of the things that he was doing in that fight were literally impossible. I'm honestly surprised that I even lasted as long as I did, considering how stupidly unfair that whole battle was.\"<br/><br/>\"But if what you're telling me is true, and Eiden really can bend the laws of magic for real, how could anyone hope to ever defeat him in his current state?\" I say.<br/><br/> \"I said that he 'could' bend the laws of magic at will, not that he still can,\" Arraka says. \"At this point in time, he probably only has access to a very small selection of tricks, compared to what he had during his last fight against me. My theory has always been that his unparalleled magical knowledge during that fight somehow came from the Magium, but more recently, after having seen how a Magium fragment possessed the Overseer and almost undid our whole universe in an attempt to hunt down the other Arraka, I think I might have finally figured out what happened all those years ago. My guess is that one of the Magium fragments somehow came into contact with Eiden and the fox at some point after my first fight against him, and it gave them access to forbidden knowledge, for the specific purpose of defeating me. Once their purpose was fulfilled, they must have lost most of their new knowledge, except for the small parts of it that they got to keep as a reward for their cooperation. That is why they were able to invent a spell that creates food out of nothing, which normally should have been impossible by using only the knowledge available at the time.\"<br/><br/> \"So, you're saying that there's still a chance, then?\" I ask her. \"Eiden can still be beaten?\"<br/>\"Why are you so obsessed with finding ways to defeat Eiden?\" Arraka says. \"He has hardly shown any interest in fighting against you in the past. As long as you don't openly provoke him yourself or step on his toes somehow, I don't see why you would have to fight him before you leave Varathia.\"<br/><br/>",

These so-called 'knots' sounded very similar to the typical blockages that I would normally encounter when enchanting my transceivers to have a more powerful signal, except that I would always try to either find my way around them or eliminate them entirely, and I had never once thought that I had the option to simply untie them as if they were strings. As soon as I applied this process to my enchanting, everything became much easier.\"<br/><br/>\"...Flower, can you take me closer to Daren?\" Arraka says. \"I want to have a better look at this transceiver of his.\"<br/><br/>\"Umm, sure!\" Flower says, and then she does as Arraka asked.<br/><br/>Once her amulet is closer to the transceiver, Arraka spends about thirty seconds observing it in silence. Just as we were about to ask her what she's doing, Arraka finally speaks, in a very calm, but obviously restrained tone of voice.<br/><br/> \"Daren...\" Arraka says. \"Do you remember how on the very first day when we started your aura training, I told you that in order to contact the spirit from the magical plane that is linked to your aura, you would need to untangle the flow of your aura with your mind, and that then you would need to pull on the invisible string to get the spirit's attention?\"<br/>\"Mhm,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Correct me if I'm wrong,\" Arraka says, \"but from what you told me in the past, your main problem was that you couldn't identify the string that was linking you to your spirit. You said that even after the goblin Kelrim finally got you to understand what I meant by untangling the flow of your aura, you still couldn't complete your task because you would have no way of knowing how to isolate the strings well enough to be able to analyze them individually. Were these not your exact words?\" <br/><br/>\"That is what I said, yes,\" Daren responds to her.<br/><br/>\"Then would you mind explaining to me why this device, created by you, is able to perform the exact task which you said was impossible for you to do?\" Arraka asks, sounding as if she were barely able to contain her anger.<br/><br/>",

The transceiver is an object, which means that as an enchanter, I can use my enchanting tools on it to freely manipulate its aura in any way I see fit. Obviously, I've only learned this fact recently, after I found out that objects have auras, because until a week ago I was sure that I was just using my tools to cast enchantment spells on these items. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that I can't use my enchanting tools on myself, because I'm not an object, so analyzing my own aura in order to find the invisible string you are talking about still remains just as impossible to me as before.\"<br/>\"Then use your transceiver, you bumbling imbecile!!!\" Arraka finally snaps. \"Do I really have to tell you everything?!\"<br/><br/>\"You want me to use my transceiver to... contact a magical spirit on another plane of existence?...\" Daren asks, confused.<br/><br/>\"YES!\" Arraka says. \"Just what kind of a moron are you? I can't believe that I've wasted so many hours of my life trying to explain all these abstract concepts to you when you could have easily done what I asked of you from the very beginning! If it wouldn't take me so long to conjure two physical hands from this amulet, I would strangle you to death on the spot!!!\"<br/><br/> \"You're not making any sense...\" Daren says. \"You told me that the only way to contact this spirit is through the link that exists between our two auras. How exactly is my transceiver supposed to help in this situation?\"<br/>\"You need to LINK it to your aura, genius,\" Arraka says. \"First you link your transceiver to your aura, then you rotate that dial of yours until you find the correct frequency, and once you've identified it, you use your enchanting tools to untangle the flow of the aura. I can't believe that I need to actually tell you how to do your own job.\"<br/><br/>\"If you knew that it was possible to do all this with a transceiver, then why didn't you just tell me?\" Daren says. \"It would have saved us both the trouble.\"<br/><br/>\"How was I supposed to know that this is how your transceiver works, you buffoon?\" Arraka says. \"I already told you once before that I couldn't have any less of an interest in tinkering with devices. Enchanting is the one type of magic that I know almost nothing about, because I never could be bothered to give a damn. There are no physical objects on the magical plane, so I had no idea that this branch of magic even existed until I was banished to this realm. You're the only one here who knew enchanting well enough to be able to figure it out!\"<br/><br/> \"Okay, fine,\" Daren says. \"Next time, I won't make the mistake to assume that you know what you're talking about. I've learned my lesson.\"<br/>\"Just shut up and get to work,\" Arraka says. \"If we're lucky, we might be able to contact that spirit of yours before it's time for you to go to sleep. The one good thing about all of this is that your transceiver will allow every one of us to talk to your spirit, not just you, so at least I'll be able to communicate with him directly. You'd better not mess this up.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, yeah,\" Daren says, as he is now getting his enchanting tools out of his backpack again, so he can work on his transceiver.<br/><br/>",

By the time she was finished telling me about the most basic spells in her repertoire, I had already filled ten pages of my notebook with all of the obscure and technical details she had given me.<br/>In the meantime, each of the other members of our team had kept themselves busy with individual trainings of their own, aside from Melindra, who still hadn't returned since this morning. As Arraka was just about to end her introductory lesson and move on to somewhat more advanced notions, we hear Daren calling out to us.<br/><br/>\"Guys, I think I did it!\" he says in a loud voice. \"Come over here for a second.\"<br/><br/>We all gather slowly around Daren, to see what he's talking about. Upon getting closer to him, I realize that the transceiver does indeed feel different from before. It's hard to describe exactly what is different about it, but if I were to try and put it into words, I'd say that the device seems to be perfectly in tune with Daren's aura, to the point where it reacts to his every movement, or even a slight change in his emotions or tone of voice.<br/><br/> When he sees that we are all close enough to hear him clearly, Daren takes the transceiver in his hand and then turns towards Arraka.<br/>\"The transceiver is linked to my aura now, and I've taken care of all the blockages that could obstruct the communications channel to the magical plane,\" Daren says. \"The only thing that remains to be seen is if the frequency that I set it to is correct.\"<br/><br/>\"There would have been no blockages to take care of if you hadn't chosen the correct frequency, so I doubt there's any way you could have gotten it wrong,\" Arraka says. \"Either way, we'll know for sure that it works as soon as we contact your spirit. Now hurry up and activate your transceiver! I'm curious to see which spirit you've been linked to, and whether I know them or not.\"<br/><br/>",

I remember that they came up with some very weak proof that only women of the civilized races could cast the spirit absorption spell and that there was an imminent danger that others like you could start popping up every second. The other spirits were so scared of your spell at the time that they bought their arguments easily, but I always did think there was something off about their explanation.\"<br/>\"Mhm...\" Arraka says. \"In fact, one of the main reasons why they needed to send the other females along with me is because Memphir didn't know of a way to banish me, specifically, from the magical plane. Believe it or not, as long as you know what you're doing, it is actually easier to tamper with the Magium to banish half of the spirits from the civilized races to another plane of existence than it is to single out just one spirit and send that one to the earthen plane. You only need access to a tremendous amount of energy, which was provided of course by all of the idiotic spirits that they were able to con.\"<br/><br/>\"If what you say is true, then this information may well turn our whole world on its head...\" Jirinn says. \"The war that would be started because of this could cost thousands of lives. Maybe tens of thousands. Is this what you are after? Do you want us all to kill each other for your entertainment, because you are no longer here to do it yourself? Why do you think I would agree to be part of such a scheme?\"<br/><br/> \"Don't be like that, Jirinn...\" Arraka says. \"If you were any other spirit, I would preach to you about the injustice of all the female spirits that have essentially been sentenced to death for the wrong reasons, but you and I both know what you really want. You want there to be chaos just as much as I do. Maybe even more than me. Isn't that the real reason why you founded your little group of 'enlightened' warriors? At first, you were fighting against the gods, but when I began my rampage, you immediately switched targets and began going after me. Now, you may have fooled the others into thinking that you were doing this for the right reasons, but I think you know very well that this was never the case. The real reason why you wanted to hunt me down was because you liked the challenge of it. You were only fighting the gods initially because you perceived it as a hopeless battle, but when I showed up, you immediately recognized my strength and decided to oppose me instead. Tell me, what have you been doing these last few thousands of years? Have you ever managed to recreate the feeling that you got when you were fighting against me and my allies? Has there ever been a moment when you have felt more alive than then?\"<br/>\"...No,\" Jirinn says. \"After your banishment, I did go back to fighting the gods, together with my enlightened warriors, but as you say, it was never quite the same. Eventually, my group disbanded and in the following years the gods gained more influence than ever. There is hardly anyone left who challenges their supremacy now, and even for someone as me, it would be nothing short of suicidal to openly oppose them at this point.\"<br/><br/> \"You see?\" Arraka says. \"That is exactly what I was talking about. What you are now is only a hollow shell of your former self. What I am granting you is the opportunity to go back to your days of glory. As soon as you will let everyone know the truth, there will be a great divide forming between the gods' factions. This will make them weak, and it will provide you with the much awaited chance to reorganize your enlightened group, and to once again become a force to be reckoned with. Think about it. Is this not what you've been looking for your entire life?\"<br/>\"You are still as shrewd as ever, I see,\" Jirinn says. \"At least I know that all those years spent on the earthen plane did not make you any less cunning. Hmm... I will have to think about what you told me... You will provide me, of course, with undeniable evidence to support your claims?\"<br/><br/>\"Naturally,\" Arraka says. \"I even met Selkram a week and a half ago, so I can personally confirm that the spirits are indeed still absorbed by him. Verifying this fact will be trivial.\"<br/><br/>\"You met with Selkram?...\" Jirinn asks. \"How?\"<br/><br/>\"He materializes on the earthen plane for a short while every time when he does his rituals,\" Arraka says. \"That's how I was able to speak to him. Anyway, before I give you all the details that you need, I have one additional matter to discuss with you. It is about the human who is linked to you.

Can you tell me what the medicine was meant to do, exactly?\"<br/>\"I don't know if this means anything to you,\" Illuna says, \"but Flower told me that the purpose of the medicine was to align the spinning essence with the spiraling blob.

Do you remember how a long time ago, after the gods began to heavily involve themselves with the people of the earthen plane, we began to borrow their time measurement units, like days, hours, minutes and years? Well, a full day is measured as the time between two sun rises, and a year is the time that it takes the large spherical earthen object that we are currently standing on to rotate around the sun. Or at least that's my theory around it. Most people here seem to think that the sun is the one rotating around us and that the earth we are standing on is just one long flat surface, so I try not to discuss this topic with them in order to preserve my sanity.\"<br/>\"Hey, Daren, did you hear that?\" Hadrik says. \"Arraka thinks that we're standing on top of some big sphere that spins around the sun. HAHAHAHAHA!\"<br/><br/>\"See, this is exactly why I don't talk to them about such things,\" Arraka tells Jirinn, while Hadrik is still laughing loudly in the background. \"It's a complete waste of my time and energy.\"<br/><br/>\"You seem to be on quite friendly terms with these... humans,\" Jirinn says. \"The Arraka I knew would have never been joking around with earthen creatures or asked a former enemy for help on their behalf.

Once I've given you all the details that you need regarding my soul absorption technique, we'll leave you alone, and then we'll contact you again in a day or two, so you can give us some update on your progress concerning the matters that we've discussed. Hopefully, it will be only good news. Oh, and make sure that you don't let anyone know of the fact that we've been in contact with each other. I don't want any of the gods to know that I'm the one secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes.\"<br/>\"Right,\" Jirinn says. \"Let's hear those details, then. I'm all ears.\"<br/><br/>For the next twenty minutes or so, Arraka gives Jirinn a very thorough explanation on how the soul absorption process works, and why the wrong application of her technique can lead someone to permanently speak in multiple voices, as is the case for Selkram and Ulruk. She then also takes the time to teach him how to use the same basic version of her technique that she taught the banshees on the earthen plane, so that he can properly understand what she's talking about.<br/><br/> Once Arraka makes sure that Jirinn has been given enough evidence to believe her side of the story, she begins to discuss with him a very elaborate plan on how to expose the God of Death and the God of Time in front of all the other gods, in a way that would make it obvious for everyone that they have absorbed spirits in the past.<br/>According to her, there is a way to temporarily awaken the spirits absorbed by Selkram and Ulruk from their long hibernation, but it can only be done for a very brief period of time, so it is important that there are as many witnesses as possible at that given moment.<br/><br/>In order to bring all of the gods together, Jirinn has agreed to contact them tonight and to falsely claim that he wants to pledge his loyalty to them tomorrow, before noon. Considering that he is the former leader of the largest and most powerful group that have opposed the gods in the past, such an offer will be hard for them to refuse, since his surrender would most likely greatly demoralize any spirits who still had any thoughts of resisting the gods' rule.<br/><br/> In fact, the gods will almost certainly use this opportunity to invite as many spirits as possible, so they can make a public showing of Jirinn's humiliation. Once all the spirits are gathered together and Jirinn has their undivided attention, he will cast a soul awakening spell provided to him by Arraka, causing Selkram and Ulruk's absorbed spirits to cry out desperately for help in their old voices, so that anyone who personally knew them five thousand years ago would recognize them immediately.<br/>Taking advantage of the ensuing chaos, Jirinn would then shout about how the gods have betrayed them, and how they have been secretly absorbing spirits to increase their powers for all these years. He would also then claim that the true reason why they banished Arraka and the other females of the civilized races was because they were afraid that they could become powerful enough to challenge their rule, and because they wanted to keep the soul absorption technique a secret, so that they alone would be able to use it.<br/><br/>",

So what happens to all the other female spirits who get born into this world and don't know how to possess people?\"<br/><br/>\"They die,\" Arraka answers him, simply.<br/><br/>\"But... you said that a part of the Magium is in charge of creating new spirits to balance out the ones who die, didn't you?\" Hadrik says. \"Does this mean that there are thousands of female spirits that are just reborn every day only to die over and over again? And this has been going on for five thousand years?\"<br/><br/> \"Sort of,\" Arraka says. \"First of all, they are not 'reborn' in the true sense of the word, since the new banshees that get created do not have the memories of the old ones that died. Secondly, the spirits do not die immediately after they are brought into this world. They usually fly around aimlessly for a few days at least before they inevitably succumb to their deaths. They don't have bodies, voices, or any real means to communicate with anyone from the earthen realm, but sometimes their presence is felt by certain people, who see them in their dreams or who can make out their shapes late at night. These spectral apparitions are typically referred to as ghosts. Oh, and it's not 'thousands' of female spirits that are reincarnated every day only to die, but rather tens of thousands, or even more than that.\"<br/>\"Tens of thousands?!\" Hadrik asks, shocked. \"And you are okay with this?\"<br/><br/>\"What is there to be okay with?\" Arraka says. \"I gave them a fighting chance, didn't I? I taught them how to survive. Now, the rest is up to them. And besides, it's not like I could have done much more for them even if I wanted to. I was trapped in a mountain for more than four thousand years, remember?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes, but you said that you've been roaming free in animal bodies ever since the still winter and until you got trapped in the amulet twenty years ago,\" Hadrik says. \"That's what... six hundred years, almost? You could have helped them during this time!\"<br/>\"Help them to do what, exactly?\" Arraka asks. \"Kill all of your women and steal their bodies? You do realize that even with my soul absorption technique, someone still needs to die, right? With the exception of ethereals, it is not possible for a banshee's and her host's souls to live together inside the same mind. If anything, you should be thankful that I didn't teach more female spirits my soul absorption technique. Right now, the number of banshees in your world is very small, so they are still manageable due to the existence of banshee hunters, but if every single female spirit were to acquire a body, they would quickly drive your whole population into extinction. This could have been amusing for a while, sure, but a world that has been emptied of all its locals would likely get boring very quickly.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Hahahaha!\" Hadrik laughs. \"So, this is what the healer in armor is like when all of his limitations have been removed! I've been dreaming of a moment such as this. The moment when I could finally test my powers against a world-renowned hero who is able to fight me at his full strength. How about it, Daren? Would you be interested in ditching this training session and going for a full-on sparring match instead?\"<br/>\"I was actually going to ask you the same thing,\" Daren says. \"Just give me a minute, so I can get out of this armor.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" Hadrik says. \"This should be interesting!\"<br/><br/>It takes him about two minutes or so, but with a little help from us, Daren manages to take all the pieces of his plate armor off, leaving himself dressed only in a short-sleeved dark-green tunic that he was wearing underneath, a pair of brown pants and his boots. Once everything has been prepared and the rest of us are out of the way, the fight can finally begin.<br/><br/>The first thing that Hadrik does is to dash straight for Daren, to see if he can overwhelm him with his inhuman speed. Normally, I would have expected Daren to use his newfound ability to block the dwarf's attack head on, but instead what he does is that he casually steps out of the way, even if he shouldn't have had any time to react to that without his reflexes somehow being magically enhanced.<br/><br/> \"You thought I wouldn't expect a surprise dash right at the beginning of the battle?\" Daren says, with half a grin. \"Come on, Hadrik! You know me better than that! I've been watching you fight for weeks. You're going to have to be a little more unpredictable if you actually want to win this.\"<br/>\"Hah!\" Hadrik says. \"I should have known that you wouldn't let me end the fight so quickly. But what if I do this?\"<br/><br/>He then jumps towards Daren, trying to hit him with his fist again, but Daren steps out of the way once more, making it look as if he were expecting this attack as well. Seeing that surprises don't seem to work on his opponent, Hadrik decides instead to strike many times in quick succession, in order to give Daren as little time as possible to outmaneuver him.<br/><br/>To all of our surprise, Daren's moves flow like water from one another, avoiding one punch after the other, without letting himself get hit even once. His new style of combat looks like a combination between the style of his old master Nolderan... and that of Eiden.<br/><br/>\"I see that Daren is combining his many years of combat experience with what I taught him about auras in order to read his opponent's moves and predict his attacks before they happen,\" Arraka says. \"Not bad. Maybe I didn't waste all that time teaching him for nothing.\"<br/><br/> After seeing that none of his attacks are connecting, Hadrik decides to change his strategy a little and to employ the same tactics that he used against Gontrok in their last battle, changing his body size and proportions constantly in order to confuse his dueling partner. From what I can tell, this does seem to be having an effect on Daren, likely because he hasn't really had the chance to see Hadrik fight in this new style for very long, making it a lot harder to predict. After a few very close calls, Daren is eventually forced to go on the defensive, blocking a lot more hits with his shield than he did before.<br/>On the other hand, Hadrik isn't letting Daren's sword get anywhere near him, knowing full-well that it could easily cut through his aura hardening and his tough giant skin even if Daren is not aiming for any of his weak points. This carefulness of his around Daren's weapon makes some of his strikes weaker than they should be, due to him being caught on the wrong footing half of the time.<br/><br/>\"It looks like it won't be long now until Daren concedes,\" Kate tells us.<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Flower says. \"Why would he give up? He's totally winning!\"<br/><br/>\"He looked like he was winning at first, but not anymore,\" Kate says. \"As soon as he started going on the defensive, the fight was lost for him.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me!\" Daren says. \"Hey, Hadrik, I've been wondering this for a while now, but that backpack of yours is not currently at its real size, is it? You once told me that you paid extra money on its enchantments so that it could hold hundreds of dwarven ale bottles inside it and prevent them from breaking, but even so, I can't imagine that any enchanter worth his salt would allow for so many items to be stored inside such a small backpack, since it would put way too much strain on it.\"<br/>\"You're right,\" Hadrik says. \"One of the backpack's enchantments makes it change its size along with me, as long as I wear it when I shapeshift. It's the same type of enchantment that I have on my clothes, armor and boots. In reality, the backpack's size is much bigger.\"<br/><br/>\"I knew it!\" Daren says. \"In that case, can you do me a favor? Would you mind changing your size temporarily, so I can fit my armor inside your backpack? It would be a real pain to have to strap all of these pieces to my backpack so I can carry them...\"<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Hadrik says. \"Well, the gnome king told me that I wouldn't be allowed to turn into a giant for the duration of this tournament, but I suppose that if I shapeshift into a slightly bigger size only for a short while, it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Alright, consider it done!\"<br/><br/>\"Thanks a lot!\" Daren says. \"This really takes a load off my mind. So... when are we leaving? Melindra, did you finish your negotiations with that friend of yours who has the pinecone detector? When can we meet them?\"<br/><br/> \"Umm, soon!\" Melindra says, looking a bit uncomfortable. \"Very soon! There are just... a few last-minute arrangements that I need to take care of, and then we'll be on our way.\"<br/>\"Right...\" Daren says, in a somewhat unconvinced tone. \"Well, take as much time as you need. Just make sure to not forget about the enchanter's oath. So far it hasn't been acting up in any way, but it might have some sort of negative reaction if the spell considers that you are stalling too much.\"<br/><br/>\"I know,\" Melindra says. \"I haven't forgotten. I'll... make sure that there are no unnecessary delays that could cause trouble with the spell.\"<br/><br/>\"As long as you understand, it's fine,\" Daren says. \"Anyway, we should hurry up and finish eating. To be honest, I'm still a little bit pissed about how my fight with Hadrik ended, so I'm kind of itching for a rematch.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, I offered a compromise, didn't I?\" Hadrik says. \"I said we could eat while still fighting. You're the one who surrendered out of the blue before we could talk things through!\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, yeah,\" Daren says. \"Whatever you say, Hadrik. Don't worry, this time there won't be any more interruptions, so I'm sure that we'll have a clear winner soon enough.\"<br/><br/> After we're all done eating, Daren and Hadrik both get ready to begin round two of their battle, like they said they would. However, just as they are about to start, a new spectator suddenly joins us, teleporting right next to our group, while acting as casually and nonchalantly as we've come to expect from him by now.<br/>\"What's the matter?\" Eiden asks us, with his eyes closed as always, after we all stare at him for a few seconds without saying anything. \"There's no need to stop the fight on my account. By all means, please continue!\"<br/><br/>\"Eiden again...\" Daren says, and then he sighs. \"I see that you're still walking around with your eyes closed, dressed in pajamas as if you've just gotten out of bed. Some things never really change, do they?\"<br/><br/>\"These aren't pajamas,\" Eiden says. \"They are high-quality fabric made from the finest of silks. They used to be quite popular six hundred years ago. Melindra, I'm surprised that you've travelled so long with them and you haven't told them this by now.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmph,\" Melindra says, as she crosses her arms and turns her face away from him, with a pout. \"I'm not talking to you.\"<br/><br/>\"Now, now, is that any way to treat an old friend?\" Eiden says, as he walks closer to her.<br/><br/>\"You're not my friend,\" Melindra says. \"Friends don't ignore each other in their time of need. You even went as far as casting a silencing spell on me in the Thilias arena and making me look like an idiot when I was talking to you. Don't think that I'll ever forget that!\"<br/><br/>",
