We have someone that we'd like you to meet!\"<br/><br/>Kate had only just gotten out of her tent when Hadrik called out to her. It's now been almost an hour since Daren's old enchanting master made his appearance before us. As soon as we established that he did not come here with the intention to start a fight, we told him that Daren would wake up shortly, and we invited him to join us in a game of Met-Zek. <br/><br/>We spent the last hour playing cards, while Nolderan told us various stories from the years that he's spent teaching Daren martial arts and enchanting magic. The ex-sage agreed to play the game with its original rules, so he's already managed to empty a bottle of dwarven ale in the short time since he joined us. However, he appears to be holding his liquor about as well as Hadrik, since I'm not yet seeing any signs of him being drunk.<br/><br/>\"Who is this?\" Kate asks, as she approaches us cautiously.<br/><br/>\"Remember how Daren told us that his old master gave him his scar during a sparring session?\" Hadrik says. \"Well, this is the old master that he was talking about. His name is Nolderan, and he apparently came here to greet Daren, since he hasn't seen him in a long time.\"<br/><br/>\"Pleased to meet you, my lady,\" Nolderan says, as he takes a polite bow.<br/><br/> \"Save your pleasantries,\" Kate says. \"Why don't you say what you really mean? It's not like I'm making any effort to suppress my magical aura at this point. If you are indeed Daren's master, then you must also be the one who taught him to fight against banshees.\"<br/>\"You must be thinking of Daren's other master,\" Nolderan says. \"The white mage. We were both ex-sages, so I can see how you might make the confusion. I assure you that I have no qualms with any banshee. As long as you are trusted by these people, I see no reason why I should consider you my enemy.\"<br/><br/>\"She's not a real banshee, just so you know,\" Hadrik tells Nolderan. \"She's a woman mage.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" Nolderan says, while raising his eyebrows. \"Now, that is certainly something that you don't see every day.\"<br/><br/>\"How did you know that Daren would be here?\" Kate asks him.<br/><br/>\"I didn't know that he'd be in this general area,\" Nolderan says. \"I just happened to be close enough to sense his aura, so I decided to come and say 'Hello'.\"<br/><br/>\"You just 'happened' to be close enough?\" Kate says. \"So you were just wandering alone, by yourself, in the middle of the night?\"<br/><br/>\"Actually, my camp is not that far from here,\" Nolderan says. \"I volunteered to do some scouting of the surrounding areas, during my night shift, which is why I was doing a patrol around these parts. I do understand how this could look a little suspicious from your point of view, however.\"<br/><br/>",

What proof do you have that you are really one of his teachers, and not just some assassin, who was paid to kill him?\"<br/>\"Well, if you want proof, then you can ask Daren himself,\" Nolderan says. \"He is heading our way right now.\"<br/><br/>\"Master Nolderan?\" Daren says, shocked, as he approaches us. \"Is that really you? You look so old!\"<br/><br/>\"The first time we meet in more than ten years, and this is what you tell me?\" Nolderan says, with a grin, as he puts down his cards, and he gets up from the tree trunk, in order to greet his old pupil. \"Maybe if you paid me a visit every once in a while, you wouldn't have been so surprised at the sight of my gray hair.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry...\" Daren says. \"It's just that I've been so busy with--\"<br/><br/>\"With saving the world, yes, yes, I know,\" Nolderan says. \"You don't need to take everything so seriously all the time, boy. I was only joking. I know all about your adventures. Now stop being such a killjoy, and come give your old teacher a hug!\"<br/><br/>Nolderan then hugs Daren for a few seconds, while patting him hard on the back.<br/><br/> \"I see that you're still wearing that heavy plate armor of yours,\" Nolderan says, as he releases Daren. \"Don't you get tired of walking around like this? What's the use of all those fancy moves I taught you if you can't even do half of them due to the weight of your armor?\"<br/>\"I already told you,\" Daren says. \"The armor is the only reliable protection against physical damage that I have. I'm not throwing it away.\"<br/><br/>\"Who needs to have protection when you can just dodge your enemies' attacks?\" Nolderan says. \"Do I really need to give you a third scar before you learn your lesson for good?\"<br/><br/>\"Ugh...\" Daren says. \"Let's not start this discussion again. We only just got reunited after I don't even know how many years. Should we not be celebrating, instead of having a fight?\"<br/><br/>\"You're absolutely right, Daren!\" Nolderan says. \"Hold on, let me get another bottle of dwarven ale, so we can have a toast.\"<br/><br/>\"Dwarven ale?...\" Daren says. \"At this hour? You can't be serious! What if we get attacked?\"<br/><br/> \"Of course you would say that...\" Nolderan says. \"Well, in that case, I'll just clink these two bottles, and imagine that you're also drinking with me. Cheers, Daren!\"<br/>He then clinks two dwarven ale bottles, like he said he would, and he takes a long sip from one of them.<br/><br/>\"You're all welcome to join me in this toast, of course, if you want,\" Nolderan says, as he looks towards Hadrik, Kate and me. \"It's a celebration, after all!\"<br/><br/>",

Don't they hold a competition for it every year, in each of your continents?\"<br/>\"Are you by any chance from Varathia, little girl?\" Nolderan asks.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I was born here,\" Flower says. \"Why do you ask?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I suppose that would explain why you would ask such a question, then,\" Nolderan says. \"I'm guessing that you don't really get a lot of information about the outside world on this isolated continent, do you?\"<br/><br/>\"We do get some news, but it's not much...\" Flower says. \"Have the yearly sage competitions been cancelled in the last decade? Is that why you stopped competing in these tournaments?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, they're still holding the competitions,\" Nolderan says. \"It's because of the person who took the title away from me that I've given up on the hope of winning the sage title ever again...\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Flower says.<br/><br/> \"The current four sages are unlike any of the sages that have held the title in the last century,\" Daren says. \"They are in a league of their own. Usually, a sage would not hold a title for more than two or three years before being dethroned, but three of the four current sages have remained undefeated for more than a decade. Azarius, the Sage of the West has been a sage for more than thirty years. He is practically the face of the Western Continent at this point. You see his portrait drawn on newspapers almost every week. One would have expected him to grow weaker, with old age, but every year, he seems to get stronger, instead. I think that everyone is mostly seeing the yearly contests as a formality at this point, and they're all assuming that Azarius will keep holding the title until he dies of old age.\"<br/>\"I know that you really like Azarius, Daren, but you shouldn't talk only about him,\" Hadrik says. \"The other three sages may not have held their titles as long as him, but I'd say that their feats are equally impressive. Talmak, the Sage of the North, is regarded as the strongest earth elementalist of our time. All of the adversaries that he's had in the twelve years since he's inherited his title have been nowhere near his level of power. The only one who actually gave him a run for his money was the previous sage, but he's dead now, along with almost every other mage who dared to challenge Talmak to a fight, over the years. Then there's Selgurd. The elf. Oh man, don't even get me started on the elf...\"<br/><br/>\"Did he also keep his sage title for a long time?\" Flower asks.<br/><br/> \"No, but the sage before him did,\" Hadrik says. \"He was considered to be on par with the other three long reigning sages, and everyone thought that nobody would ever defeat him. And then comes this no-name elf out of nowhere, and he kills him just like that, in less than a minute. Nobody even knows how he did it. He just made an illusion, so nobody could see or hear what was happening in the arena, and when the illusion was over, the Sage of the East was just lying on the floor, lifeless, and the crowds went completely silent. This happened last year. An investigation has been started to figure out what exactly lead to the old sage's death, but no evidence has been found as of yet. The elf would not say what spell he used, but the common consensus is that he most likely used a mind affecting spell of some kind.\"<br/><br/>",

I know that it's a little hard to believe, but I've seen it with my own eyes, so I can confirm that it's true.\"<br/><br/>\"Interesting...\" Nolderan says. \"I always thought that those devices were nothing more than toys, but I guess that I was mistaken.

People started to think that I was just some washed up old man, and they gradually began to look for other enchanting and martial arts masters. There's no shortage of those in the Southern Continent, after all. So, when people stopped coming to me to teach them, I decided that my talents would be better used elsewhere. You see... when you're doing mercenary work, nobody is going to care about your reputation. They just need you to get the job done. It might not be the most ideal career, but it puts food on the table.\"<br/>\"I'm so sorry...\" Daren says. \"I did not know that it's been so rough for you in these past years. I should have at least left you a transceiver to keep in touch.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't be sorry,\" Nolderan says. \"We all have our ups and downs. It's the way of life.

To try and change our lives for the better?\"<br/><br/>\"Actually...\" Daren says. \"The reason why I came here is that--\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, not that I want to interrupt you or anything,\" Arraka says, \"but Illuna told me to let you all know when there are enemies trying to surround us, and it just so happens that this is exactly what's happening right now, as I speak.\"<br/><br/>\"Is it monsters again?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/> \"Yeah, monsters,\" Arraka says. \"More than there were last time. They're all suppressing their auras again, but I can recognize the orc and the two ogres that got away from us two days ago. They must have gone to get reinforcements. I don't sense the two goblins that bailed them out last time anymore, so they must be a lot more confident in their chances of winning this time around. I'm counting at least fifteen warriors and five mages. Actually no, make that seventeen warriors. Five of them are ogres, including the two from before. Twelve of them are orcs, including their captain with the flaming battleaxes. The five mages are a mixture of orcs and ogres, but there are no more goblins this time.\"<br/>\"Well, master,\" Daren tells Nolderan. \"I think this is the time for you to go. These monsters have come here to kill our group, specifically, so as long as you avoid them on your way back to your camp, they will most likely ignore you and focus on us. It's sad that this reunion had to be so short, but as long as we're both participating in this tournament, I'm sure that our paths will cross again.  Assuming that we'll survive this battle, that is...\"<br/><br/>",

The orc captain from our last battle is, however, nowhere to be seen.<br/>\"I'll take the ones on the left,\" Nolderan says, as he heads towards the monsters.<br/><br/>\"There are five orcs on the left,\" Daren says, while he starts following his old master into battle. \"I'm coming with you. Hadrik should be able to handle half of the warriors by himself without much trouble.\"<br/><br/>He then sees that Leila has remained behind, uncertain of what to do.<br/><br/>\"Leila, you should go help Hadrik,\" Daren says. \"Master Nolderan and I should be able to handle ourselves against five orcs.\"<br/><br/>Leila nods, and she goes towards the orcs on the right, along with Hadrik.<br/><br/>\"I'll go find the mages,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"No, wait,\" Daren says. \"We shouldn't risk splitting up. There might be traps waiting for us in the woods. We'll all go together, after we're done with the warriors.\"<br/><br/>\"Understood...\" Kate says.<br/><br/> Daren then heads into battle, along with his master, as Hadrik and Leila are getting ready to fight the monsters on the right side. The first one to engage the enemy is Hadrik. He punches right through the orcs' shield wall on the right, putting a large dent into one of the monsters' shields, while knocking its holder on his back. Then, he jumps high into the air, and he lands with his fist on a second orc, just as the monster raises his shield to protect himself. <br/>The sound made by Hadrik's fist hitting the metal shield resounded throughout the whole clearing, and immediately afterwards, we could hear the orc's scream, as his arm broke from all the pressure. While the warrior is still struggling to recover, Hadrik quickly grabs him by his feet, and he throws him into two of his comrades, which sends them all crashing to the ground.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Daren and Nolderan have both reached the orcs on the left, and now they're flanking them from two sides, forcing the monsters to give up on their shield wall and to focus on the adversaries in front of them. As Nolderan begins to fight, I can definitely see the resemblance between his fighting style, and the one that Daren is using. However, Nolderan's style seems to focus a lot more on not getting hit at all, while Daren often likes to parry blows, and to block them with his shield, while he fights.<br/><br/> One other thing I'm noticing is the incredible synchronization between the two of them. Even if they've been apart for more than ten years, you can clearly see that they know each other's moves by heart, and that they don't need to communicate their actions through words, in the heat of battle, because one will always know what the other is planning to do next. More than this, it seems that neither of them is hesitant in leaving their guard down, while the other is watching their back. It's clear that such a level of teamwork can only be achieved by warriors who have spent many years fighting together, side by side.<br/>\"Just like old times, eh, Daren?\" Nolderan says, after he slices the head of an orc clean off his shoulders.<br/><br/>\"Yes, I see that you're still as reckless as ever!\" Daren says, as he blocks one of the monsters' maces with his shield. \"I can't believe that you're still alive after all this time!\"<br/><br/>\"You may be saying this, but you are clearly enjoying the fight,\" Nolderan says, with a grin, as he dances away from one enemy, and prepares to engage another. \"Here's another reckless move for you, boy. Get ready!\"<br/><br/>",

Each of the creatures is ridden by an orc wearing regular leather armor, and holding either a long spear or a crossbow in their hands. Wyverns are smaller versions of dragons that have a body length of fifteen feet, with their wings spanning around twenty feet. They are far less intelligent than dragons, their scales are a lot less durable, and they cannot breathe fire, but other than that, their appearance is rather similar.  Once the wyvern riders realize that we've already spotted them, they slow down their descent, and they begin to circle around the skies, waiting for the right moment to strike.<br/>\"Flower, Illuna and I will take care of the wyverns,\" Kate says. \"The rest of you can't fly, so you won't be able to help us. I think you should all go and deal with the mages, before they call for more reinforcements.\"<br/><br/>\"Maybe you're right,\" Daren says. \"At least we've forced them to reveal the ace up their sleeve, so they shouldn't be able to surprise us with any more-- DAMN IT!!!\"<br/><br/>As Daren was finishing his sentence, a very large blue circle appeared on the ground, in the area surrounding us, and a dim blue light is now slowly starting to envelop us.<br/><br/>\"Get out of the summoning circle!\" Daren shouts. \"Get out, now!\"<br/><br/>",

They are far less intelligent than dragons, their scales are a lot less durable, and they cannot breathe fire, but other than that, their appearance is rather similar.

        "text": " We all rush out as fast as we can, and when we look back, we see that the blue light has filled the whole area above the circle, up to a height of nearly thirty feet, and it has gotten ten times brighter than before. Soon afterwards, the earth starts to tremble, and a very large creature gradually materializes itself from thin air, within the area that we just left, as the circle and the bright light fade away.<br/>Once we get a clear look at it, we realize that the creature which has been summoned by the dragon's mages is without a doubt, a red-eyed mammoth. Towering above us, at an impressive thirty feet of height, the creature is now staring at us, with its bright red eyes, as if it's still trying to decide whether it should attack us or not. Red-eyed mammoths are generally not known for their aggressive behavior, despite their menacing looks, but a summoned creature is forced to obey any order given by its masters, so it most likely won't be long until this creature will try to trample us all to death.<br/><br/>Mammoths, in general, are only slightly larger than elephants, and the only major difference between the two species, in terms of appearance, is the fact that mammoths have much larger tusks, and their skin is typically covered with wool. Red-eyed mammoths, on the other hand, are much larger, they can only be found on the Northern Continent, and they are notorious for their fierceness in battle, when they fight to protect their territory. Their skins are completely armored, being far more durable than elven steel, and when they fight, they use their trunks like huge mallets, to smash their enemies, while they use their tusks as spears, to impale any remaining survivors of their onslaught.<br/><br/> As the mammoth roars loudly, I can suddenly feel the presence of the orcs and ogres disappearing from the forest, due to them teleporting out of the area, just like last time.<br/>\"The mages and the captain are gone, by the way,\" Arraka says. \"Just thought I'd let you know.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, Arraka, we all know that,\" Illuna says. \"It's not like they took any effort to hide their auras anymore for the past minute. The mages were probably only brought here to summon this beast, and nothing else. Let's go deal with the wyverns, before anyone else shows up.\"<br/><br/>Flower then jumps into the air, and she propels herself upwards with her fire jets, as Kate jumps on a flying platform made of ice, while she creates an ice cage around herself, in order to make sure that she won't fall off.<br/><br/> \"You're going to have to deal with the mammoth yourselves, while we fight the wyverns,\" Kate says. \"Don't take any stupid risks.\"<br/>\"Easier said than done,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"We'll manage, don't worry,\" Nolderan says. \"There hasn't been a monster yet that Daren and I failed to defeat, while fighting together. You just go follow your banshee friend, and do what you need to do.\"<br/><br/>Kate nods, curtly, and then she lifts her cage into the air, following Illuna towards the wyvern riders. As Kate heads for the skies, the rest of us stand our ground, and we look at the mammoth, which has been notably silent since its roar from earlier. The creature is not moving at all, and it's simply staring at us, waiting for our move.<br/><br/>\"So...\" Hadrik says. \"Do you guys think that we should attack it, or?...\"<br/><br/>",

Let's try backing away, for now. With a little luck, maybe it won't attack us.\"<br/>\"Well...\" Hadrik says. \"You're the creature expert. Come on, everyone, let's back up a little.\"<br/><br/>We all take a few steps back, slowly, while keeping our eyes on the monster, and we try to observe its reaction. The mammoth keeps standing there, looking at us, for a while, and then all of a sudden, it begins to run towards us, in an attempt to trample us under its feet.<br/><br/>\"So much for that plan,\" Hadrik says. \"Get ready to fight!\"<br/><br/>The dwarf then dashes towards the creature, and he jumps up in the air, trying to punch it in the head. The mammoth, however, sees him coming, and it stops in its tracks, raising its trunk, so it can defend itself. As soon as Hadrik gets into the monster's range of attack, the mammoth swings its trunk at him from above, with incredible force, sending the dwarf crashing into the ground.<br/><br/> \"One hit from that trunk, and we're goners,\" Daren says, as he looks at the hole in the ground, made by Hadrik when he fell. \"I wouldn't recommend attacking the mammoth unless you're really confident in your evasion skills. Barry, neither of your weapons would be able to get through this creature's thick armored skin, so you'd better stay out of this. Leila, the enchantments on your daggers are a little better, so you could give it a shot, if you want to come with us.\"<br/>\"I'll come with you,\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"Good,\" Daren says. \"Let's hurry. I'm not sure how long Hadrik can keep the mammoth busy on his own.\"<br/><br/>As Daren, Nolderan and Leila head towards the mammoth, I suddenly remember that I came upon a page detailing the weaknesses of red-eyed mammoths in my notebook, while I was reading through my notes, for the arena. Should I go get the notebook? I'm certainly not going to be of much use out here, at this rate. Okay, it's settled. I'll go get the notebook.<br/><br/> I rush towards my tent, and once I reach it, I open up the zipper. On my way there, I couldn't help but notice that Melindra's tent had remained closed since the battle has started. There's no way that she didn't hear those loud horns from before, or the sounds from all the fighting. Which means that she's just pretending to still be asleep, so she doesn't have to give away the fact that she can't control the power of her wind magic. <br/>Whatever. I don't have time to think about her. I have other things to do right now.<br/><br/>I quickly step inside my tent, and I open my backpack. Then, I take out my notebook from it and I flip through the pages, until I reach the paragraphs about the mammoths. And finally, here is what I was looking for. The red-eyed mammoth section.

        "text": " Apparently, the mammoth's main weakness is at the very base of its trunk, on the underside. Unlike regular mammoths, this is where this type of creature has its nostrils, so that part is basically lacking any sort of armor. One good stab in that area should do some serious damage to the creature's airway, but I'm not sure how one would go about doing that, without getting smashed into the ground by the trunk.<br/>The mammoth's eyes are also a weakness, but the eyelids are pretty thick, so it would take quite some effort to get through them. The creature only needs to close its eyes to protect itself, so as far as weaknesses go, this one isn't all that useful.<br/><br/>I can't really find any other information that could help us in this situation, so I decide to place the notebook back inside my backpack, and then I exit the tent. Looking at the battleground, I see that the mammoth is still busy defending itself from Hadrik, while mostly ignoring the fact that Daren, Nolderan and Leila are all trying to cut through its thick skin, by slashing at its legs. There are a few more holes in the ground now than when I went inside my tent, but apparently this hasn't stopped Hadrik from jumping at the monster some more, and then getting smashed into the ground over and over.<br/><br/> What now, then?... Nobody except Hadrik would be able to reach high enough in order to attack the mammoth's eyes or its nostrils, but the dwarf seems to have his hands full at the moment. Kate, Flower and Illuna are still fighting the wyvern riders in the sky, so they won't be able to provide assistance. If only we had someone else who could fly in our team... Hold on, what am I saying? There is someone else.<br/>\"Hey, Melindra, can you hear me?\" I shout, while I look towards Melindra's tent.<br/><br/>I can see no movements inside the tent, or anything else that might confirm the fact that she's heard me. After a few more seconds of silence, I continue.<br/><br/>\"Okay, you don't need to answer me,\" I say. \"I just have a little favor to ask. Remember how you made us all fly over the wall of Thilias, with your wind magic? Well, I was thinking that maybe you might have a way to make me fly that would also give me some manner of control. You know, like some semi-intelligent air-currents that react to my movements or something. I've also had access to elementalist wind magic two times before, and I think it should be theoretically possible to cast such a spell. You've been practicing this type of magic for six hundred years, so surely you must know how to do something like this by now, right?\"<br/><br/>",

I knew that staying in this group was the right decision! There's just no running out of powerful enemies to fight, with you people!\"<br/><br/>\"That was quite the impressive combination you two had back there,\" Nolderan says. \"I did not know that any of you had the ability to fly.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, well if there's anything Barry excels at, it's resourcefulness!\" Hadrik says. \"He made that abundantly clear after somehow managing to wiggle his way out of the arena alive, against all odds.\"<br/><br/>\"An arena, you say?...\" Nolderan asks. <br/><br/> \"Oh, right, we didn't tell you about that,\" Hadrik says. \"Back in Thilias, we all had to fight in an arena event, and the owner of that arena really had it in for Barry and Leila. Or rather, he wanted to make them into the stars of the show. He literally threw everything he had at them, and they only had some weaklings as teammates, but they still managed to make it out victorious. We'll fill you in on the details later.\"<br/>\"I sure hope that the orc captain is not planning to teleport back with even more reinforcements...\" Daren says. \"We really need to find a way to stop them from escaping. Otherwise they'll just keep coming at us over and over, until we're completely worn out.\"<br/><br/>\"Or you could try to do a better job at hiding your tracks, from now on,\" Nolderan says. \"If they managed to find you for a second time, then you people probably left them a really obvious trail to follow.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, you're probably right...\" Daren says. \"Now that I think about it, the only way they could have found us this fast is if they teleported back to the location of our previous battle, and pursued our tracks all the way to our camp.\"<br/><br/>",

When he is just about done, I see a tent getting opened in the distance, as Melindra slowly comes out of it. Just as she exits the tent, I can feel the air currents around me fading away, until they disappear completely.<br/>\"Look who finally decided to show up...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Melindra!\" Flower shouts, as Melindra is already advancing towards us. \"Over here! You missed the fight! Also, Daren's old enchanting master came to visit. He's standing right here, next to me. His name is Nolderan.\"<br/><br/>\"Is this another member of your team, or?...\" Nolderan asks us.<br/><br/>Melindra overhears Nolderan's question, while she's still making our way towards us, and she answers it before any of us get a chance to say anything.<br/><br/>\"I am only a travelling maiden, looking to go back home to her sickly father,\" Melindra says, in a loud voice, while smiling politely. \"These brave warriors have offered to escort me to my hometown, and now I am travelling with them.\"<br/><br/>When she reaches our position, she extends her hand, towards Daren's old master, inviting him to kiss it.<br/><br/>\"Pleased to meet you!\" she says, still smiling.<br/><br/> \"Likewise, milady,\" Nolderan says, as he grabs her hand, kissing it softly, and then releases it. \"May I ask which way you are headed?\"<br/>\"Oh, it's just a small town,\" Melindra says. \"You probably haven't heard of it.\"<br/><br/>\"We are taking her to a city called Ollendor,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>Melindra frowns at him, when she sees how easily he's given away our destination, but it doesn't look like Daren noticed.<br/><br/>\"Ollendor?\" Nolderan says, surprised. \"We've actually passed that city on our way here! And it just so happens that I have a mage in my team that can cast teleportation magic. If you would come with me to my camp, I'm sure that I could convince him to teleport you to your destination, and you could save a few days from your journey. What do you say, Daren, would you like to meet my teammates?\"<br/><br/>\"I... suppose so...\" Daren says. \"But I'm not sure what the others have to say about this. Would everyone else also be okay with asking one of Nolderan's friends to teleport us to Ollendor?\"<br/><br/>",

They wanted to fix this issue by casting a white mage spell on me, which was supposed to help me by limiting the amount of energy I could use to power up each one of my spells. In theory, it could have worked, but I did not want to risk it, because a stillwater's aura is just too different from that of a normal mage, and you can't know what will happen. It could potentially be deadly for someone like me. I tried to explain this to them, but they wouldn't take me seriously. The bastards even tried to cast this spell on me while I was sleeping, without my permission. They may well have killed me, if I hadn't woken up to stop them!\"<br/>\"I really don't think that Daren would try to cast that spell on you while you're sleeping,\" I say. \"Especially if you explain to him why you think it might be risky for you...\"<br/><br/>\"Really?\" Melindra says. \"You guys practically forced me to take a deadly enchanter's oath, just so you'd agree to come along with me, and now you're expecting me to believe that you would suddenly be willing to prioritize my safety over your own, just because I'm asking you nicely?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I've known about your problem and the risk it poses to us for quite a while, haven't I?\" I say. \"And yet, I never told Daren or anyone else about any of this.\"<br/><br/><% if((locals.v_b2_ch10_traps || 0) == 0 && (locals.v_b2_ch10_toast || 0) == 1 && (locals.v_b2_ch9_drink || 0) == 1) {%> \"I suppose not...\" Melindra says, as she takes a small break to contemplate on my words. \"But I'd still rather keep the others from knowing, at least until we reach Ollendor.
