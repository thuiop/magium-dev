You wouldn't want to catch a cold right before the arena.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you...\" Leila writes, as she takes what I've given her, and then closes the door, in order to get changed.<br/><br/>",

It's just until your own clothes dry off. Come on, let's go inside. I want to tell you what I found out while reading my notebook.\"<br/><br/>We both enter her room, and I spend the next fifteen minutes telling her the most important parts about my findings. She listens closely to what I have to say, while taking a bite from the beef jerky I gave her, every so often. After I'm done talking, she puts the jerky on the bed, beside her, and she starts to write.<br/><br/>\"From what you're telling me,\" Leila writes, \"I understand that our biggest problem by far will be the troll, and his higher than average regeneration.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I tell her. \"It is already known that a troll can regenerate fast enough to not die from a wound to the heart, but a troll being able to survive with its head cut off is something that I didn't think was possible. I guess it goes to show how little we really know about regeneration in general. According to all the books I've read, any living being that's had its head severed from its body should not be able to live any longer, regardless of how high its regeneration is. The fact that the body could even regenerate its head contradicts our most basic knowledge about how a troll's body is supposed to work.\"<br/><br/> \"But the troll didn't regenerate his head,\" Leila writes. \"The head kept talking from the ground, and the body had to pick it back up.\"<br/>\"You're right!\" I say. \"This means that the link between the body and the head is somehow not broken, even after the two of them get separated. Maybe we can use this. If the troll is still using its head to see and hear even after it's been severed from the body, then maybe we can cut his head off, pick it up, and then blindfold it, or something, leaving his body defenseless!\"<br/><br/>\"I don't think that the troll would leave himself open like that again, in the arena,\" Leila writes. \"I used the element of surprise before, but now he knows how fast I am, and he won't let me cut his head off again so easily.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, the only way you can kill a regular troll,\" I say, \"is either by cutting its head off or by burning it alive. If cutting the head off is not an option, then the only alternative we have left is fire. That being said, getting access to any sort of flames will be next to impossible in the arena, and that troll is even wearing anti-magic armor, which gives him protection to fire. Even if we somehow manage to find a way to burn him, we'd first have to damage his armor badly enough that the magical protections on it would wear off.\"<br/><br/>\"Do you think we should talk about all this with the other members of our division?\" Leila writes. \"Maybe they could come up with some ideas.\"<br/><br/>",

The few spectators who came in late are now hurrying as fast as they can towards their seats, as the announcer is doing a few tests, to make sure that his voice magnifier is working properly. Soon, the constant murmur that could be heard throughout the arena slowly dies out, and the announcer takes a deep breath, preparing to officially announce the beginning of the arena event.<br/><br/>\"Welcome,\" the announcer says. \"Welcome to all! I don't think that there is any reason for me to make a lengthy introduction this time around. You all know why you're here. You came here because you were promised the event of the century, and we plan to deliver on that promise. Now, if it's alright with everyone, I would like to begin by announcing the rules.\"<br/><br/>The announcer waits for a few moments, in order to make sure that there are no objections, and then he continues to read from his notepad.<br/><br/> \"By the request of the arena's owner himself, mister Venard,\" the announcer says, \"today's event will follow the traditional rules, which had been used by his father before him and by the lessathi of old, before the still winter. As most of you may already know, this also means that if a gladiator breaks one of the rules, they will not be disqualified from participating any further, but they will become an undesirable. By becoming an undesirable, a gladiator will be forced to participate in an additional round after the official event ends, where they will need to fight all of the other remaining gladiators at once, in one final battle. Any gladiator who manages to give the finishing blow to an undesirable will get rewarded either with his freedom, or with a large sum of money, depending on their status in this arena. Other gladiators can of course refuse to participate in this final round, and undesirables can also choose to no longer participate in the regular rounds, once they have been pegged as rule breakers.\"<br/><br/>",

If a gladiator is caught using magic, if they try to kill their teammates, or if they attack any of the spectators, they will be executed on the spot. The undesirable rule only applies for the rules of the actual event. Moving on, the traditional rules of the arena state that the arena events must be divided into exactly three rounds. The first round, as I'm sure you've already been told, will be fought against a variety of mythical creatures that have never been used before in this arena. We do have a surprise for the second round, however. For this special occasion, instead of our reigning champion, I think you will be happy to learn that the warrior who will be joining us is none other than the relentless mercenary Velgos!\"<br/><br/>There is a loud murmur in the crowd when they hear the name of Velgos. From what I can tell, they seem excited about the prospect of watching him fight.<br/><br/>\"In the third round,\" the announcer says, \"the gladiators that survived the first two rounds will need to fight in a series of duels, to decide who will be the victors of this event. Some of the duels will have to be fought to the death, while others will be fought only until one of the fighters surrenders. The exact duels will be decided after the end of round two, when we will know exactly which of the fighters have survived. And now that we got all of the introductions out of the way, I believe it is finally time to get this event started. Is everyone ready?\"<br/><br/> The crowd bursts into loud cheers for a few seconds, and the announcer now raises his voice, in order to drown out all the loud noises.<br/>\"Then I will keep you waiting no longer,\" the announcer says. \"Let the event of the century commence!\"<br/><br/>One of the iron gates from the lower level of the amphitheater is now slowly getting raised, while the crowds keep cheering as loud as they can.<br/><br/>\"For the first round,\" the announcer says, \"divisions of fighters will be entering the arena one by one, in the order of their division's number.

The three warriors raise their swords for a few seconds, to signal their victory to the spectators, and then they head towards the other marauders, in order to help their team mates.<br/>\"Fall back!\" we hear the desperate shout of the gladiator who was observing the battlefield. \"Fall back, now!\"<br/><br/>The gladiators look up, but they have no time to react. It takes only a few seconds for the manticores that had been circling the skies all this time to dive down, to sink their claws into the warriors' chests, and then to soar back into the air, carrying their prey. <br/><br/>The screams of the gladiators silence the crowd completely, as the beasts fly higher and higher. Two of the gladiators dropped their swords from the pain, immediately after being attacked, but one of them managed to keep hold of his weapon, and he's now using it to stab his attacker in the underbelly. The manticore screams, and it drops the warrior, who falls to the ground and crushes his head against the hard soil. The other two gladiators are raised a bit higher by their attackers, but then they also get dropped to the ground, and they die on impact.<br/><br/>The remaining warriors are now finally starting to panic. Their leader was among the ones who died. Having lost the person who was giving them directions, the gladiators begin to break their formation, and the marauders take advantage of this by grabbing one of the warriors with their claws, while another marauder impales him with its tail. <br/><br/> As if all this wasn't enough, two more manticores are just now entering the fighting area from beyond the gate, and they're running fast towards the surviving gladiators. The observer gets killed first. He didn't seem to be very skilled in combat, and he got mauled in an instant. The other gladiators did not last much longer. The desert marauders and the manticores finally joined forces against them, and they couldn't stand a chance. <br/>At the end of the fight, the arena falls completely silent, except for the sounds of the manticores, feasting greedily from the carcasses of their hard earned prey.<br/><br/>\"By the gods...\" Bruce says, as he watches the battle's aftermath in horror, from beyond our iron grating.<br/><br/>\"It appears that not even our reigning champions could defeat these fearsome beasts,\" the announcer says. \"This does not look good for the following divisions. Is this event going to end in a bloodbath?\"<br/><br/>The iron gate for the second division is now getting raised. However, nobody seems to be coming out. After about ten seconds of silence, we hear a scream coming from their direction.<br/><br/>\"I'm not going out there!\" a man screams, at the top of his lungs. \"If you want to kill me, then kill me now! You saw what happened to those gladiators! We don't stand a chance!\"<br/><br/>\"You're going to march in there and fight,\" another man's voice says, \"or you'll be getting a death far worse than being eaten alive by a manticore.\"<br/><br/>\"No, please, have mercy!\" the other man shouts.<br/><br/>",

Both the crowd and the announcer fall completely silent, as they watch Hadrik walk calmly, and then stop in the middle of the arena, in order to chug down the last contents of his bottle.<br/><br/>\"Ah!\" Hadrik exclaims. \"There's nothing like a fine bottle of dwarven ale to raise your appetite before a battle!\"<br/><br/>He then starts turning his head around, as if he were looking for something. <br/><br/>\"Say, you wouldn't happen to have something that I could throw this empty bottle away in, would you?\" he shouts towards the announcer, as he shows him the empty bottle in his hand.<br/><br/>The announcer watches him, with a puzzled expression on his face, without saying anything.<br/><br/> \"You know, like a trash can, or a paper bag, or something, so I don't make a mess?\" Hadrik says.<br/>The announcer and the crowd watch the dwarf silently, unable to decide whether he is being serious or not. While Hadrik was talking, one of the scorpion-like creatures was slowly creeping up behind him, and aiming to attack him with its claws.<br/><br/>\"You know what, never mind!\" Hadrik says. \"I'll just use this as an improvised weapon, instead.\"<br/><br/>He then immediately turns around, and he clobbers the desert marauder in the head with his bottle, which breaks into shards of glass that stab the creature in its eyes. The monster starts screaming in pain, as Hadrik makes a quick jump, landing with his fist on top of the marauder, and smashing it against the ground, causing a loud shockwave while also forming a small crater below the creature, due to the force of the impact. <br/><br/>One of the manticores that was still up in the sky quickly dives down to grab Hadrik in its claws, but the dwarf steps away at the exact moment when the monster reaches him, and he grabs it by the tail. He then spins it around for about four seconds, building momentum, and then he throws it at a wall far away from him with all his might, causing the beast to smash right through it with a loud booming noise.<br/><br/>The crowd and the announcer are both speechless.

You all better hang on to your seats, because the fun is just starting!\"<br/><br/>He then runs towards another marauder, and he headbutts it so fiercely that it drops to the ground in an instant.<br/><br/>\"Release the second wave!\" the announcer shouts, as a few more desert marauders come out of the large iron gates that had been opened previously.<br/><br/> Making their way from behind the marauders, a new species of creatures is now entering the fighting area. The creatures look like larger versions of porcupines, but from what I understand they should not be related to them in any way besides their looks. Unlike regular porcupines, the quills on their backs are deadly weapons, and they are sharp and durable enough to give elven steel a run for its money. The creatures have the ability to launch their quills as projectiles, with a very high accuracy and speed. Due to their high regeneration rate, they also have the ability to regrow their quills almost instantly. This provides them with a near unlimited stock of ammunition to use against their foes. Their appearance and their behavior have led people to call these creatures 'archer porcupines'.<br/>A few of the porcupines that have positioned themselves several dozen feet behind Hadrik are now turning their backs towards him, getting ready to attack. Hadrik is still fighting the marauders, and he doesn't seem to have noticed the porcupines. Should I shout a warning to him? I wouldn't want to distract him in the middle of his battle, but if those porcupines manage to aim their shots right, he might be in trouble.<br/><br/>",

They must have been placed there to give people who didn't have any weapons when they got captured an equal chance in the fighting event. Hadrik mumbles something under his breath, and he goes to get one of the spears. He then tosses it at one of the manticores, and the spear lodges itself into its chest, causing blood to spray out while the creature falls towards the ground.

He knows what he's doing.<br/>While Hadrik sends the last of the marauders crashing to the ground, three of the archer porcupines aim their shots towards him, and six of their sharp quills stick themselves into the dwarf's back.<br/><br/>\"Huh,\" Hadrik says, with the tone of a man who's just been bitten by a mosquito.<br/><br/>He then takes all of the quills out one by one with his hands and he throws them on the ground. The quills seem to have barely gotten through his skin, and there is hardly any blood coming out of the wounds. I don't know why I'm surprised. If regular unenchanted elven steel is not sharp enough to pass through a giant's skin, then why would it be any different for porcupine quills?<br/><br/>Hadrik does not give the archer porcupines the chance to aim their second shot, as he dashes towards them, and then pummels them repeatedly with his fists until they're all either dead, or unable to move.<br/><br/>The manticores have all abandoned their meals when Hadrik started his rampage, and they're now back to circling the skies, trying to find the right time to strike. One of the braver manticores dives down quickly, in an attempt to surprise the dwarf, but when it sees him react, the monster quickly soars back up into the sky, and out of his reach.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Hadrik says. \"Come back here, you coward!

Today, he will be participating in our arena event as our special guest.

You all saw how they operated. One guy was the leader, another one was staying behind, to warn them of danger, some of them were decoys, and others were the main fighters. If we did that too, we'd be a lot more organized.\"<br/><br/>",

As soon as one of the tramplers comes within reach of his blade, he steps to the side, and he cuts off the beast's head in one single motion, causing the trampler's headless body to fall on the ground and to keep sliding forward on its belly for a few more feet, until its momentum is finally gone.<br/><br/> \"Gods be damned,\" I hear Bruce shout behind me. \"Why won't you listen to me?
