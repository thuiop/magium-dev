        "text": " As Gontrok gets closer and closer, we all eventually stop talking while a feeling of tenseness and uncertainty gradually begins to fill the air around us. Hadrik is now putting some distance between him and us, in order to make sure that we won't be caught in the crossfire when the two shapeshifted giants begin exchanging blows. The next twenty seconds of waiting feel almost like an eternity. <br/>When Gontrok finally enters our line of sight, Hadrik plants his feet into the ground and he puts his guard up, bracing himself for impact. Without showing any signs of slowing down, Gontrok keeps charging towards us, lining himself up with Hadrik until he arrives about two dozen feet in front of him. He then suddenly accelerates, travelling the remaining distance between the two of them in the blink of an eye, while readying his fist to strike as hard as he can.<br/><br/>Hadrik blocks the punch with both his forearms, but the impact of the hit is still strong enough to send him flying a few feet backwards. When he sees his enemy successfully landing on his feet after the first attack, Gontrok stops to give Hadrik a malicious grin before he begins to talk.<br/><br/>\"I've been looking forward to this!\" Gontrok says. \"I hope you're ready for our rematch, Hadrik.\"<br/><br/> \"More ready than you think,\" Hadrik says.<br/>\"Well, in that case, let's see what you-- hold on a minute, there... I recognize that goblin!\" Gontrok says, as he points towards Kelrim. \"I've seen him with the rebels. And if you people are travelling with him now, then that means...\"<br/><br/>As Gontrok figures out what's going on, his face gradually lights up with joy.<br/><br/>\"Hah! I knew it!\" he says in a loud voice, making sure that we can all hear him properly. \"You were hiding under the city this whole time, weren't you? That's why we couldn't find you! You were being sheltered by the so-called 'king of the underground' and his merry men. I\u2019ve been telling the real king for a long time that these underground dwellers were traitors and needed to be eliminated, but the captain would always find a way to defend his old disciple and to claim that this underground society somehow didn't pose a threat to us. Oh, I can't wait to see how he'll defend them now!\"<br/><br/>",

First the rebels and now you. It's clear that this king of the underground is working against the best interests of Ollendor, and I'll make sure that he gets punished for it.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, Gontrok,\" Hadrik says. \"Do you really think you have the luxury to talk to other people after you challenged me to a battle?\"<br/><br/>\"Be serious,\" Gontrok says. \"You know full well that I'm only toying with you.

As Gontrok jumps sideways to put some distance between the two of them, Hadrik follows him and he changes his size to that of a human again. This time, Gontrok was expecting it and he tries to hit him in the bridge of his nose, but what he gets to punch is empty air, because Hadrik once again switches back to his dwarf form and he kicks his opponent in the shin.<br/><br/> For the next half of a minute or so, Hadrik keeps changing his size constantly while fighting, in order to make sure that his enemy is as confused as possible. As expected, Gontrok looks like he's having a really hard time adapting to such an unusual fighting style, and for the first time since we've met him, it seems like he is now fully on the defensive, without even attempting to land a hit anymore. After sustaining a few more injuries, Gontrok realizes that he needs to regain control of the battle, so he shapeshifts only his back into that of an archer porcupine, and then he turns around, sending a few of the quills flying towards Hadrik at a much higher speed than what I've witnessed from the porcupines in the arena of Thilias.<br/>As Hadrik dodges the first few projectiles, Gontrok sends more of them his way, forcing his enemy to gradually back away from him, in order to give himself a bit of time to catch his breath.<br/><br/>",

I was beginning to worry that all those years you've spent masquerading as a dwarf had turned you soft. Now I can tell your parents that their pathetic son has at least not completely lost his honor. Not that they would care much, of course. Most of the times when I talk to them about you, they like to pretend that you don't even exist.\"<br/>\"Shut your mouth and continue the fight, Gontrok--\" Hadrik says, but he is interrupted.<br/><br/>\"Was it worth it, Hadrik?!\" Gontrok shouts loudly, in order to drown out Hadrik's voice. \"Was it worth it to leave your homeland behind, along with all of your friends and family, just because of what happened to an insignificant dwarf village?\"<br/><br/>\"Dwarf,\" Arraka says. \"I swear... if I see you losing your cool again over this...\"<br/><br/>\"I get it,\" Hadrik tells her in a calm tone, even though it's clear that he is barely able to contain his anger.<br/><br/> \"What did you even hope to accomplish by travelling through the dwarven lands in the shape of a dwarf?\" Gontrok asks Hadrik, while ignoring Arraka. \"Were you trying to atone for your sins? Did you think that you'd somehow make things right after killing all those dwarf women and children by going to put flowers on their graves or something? Face it, Hadrik, you are a murderer, like the rest of us. The only difference between you and me is that I am not an honorless dog like you, and I can live with killing a few civilians during a war without turning into a complete coward.\"<br/>\"Dwarf,\" Arraka says. \"If you let him get under your skin again, I swear I am going to rip out your spine and--\"<br/><br/>\"I said I get it!\" Hadrik shouts loudly, as he rushes furiously towards Gontrok.<br/><br/>When Gontrok tries to block his opponent's first hit, Hadrik shapeshifts himself into the size of a leprechaun, sliding between Gontrok's legs and arriving behind him. Then, he almost instantly turns back into human size, grabbing Gontrok's head from behind and pushing it hard into the ground. As he is now holding Gontrok's head against the pavement with his left hand, Hadrik goes for the finishing blow, attempting to punch him as hard as he can with his right fist in the back of the head.<br/><br/> What happens instead is that Hadrik's fist hits a small, semi-transparent barrier right above Gontrok's head, which appeared seemingly out of nowhere. Gontrok takes advantage of the confusion Hadrik is in to escape his grasp and to jump backwards, and once he is safely out of his old friend's reach he begins staring at a narrow alleyway to our right, with a reproachful look in his eyes.<br/>\"Your help was unnecessary, captain,\" Gontrok says.<br/><br/>\"Was it, really?\" we hear the voice of the captain of the guards, as he is now slowly revealing himself. \"It most certainly didn't look like you had things under control from where I was standing, recruit.\"<br/><br/>\"Have you been watching us this whole time?\" Gontrok says.<br/><br/>\"I've been watching enough of this fight to know that you're out of your league, Gontrok,\" the captain says. \"I did not want to interrupt you at first, because you tend to react badly when people interfere with your duels, but after seeing your abysmal performance just now, I've concluded that I've already let you waste enough of my time as it is. Get out of the way, Gontrok. The rest of us will take it from here.\"<br/><br/>As Gontrok looks like he is simply boiling with rage, the other royal guards are now approaching us one by one, from every direction.<br/><br/>",

Your role in this fight is over. We will dispose of these criminals in a matter of seconds, so you can just stand there and watch.\"<br/><br/>Right after the captain is done talking, an immense pressure pushes us all to the ground, immobilizing us in an instant. As I'm hearing some noises above me, I struggle to raise my head so I can see what's going on. Apparently, in the short time when I wasn't looking, the sky had been filled with large rocks that are floating in the air, just waiting to be dropped on us.<br/><br/>A few seconds later, the earth elementalist who is controlling the rocks decides to throw some of them into us, while we are still being pinned against the ground. Before they reach us, Daren raises his sword in the air and moves it to the side, which immediately breaks the effect of the captain's aura manipulation technique.<br/><br/> With no time to waste, Kate conjures a floating shield made of reinforced ice over our heads, while Hadrik makes a high jump and he smashes the biggest of the boulders heading towards us into small pieces. Some of the rocks break through Kate's ice, but we manage to move away from them and to avoid getting hit.<br/>\"Hahaha!\" Gontrok laughs. \"What's the matter, captain?

Warning!\" says the green-eyed drone that was apparently still following me. \"A non-combat unit is being under attack. Requesting backup immediately.\"<br/><br/>\"What the hell?...\" the air elementalist elf says, as he temporarily stops sending wind blades my way to look at the sky.<br/><br/>Several red-eyed drones are now rapidly descending towards us, and their target seems to be the air elementalist in front of me.<br/><br/>\"Get away from me, you idiotic machines!\" the elf says, as he sends some of his blades of air at the metal balls, but his attacks are easily dodged by them.<br/><br/>\"Now's our chance,\" I say to Leila and Daren. \"Let's rush him while he's being distracted!\"<br/><br/>Right after saying this, a large hydra with six heads, made entirely of wind appears in front of us, blocking our way towards the air elementalist. Even though the monster is technically made of air, we can still tell that it's supposed to be a hydra because of the way the sun's light is reflecting from its surface. Seeing the huge creature in front of us, Daren and I both stop but Leila just keeps sprinting ahead, straight through the hydra while heading directly for the elf. <br/><br/> Being too focused on the drones to notice her, the air elementalist only realizes that he was being flanked when he gets stabbed with one of Leila's daggers through the back of the throat. Once Leila removes her dagger, the elf puts his hand on his neck, trying to stop the flow of blood but there's just too much of it pouring out for him to be able to do anything. Not long afterwards, the elf loses the strength from his legs and he falls flat on the ground, with nothing left to do but to slowly bleed out and die.<br/>\"How did you know that the hydra wouldn't attack you?\" Daren asks Leila, as the creature made of air is now fading away.<br/><br/>\"I didn't,\" Leila writes, as she is now coming back, \"but the elf wasn't paying attention to us when the hydra appeared, and he didn't do any gestures that would make me believe he was the one who cast that spell, so I figured that the chances were high for this to be simply an illusion made by some other mage to scare us away.\"<br/><br/>\"Nicely done!\" I say. \"And that was a nice assist from you too, Overseer. I didn't think keeping you around would actually turn out to be helpful.\"<br/><br/>\"Does this mean you are now satisfied with the quality of your interactions with the Overseer protocol?\" the Overseer says.<br/><br/> \"What?\" I say. \"Oh, uhm... sure, I guess...\"<br/>\"Your previously given rating of zero has been updated to a rating of five out of five,\" the Overseer says. \"Thank you for your input. The answer to the second question of the survey will no longer be necessary. Have a nice day!\"<br/><br/>Having said this, the green-eyed drone finally decides to stop following me, and it proceeds to fly up into the sky, along with all of the red-eyed drones that came to its defense.<br/><br/>As I am standing there, looking at the metal balls flying away from me, I notice Loyrang with the corner of my eye, who seems rather bored of this whole situation and who has given no sign of wanting to attack us so far.<br/><br/>\"Hey, so, uhm... here's a quick question...\" I tell him. \"Are you going to be a part of this fight or not?\"<br/><br/>\"Only if you force me to,\" Loyrang answers me.<br/><br/>\"Fair enough,\" I say.<br/><br/>As we are trying to decide what to do next, the man in black robes that ambushed us yesterday suddenly teleports behind Kate, attempting to stab her with a knife.<br/><br/>",

It appears that the hydra is not planning to follow us, but it also won't let us get anywhere near the elf.

Shall we teleport back to the base?\"<br/><br/>\"I'd say it's about time, yes,\" Albert says, as he finally cancels his invisibility spell and reveals himself to now be standing right next to us.<br/><br/>\"Nice timing, Albert!\" I say. \"You sure were a lot of help back there, when we most needed you!\"<br/><br/>\"Spare me your sarcasm,\" Albert says. \"I said that I'd help you and I did. I killed the black-robed royal guard, didn't I? Surely, you weren't expecting me to kill all of the guards myself?\"<br/><br/>\"No, but it sure would have been nice if you had at least tried to attack the captain while he was crushing us to death,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"The captain had a keen enough magical sense that I couldn't get anywhere near him without being detected,\" Albert says. \"Trust me, if that weren't the case, I would have assassinated him a long time ago.
