"Okay, Melindra," Daren says, after we all retreat back into the forest so we can have another strategy meeting. "I think now would be a good time for you to tell us everything you know about Ollendor's defenses. We're all ears."

"Good!" Melindra says. "Although, to be honest, I don't really know a lot more than you do. I haven't spent that much time in Ollendor, and it's been quite a few years since I was exiled from this continent, so a lot of things may have changed since then."

"Oh, right, I almost forgot that this was the reason why you wanted the king of Ollendor dead," Hadrik says. "What did you do to get yourself kicked out of Varathia, anyway? Didn't you say that you were born here?"

"That is... a personal matter," Melindra says. "I'd rather not talk about it, unless it's absolutely necessary."

"Hmm..." Daren says. "I still can't help but think that there's something important you're not telling us about your reason for coming back here. You don't seem like the kind of person who would go through all this trouble just for petty revenge. There has to be another reason why you would want to kill the king of this city."

"You're right," Melindra says. "There is another reason. In short, the king of Ollendor has stolen something very important from me, and I want it back. However, this isn't something that you should concern yourselves with. All you need to do is help me kill him. I will handle the rest by myself."

 "I see..." Daren says. "Well, as long as you uphold your end of the bargain, we will try not to meddle in your affairs, then. Whatever they are..."
"What about Ollendor's defenses?" Kate says. "Isn't there anything you remember that could be of use to us? Perhaps some obscure weaknesses that could help us fight those golems at least?"

"The only thing I know is that these technological advancements are all relatively recent," Melindra says. "A few decades ago, the king has allied himself with a rogue lessathi, and it is thanks to him that they've managed to turn those old lessathi ruins into something functional. Those metal golems that you saw outside were also designed by him. The reason why I wanted you to see them with your own eyes before making our plans to infiltrate the city was because I wanted you to take their defenses seriously. We can't afford to just smash through their front gates and fight our way through. We need to keep a low profile for as long as possible. That being said, we're almost definitely going to have to fight our way out after we assassinate their king, so you should also prepare yourselves mentally for our inevitable fight against those golems when we escape the city."

 "But how are we supposed to sneak past those golems if they're always patrolling outside the walls?" Daren asks. "Do they have worse vision at night or something?"
"No, but there's no need for us to sneak past them!" Melindra says. "We can just enter through their front gate the normal way. We'll say that you came here to trade some of your enchanted goods, and that the rest of us are your bodyguards or something. That should be enough of a reason for the guards at the entrance to let us in. And my exile was kept a secret from anyone but the king's most trusted advisors, so we shouldn't be worried about the guards not letting us in because of me."

"I think you may be forgetting the small matter of us killing the earl of Ollendor, back in Thilias," Hadrik says. "I know that we've technically served our sentence with that arena and that we have the papers from Golmyck to prove it, but something tells me that this won't really stop the king of this city from executing us for murdering his brother."

 "He won't execute you if he doesn't even know that his brother is dead, yet!" Melindra says. "Believe me, if the king knew about the earl's death, the whole town would be in mourning. Those walls would be covered in black banners, and there would be paintings of the earl's face placed on posters all around the small village outside the city. Considering how normal everything seems to be, I think it's safe to assume that the ambassador has not sent any of his emissaries to let the king know of his brother's death, and he wanted to tell him of this personally, when he got back. Except we got here first, since we took a shortcut through the monster-infested forests! It will probably be at least another day until the ambassador reaches the city the regular way, so until then, you'll be just some random tournament participants that shouldn't be raising any suspicion."

 "But will they let a bunch of armed strangers enter their city so easily?"
"Why not?" Melindra says. "From their point of view, most of you shouldn't even be able to hurt the locals because of the tournament's protection spell, remember? Since they didn't find out that you killed the king's brother yet, they won't know that you can bypass the protection spell's effects. They have no reason to fear you."

"Well, I guess Melindra's plan is worth a shot," Daren says. "She's the one that knows this city the best, after all. But remember to keep your guards up. If things get out of control, we might need to fight our way in, so you should all be ready for the worst case scenario. Melindra, is there anything else we should know before we begin heading towards the city?"

 "Yes," Melindra says. "You should tell the guard at the city gates that you were invited into Ollendor by someone from within. That way, they should let us in faster. If he asks who invited you, just tell him that your client wants to remain anonymous. Unless their security has gotten tighter over the years, this should be more than enough to gain us entrance into the city. Oh, and another thing! While we approach the city, we should all take care to talk in a low voice, so the people from the village can't hear us. Actually, it might be better if we didn't talk at all, unless it's absolutely necessary. The villagers and the city folk all live in fear of their mad king, and they would rat us out immediately if they found out our real reasons for wanting to infiltrate the city. Remember that we are inside enemy territory here. We can't afford to make any mistakes."
"Understood," Daren says. "Let's move on, then. When we reach the gates, I'll try to do most of the talking. Hopefully, everything will work out in our favor."

 After making sure that none of us had any better ideas for infiltrating Ollendor, we all walked out of the forest and headed for the main road that led towards the city gates. On each side of the road, we could see the wooden houses of all the peasants living outside the city, who were each busy working their fields. As we walked past the farmers, a few of them glanced shortly in our direction, but for the most part they didn't pay much attention to us and just kept going about their business. Looking at their faces, I couldn't help but notice that they had the same tired looks in their eyes as the orphans from the Beacon of Hope. It seemed as if they'd given up hope long ago and they had all resigned themselves to their fates, which were no longer in their hands.
We all followed Melindra's advice and we didn't talk amongst ourselves until we reached the gates. Once we arrived close to our destination, Daren stepped to the front so he could address the guard in front of the city's entrance.

 "What will we do if they don't buy our story?"
"Hmm..." Melindra says. "Well, it would be better if they thought Daren came here to do some trading, because merchants get preferential treatment in this city due to how rarely any of them bother to visit, but if they don't believe us, I suppose we're just going to have to enter the city the regular way. That would require a bit more paperwork, and it would take more time, but I doubt it can take THAT much longer, so I'm sure we'll be fine."

"Well, I guess Melindra's plan is worth a shot," Daren says. "She's the one that knows this city the best, after all. But remember to keep your guards up. If things get out of control, we might need to fight our way in, so you should all be ready for the worst case scenario.

 "Good morning!" Daren says in a loud tone, to make sure that the man in front of the gate could hear him. "Are you the one that I need to talk to in order to gain access inside the city?"
The guard doesn't answer him right away. He was sitting on a chair when we arrived, measuring us up and down with a rather unimpressed look on his face, and while Daren was talking, it looked as if the gate keeper was only paying attention to about half of what he was saying.

Daren waits patiently for the guard to slowly get up from his chair and to walk towards him, while two metal golems that were standing in front of the gate seemed to be studying us attentively.

"What business do you have here?" the guard asks, as he stops in front of Daren, eying him suspiciously.

"I've come to sell some goods," Daren says. "I'm not sure if you know who I am, but I am a very famous enchanter outside Varathia. Daren, the healer in armor is what they call me."

"Never heard of you," the guard says, in an uninterested tone.

 "Well, I can't blame you," Daren says. "This continent is pretty isolated from the rest of the world. Anyway, I have a client who wants to remain anonymous that would like to buy my wares, and I've arranged to meet them inside the city. Could you please open the gates to let me through?"
Again, the guard does not answer him immediately, and he just looks at him with a frown on his face, while he is continuously chewing on what seems to be some kind of plant. I say that he's frowning, although in reality it's a bit difficult to tell if he's genuinely upset about something or if that's just the way his eyebrows work, because I'm pretty sure that he's had them furrowed from before he even noticed us.

"What's the password?" the guard says, after a while.

"Password?..." Daren asks, confused.

"Aye," the guard says. "Password. If you were invited here by someone, then they must have given you a password. That is the only way in which you can enter the city without filing for the usual paperwork. So, what's the password, then?"

#if(v_b3_ch1_password == 1) {
 As the guard talks, I suddenly remember the text on that rock from Melindra's collection, which said that 'The password is griffin beak'. Could it be possible that it was referring to the password required to enter the city of Ollendor?

 "Uh, the guy we were supposed to meet didn't tell us about any passwords."
"I doubt it," the guard says. "Everyone in this city knows that you need a password to enter. If he really didn't give you a password, then it must mean that he didn't have any urgent need of the goods you are selling him, and he was fine with you filing for the required paperwork, like any other outsider."

 "And what do we need to do to file for these papers, exactly?" Daren says.
"For the moment, you don't need to do anything," the guard says. "I will send someone later today to obtain all the necessary permissions from the higher ups, and then we'll bring you some papers to sign. This usually takes a while, though. You could try checking back tomorrow, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. People rarely get their entrance papers earlier than three days after their arrival."

"Three days?!" Daren says, a little too loudly, but then he quickly calms himself down. "Oh... Alright. I understand. In that case, we'll be going back to our camp, and we will return tomorrow. Maybe we'll be lucky and there will be some news for us. Have a good day, and thanks for your help!"

The guard nods at Daren, and then we all head back towards the woods that we came from, without saying a word. It is only after we are safe away from all the villagers that Hadrik's voice suddenly explodes, as if the pressure had been building up constantly the whole time that he had to keep himself from talking.

"Three days!" Hadrik shouts. "Did you hear that guy?... The ambassador will have arrived three times by then! We may as well break through their front door right now! At least that way we'd get the element of surprise!"

 "Using brute force is our absolute last resort," Daren says. "Didn't you see those golems? Those are just one of their many defenses. Who knows what else they will be pulling out of their sleeves, while we try to fight our way to the palace. Anyway, it's not like we're completely out of options. We just found out that we need some sort of password to get in. All we need now is a plan to find out the password, and we will be right back on track." 
"Maybe we could obtain that information from the villagers, somehow," Leila writes. "I'm guessing that the farmers should know the password, since they would need to enter the city on a daily basis to shop for supplies."

"Leila makes a good point," Illuna says. "We could try to bribe one of the villagers. I'm guessing that it shouldn't be too hard to find someone willing to break the rules for some extra money in a village full of impoverished people."

"It's not as easy as you might think," Melindra says. "This city isn't like Thilias. Breaking the law here may well get your entire family murdered, or worse. Most people wouldn't take that risk, no matter how much money was at stake."

 "The password is 'shut your mouth and open the gate' "
"It looks like your companion has quite the refined sense of humor," the guard tells Daren, after throwing me a short glance. "I heard that those two big golems behind me have a pretty good sense of humor too. Maybe your friend would like me to introduce him to them? I'm sure they would get along."

"Please ignore my bodyguard," Daren says. "He sometimes doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut. I assure you that he does not speak for me in any way. Unfortunately, I do not know the password that you ask of me."

"If you don't know the password, then you will need to file for the required paperwork, like any other outsider," the guard says.

 "What if we tried to get one of them drunk, instead?"
"Hey, now that's an idea I can get behind!" Hadrik says. "I'm willing to bet that these people have never had the opportunity to try dwarven ale in their lifetimes, so we should easily find someone willing to drink with us, if I bring one of my bottles with me."

"Remember that we need to be careful," Daren says. "We can't just go around luring people to deserted alleys to drink with us, because it would look too suspicious. And if we just ask someone in public for the password, someone will surely overhear our conversation and report us to the guards."

"Don't worry about it," Hadrik says. "I know exactly how we can get someone to drink with us in private. But we can't go as a group, because we'd look too intimidating, especially with Daren walking alongside us. I'd say me and Barry should be enough to get the job done. What do you say, Barry? Are you ready to go hit up the local tavern?"

"Sure, I'm game," I say. "Lead the way."

"Perfect!" Hadrik says. "Let's get going. The rest of you should stay here, until we're done. We'll contact you through the transceivers as soon as we'll know the password."

"Don't forget to call us if anything unexpected happens!" Daren says. "We won't be able to tell if you're in trouble from all the way over here."

"Yeah, yeah, we'll call you if anything comes up," Hadrik says. "I'm sure we'll be fine, though."

 As Hadrik and I head out of the forest, we both look around, trying to figure out where the tavern is. Since there are no clear signs leading to it, Hadrik decides to ask one of the locals for directions.
"Hey, excuse me!" Hadrik asks a man who was sitting on a bench in his yard. "Would you mind telling us where your village's tavern is? Me and my friend could really go for a drink right about now!"

The villager stares at Hadrik with an absent-minded look on his face for a few seconds, and then he gets up from his bench and walks into his house, closing the door behind him without saying a word.

"I guess he wasn't really the talkative sort, eh?" Hadrik tells me.

He then turns around to address another man, who was busy digging up his front yard with a spade, in order to plant some seeds.

"Sir, excuse me!" Hadrik says. "Would you happen to know where the local tavern is?"

The man stops from his work to look at Hadrik, and he nods his head curtly in the direction of the tavern. He then goes back to his digging, without paying any more attention to us.

"Well... I guess now we know which way to go, then," Hadrik says, looking a bit confused by the reactions of the villagers towards us. "Let's get a drink."

 It doesn't take us long to find the tavern, after following the directions from that villager. Even though it wasn't written anywhere on the building that it was a tavern, we could see people walk out of it who were barely able to stand on their feet and who smelled strongly of alcohol, so there was no mistaking it.
We both enter the tavern and once we reach the counter, Hadrik immediately asks the bartender for the strongest alcoholic beverage they have on their menu. At first, the bartender didn't notice him, because the counter wasn't really built for dwarves so it was a little taller than Hadrik, but once he realized who was making the order, he poured him his drink in a wooden mug.

"That's your strongest drink?" Hadrik shouts, after drinking all of the alcohol in a single gulp. "I swear, you people outside the dwarven lands have no idea how to enjoy yourselves! Here, let me show you what real alcohol tastes like!"

He then takes a bottle of dwarven ale out of his backpack, and he stretches his arm up, so he can put it on the counter.

"See this?" Hadrik says, to the bartender. "This is dwarven ale! I guarantee you that you've never tasted anything better. Come on, have a taste! I've got plenty more of these in my backpack."

"I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to bring your own drinks to this tavern," the bartender says, in a cold tone. "If you want to drink your dwarven ale, then you can go outside."

"Oh, yeah?" Hadrik says, as he takes his bottle back. "Well, maybe I will, then."

 He then takes a drink from his bottle, and he turns towards the other people in the tavern.
"And anyone else who's tired of listening to this stuck up arsehole and his stupid rules can come join me too," Hadrik says. "Drinks are on me!"

We then both walk out of the tavern and stop right in front of it, as Hadrik takes another drink from his bottle.

"You think anybody will come?" I ask Hadrik.

"Trust me, I've done this in many places before, and it's never failed me so far," Hadrik says, as he takes a bottle of dwarven ale out of his backpack and hands it to me. "The countries might be different, but the taverns are always the same. We will most certainly be seeing at least one guy coming out to look for us in the next few seconds."

Just as soon as Hadrik stops talking, a middle-aged man that looks like a real heavy drinker walks out of the tavern, and he looks all around, to see if we've already left or not. Once the drunkard spots us, he immediately heads in our direction, and as he comes closer to us, the strong smell of alcohol from his breath is becoming increasingly harder to ignore.

"There we go!" Hadrik tells me, with a grin.

"So, uh..." the drunkard says, as he stops in front of us. "I heard you were willing to share that dwarven ale? Can I have a taste, or...?"

 "Tell you what..." Hadrik says, after he drinks from his bottle again. "For you, I'll make an exception and give you an entire bottle for free. What do you say?"
"An entire bottle of dwarven ale?" the drunkard says, unable to contain his excitement. "That's... mighty generous of you!"

"Yeah, well it's your reward for choosing us over that insufferable bartender of yours," Hadrik says, as he takes out another bottle of ale from his backpack and hands it to the middle-aged man. "Here you go. But let's not drink here. I'm not in the mood for that moron to come and complain that we're drinking on his front porch. Let's find some place more quiet, where we can properly enjoy this fine beverage without being disturbed by anyone."

"I know just the place!" the drunkard says, after he takes a drink from the dwarven ale bottle. "Follow me!"

"We're right behind you, buddy!" Hadrik says, as he grins at me, and then we both go to follow the drunkard to a more secluded location.

About five minutes of walking later, the drunkard stops in front of an empty house with broken windows. As we follow him inside, we realize that this building has likely been abandoned a long time ago, since it is filled with dust and spider webs, and it doesn't even have any furniture left.

Given that there are no beds or chairs we can sit on, the drunkard sits himself on the floor with his back leaning against one of the walls, while Hadrik and I follow his example and also sit on the floor in front of him, in a cross-legged position.

 "This house used to be inhabited by a family of mages," the drunkard tells us. "But it's empty now. Been this way for a while. I think it was one year ago... maybe two?... The mages just disappeared in the middle of the night and nobody has heard of them since. When we asked the guards what happened with the father and the three sons who used to live in this house, we were told to stop asking questions. So we stopped asking questions. Anyway, I figured that nobody would bother us here, since everyone's already stolen everything that could be stolen, and it's not like the house's owners are going to come back now, after all this time. Cheers!"
"Uh... cheers!" Hadrik says, as we all clink our bottles and then take a sip from them.

"This drink is... really strong!" the drunkard says. "I've only just started drinking, and I'm already feeling a bit drowsy."

"Heh!" Hadrik says. "I guess drinking dwarven ale right after another type of alcohol will have that effect on you, if you're not used to it. Don't worry about it. Even if you can't finish that bottle with us now, I'll still let you keep it."

"I never said I couldn't finish it!" the drunkard says, as he now takes a longer sip from his bottle. "Don't underestimate me, dwarf. I've been going to taverns since I was a wee lad. I won't lose to some 'dwarven ale', no matter how strong it is!"

"That's the spirit!" Hadrik says, as he takes a drink as well.

 "So..." I say, as I pretend to take a long drink from my bottle, even though I'm only taking small sips, in order to remain sober. "What do you suppose happened with the old owners of this house? Do you think they got arrested or something? How often do people in this village disappear out of the blue, anyway?"
"In the village, it doesn't happen all that often, but I'm not so sure about the city," the drunkard says. "I've been hearing lots of stories about people in there disappearing out of the blue, especially in the most recent years, and nobody knows what's happening. These are dark times we're living in, I'll tell you that. I don't know what you came here to accomplish, but I recommend you finish your business quickly and get out while you can. There's nothing good waiting for you in this place."

"Sadly, we might not even make it past the city gates, judging by how things have been going so far," Hadrik says.

"How so?" the drunkard asks, as he takes another drink from his bottle.

"Well, there was this guy who invited us here so we could trade with him," Hadrik says, "but he forgot to tell us that we needed a password to enter the city, and now we can't contact him anymore for some reason. We're just stuck waiting in front of the city, after we spent all that time to get here. That guard at the entrance said he'd commence some sort of procedure so we could receive permission to enter the city, but I don't trust a word of what he says. I bet he didn't even tell anyone that we're here, and he's just waiting for us to go away. What a waste of time this whole trip turned out to be..."

 "You can't get into the city?..." the drunkard says. "That's a real shame. And after you spent so much time to get here too..."
He pauses for a little, as he stares in front of him with a thoughtful look on his face.

"Yes... It would be a real shame if you couldn't get into the city just because of some dumb password," the drunkard says. "I don't know why they made up such a stupid rule. It's not like we even have that many visitors. Why would we turn away the few people that come here, just for the sake of 'security'? I'll tell you why they're asking for a password. It's because the king's lost it, that's why! He sees enemies everywhere. Even in his own city."

The man pauses again, as he takes another long drink from his bottle, and then he gazes in front of him again, this time with a more determined look in his eyes.

"Tell you what," the drunkard says, as he now turns to us. "I'll give you that password. I'd feel bad for you if you had to go back to your homeland empty-handed at this point, and you did give me this bottle of ale for free, after all!"

"You sure about that?" Hadrik asks him. "Won't the guards be upset with you if they find out?"

 "To hell with the guards and with the king!" the drunkard says, as he drinks again, and his face becomes a lot more red than before. "It's not like anybody's going to die just because of some harmless password. Just... make sure you don't tell anyone that you got it from me! I don't want to go to jail over something as trivial as this!"
"Of course, of course..." Hadrik says. "We'll just say that we managed to contact our client, and he gave us the password through the transceiver."

"Alright, then!" the drunkard says. "In that case, the password for this week is 'gargoyle wings'. Oh, and last week's was 'broken oars', in case they ask. This should be enough to get you through the front gates."

"Wow, that's great!" Hadrik says. "Thanks a bunch! I can't wait to see the looks on our friends' faces when we'll tell them that we managed to find out the password!"

"You can go tell them right now, I won't mind!" the drunkard says. "You don't need to worry about this old drunkard. I can find my own way home, and I'm sure that your trading partner must be waiting anxiously for you inside the city already."

 "That's a good idea! Let's go, Hadrik!"
"Uh... okay," Hadrik says, as we both get up from the floor. "I suppose I could finish my drink on the road, then."

"Goodbye, friends!" the drunkard says. "I wish you all the best!"

As we leave the abandoned building, we wave goodbye to our drunk friend, and then we take the main road back towards where Daren and the others were waiting in the woods.

"You know... we could have at least waited for the guy to be done with his drink..." Hadrik tells me, as we walk.

"And risk giving ourselves away?" I tell him. "No, thanks. The more we talked to him, the more likely it would have been for him to start asking us uncomfortable questions."

"If you say so," Hadrik says. "Anyway, I'm calling Daren. We should get ready to head for the city gates."

Hadrik then pulls out his transceiver and he uses the dial on the right side of it, in order to switch it to Daren's frequency before he calls out to him.

"Hey, Daren, you listening?" Hadrik says.

 "Yeah," Daren says. "Where are you?"
"We're on the main road," Hadrik says. "You should be able to see us if you come out of the forest. We got what we were looking for. Let's head for the gates."

"You did?" Daren asks, surprised. "That's great! Hold on, we'll be right there!"

As Daren and the others are coming out of the woods one by one, I put the lid on my dwarven ale bottle and hand it back to Hadrik, telling him that I'm done drinking for now.

"You shrewd bastard!" Hadrik says with a grin, as he feels the weight of the bottle in his hand. "You barely even took a few sips out of this bottle. No wonder you didn't seem to be affected by it. And here I was, thinking that you finally managed to build up a bit of tolerance to dwarven ale."

"Some other day, Hadrik," I say. "Some other day."

Once our friends reach us, we all begin heading for the city gates together, in the hopes that this time around we will be more successful. However, just as we are making our first steps, we hear an unfamiliar voice calling to us from inside the woods.

 "We can still wait for you to finish your drink. We're not in THAT much of a hurry."
"Yeah, I'm sure our friends won't mind if we keep them waiting for a few more minutes," Hadrik says. "Take your time and enjoy the drink."

"Well, in that case, bottoms up!" the drunkard says, and then we clink the bottles again.

Once we're finally done with the drinks and we decide to leave, we see that the drunkard can barely walk anymore, so Hadrik and I hurry to support him as we exit the building. Not long after we get out, the drunkard suddenly remembers something important and he struggles to articulate his words, while keeping his voice low.

"I... almost forgot..." the drunkard tells us. "The password isn't enough... You also need to... wink three times with your left eye while you say it. New set of rules.... in order to prevent eavesdropping."

"Oooh!" Hadrik says, also in a low voice. "Good thing you remembered, then! We might have had a bit of trouble if you didn't."

"Yeah, my bad..." the drunkard says. "They keep changing these rules every so often, and I just can't keep up with them anymore... My house is over there. You can leave me in front of the yard. I'll crawl my way to the front door by myself."

"Alright, then," Hadrik says, as the drunkard continues to lean on the two of us while he walks.

 As soon as we reach his house, we wave goodbye to our drunk friend, and then we take the main road back towards where Daren and the others were waiting in the woods.
"Hey, Daren, you listening?" Hadrik says, after he pulls out his transceiver and sets it to Daren's frequency.

"Yeah," Daren says. "Where are you?"

 "To be honest, I agree with Hadrik," I say. "We should just smash through their front gates. Like he said, at least this way we'd have the element of surprise. If we go back and tell the guard the password after we didn't know it the first time, we're just going to make ourselves look even more suspicious. I wouldn't put it past that guy to let us in only to lure us into a trap." 
"Yeah, exactly!" Hadrik says. "That's what I was thinking! See? Barry gets it!"

"Are you guys forgetting about those giant fire-breathing golems that are patrolling in front of the city walls?..." Daren says.

"Come on..." Hadrik says. "They're just metal golems. How tough can they be? No matter how durable their metal hide is, with my strength I could still send them flying with one punch, and those fire beams they were shooting out of their mouths were clearly made of magical fire, so Daren would be able to both defend us from them with his shield and absorb the flames with his sword. And while we'd be hiding inside Daren's magical barrier, the two of us could send their flames right back at them, while Kate, Flower and Illuna would shoot their own elemental magic towards them."

 "You do realize that those golems likely have anti-magic armor, don't you?" Daren says.
"If I had enough time to reinforce my icicles properly, I could probably penetrate their armor, even if it has anti-magic protection," Kate says. "Also, the impact from Flower's fireballs and Illuna's water jets can still do reasonable damage, even against anti-magic armor.  Besides, it's not like we need to hold them off for long. Once we make it into the city I'm sure the golems won't be able to follow us, because they'd be wreaking too much havoc and would put civilians' lives at risk."

"It's settled, then!" Hadrik says. "The first thing I'll do is destroy the gates, and then we'll advance slowly towards it, while hiding under the protection of Daren's magical barrier. Daren, you can still move while holding the barrier up, right?"

"Yeah, but we'd need to move really slowly..." Daren says. "Otherwise the protection spell would break, and I'd need to cast it again. But I still didn't say I agreed with any of this!"

 "Just so you guys know..." Melindra says. "I won't be using any of my powers to attack the golems. The risk of accidentally hitting you or one of the city guards with my spells is too great. I might cast the flying spell on Barry again, but no more than that."
"It's fine!" Hadrik says. "I will be the one focusing the most on the golems, anyway. After all, I won't be able to attack any of the locals, so it's the least I can do to make myself useful. The rest of you should concentrate on making it safely inside the city, while I have the golems' undivided attention."

"Great!" I say. "In that case, the ones of us who can attack the locals will deal with the city guards. If I'll have that flying spell from Melindra, I might even try to rid us of some of the guards stationed on the walls, so we won't need to worry about defending ourselves from too many directions."

"You people are just going to drag me into this plan of yours no matter what I say, aren't you?" Daren says, in a defeated tone of voice.

"Hah!" Arraka says. "Now you know what it feels like to have your opinions ignored over and over again. Remember when I suggested yesterday that we should have Flower send fireballs over their walls, so we could burn their houses down and smoke them out like the rats they are, but nobody paid any attention to me? If you would have backed me up then, you might have had my vote of confidence now, but it's too late for that. You already blew your chance!"

 "All jokes aside, we're kinda going to need a unanimous vote on this one," Hadrik says. "We're all putting our lives at stake here, so everyone who is not completely on board with this plan should mull it over for a bit, because once we've gone through those gates there's no going back. Maybe we should take a small break to clear our heads, and then we'll continue our discussion from where we left off. I'm sure we'll find a plan that everyone agrees on, eventually."
We all listened to Hadrik's advice and took a short break, in order to leave ourselves a bit of time to more calmly assess the situation. In the end, we managed to convince Daren to go through with our plan, even though he was still somewhat reluctant. We did, however, have to promise him that we'd do our best to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed and that we'd try to avoid killing the city guards as much as possible, since it wasn't their fault that they were being forced to follow their king's orders and they were only doing their jobs of defending their city from invaders.

Once we've all agreed on our course of action, we begin to walk out of the forest and to head back towards the main road. However, not long after we've reached the road that leads through the village, we hear an unfamiliar voice calling to us from inside the woods.

"I could try to eavesdrop on someone from afar," I say. "There's bound to be some villager who needs to get into the city eventually."

"That's actually a really good idea!" Daren says. "But how far would you need to be to hear the words properly? Can you hear the guard at the gates talking from all the way over here? Because we can't just have you wandering around aimlessly through the village until someone happens to want to enter the city. You would look too suspicious."

"It's alright," I say. "I won't need to enter the village, because I can hear what most of the villagers are talking from inside the forest. I usually ignore voices that are in the background because it's too difficult to focus on what each individual person is saying, but if I concentrate really hard I should be able to tell if someone is planning to head for the city gates, and then I'll be able to get a little closer."

"Well, don't strain yourself too much," Daren says. "We wouldn't want you to tire yourself out before we even begin infiltrating the city."

"Yeah, I know," I say. "I won't go overboard. Be right back. I'll try to get as close as I can to the edge of the woods, so I'll be able to hear as many of the villagers' conversations as possible."

 I then walk all the way to the end of the forest and I hide behind one of the trees, to make sure that nobody from the village can see me. I spend the next few minutes trying to concentrate on hearing what each individual person is saying, although given how many people seem to be talking at the same time, this is by no means an easy task. Most of the conversations are about mundane stuff, which is not useful to me in any way, though I can't help but notice that most of the people are talking in a very tired tone and that almost all of them seem to have a very pessimistic attitude, no matter the subject of discussion.
Sometimes, an isolated husband would vent his frustration towards the king or the city guards to his wife, but then he would stop suddenly, out of fear that someone might overhear him. Otherwise, the discussions of the villagers revolved mainly around their daily activities, and they wouldn't really talk about much else.

 After listening to hundreds of conversations for about ten minutes, I finally luck out and hear that one of the villagers is planning to head into the city, in order to go shopping for supplies. I immediately walk out of the woods and begin to follow the road towards the city gates at a slow pace, while trying to identify the man whose voice I heard earlier. It doesn't take me that long to figure out who it was, because not far from me, I can already see a guy pulling a small wooden cart behind him who is heading in the direction of the city. I pretend to look around for a signpost while I give the man with the cart enough time to distance himself from me, and then I begin to slowly walk in the direction of the city as well, to make sure that I don't let the man walk out of my hearing range.

 As soon as the man reaches the gates, the guard asks him for the password, and the villager responds to him with: 'gargoyle wings'. This was apparently the correct answer, since the gates in the distance are now opening and the golems are moving aside, to make way for the man to pass. Once the gates close back up, I pull out my transceiver and set it to Daren's frequency, so I can tell him what I found out.
"Hey, Daren, can you hear me?" I tell him, as I begin to head back in the direction of the forest.

"Yeah," Daren says. "What happened? Did your plan work?"

"It did," I say. "You can come out now. I'll be waiting for you on the main road, close to where we walked out of the woods the first time."

"Alright," Daren says. "We'll be right there."

Not long afterwards, I meet up with Daren and the others, and then we all begin heading for the city gates together. However, just as we are making our first steps, we hear an unfamiliar voice calling to us from inside the woods.

ID: B3-Ch02a-Information
TEXT: 

 "You there... humans!" the voice says in the Common language, but with a broken accent. "Don't go inside the city just yet. We have some important information that you might need. Information regarding the password required to go past the gates. If you're interested, then come back inside the forest, and we can talk."
As I try to figure out who is speaking to us, I realize that I can sense some very weak and heavily suppressed auras coming from behind the trees, although I would have had no chance to notice that they were there without knowing in advance where to look for them. Judging by their sizes and by the sound of that broken accent from earlier, my assumption is that we are dealing with a group of goblins.

"Arraka..." Illuna says. "Why didn't you notify us that we were being followed by goblins?"

"What kind of question is that?" Arraka says. "Do you also want me to tell you about the squirrels in the trees and the birds in the sky? You asked me to tell you about enemies that might try to surround you, and that's what I've been doing. These goblins are obviously harmless. They're barely armed, and you can see for yourself how weak their auras are. If I stopped to tell you about every single animal or monster in your vicinity, we'd never get anywhere."

 "But were they already in the area when we arrived, or did they follow us here?" Illuna asks.
"The goblins have been following us since earlier this morning," Melindra says. "I thought everybody knew about them by now. It didn't seem like they wanted to fight, so I just let them be."

"And how exactly do you know that they are not scouts of Tyrath?" Daren says, in a low voice, in order to make sure that the goblins cannot hear him. "They could have been leaking information about our location to the dragon for all this time!"

"So what?" Melindra says, now lowering her voice as well. "Tyrath's elite troops have already proven to you that they can find you no matter where you hide, scouts or no. How does letting a few goblins live make any significant difference?"

"Humans..." the goblin's voice calls to us again, from inside the forest. "Are you coming or not?"

 "Forget the goblins," I say. "There's no use in dealing with them at this point. If they were to leak information to Tyrath, they would have already done so by now, and it's not like they can follow us into the city. We're just wasting time talking about them. I say we stick with our initial plan and head for the gates."
"Yeah, I think that would be for the best," Hadrik says.

"Well, if everyone else also agrees, then let's get moving," Daren says. "Hopefully, Tyrath's troops won't be so brazen as to attack us while we're inside Ollendor."

Having said that, Daren begins to walk towards the city once more, as we all move to follow him. The goblin from earlier tries calling out to us one last time before we walk out of his hearing range, but we ignore him and go on our way.

It takes us a while, but once we're done traversing the village again, we eventually reach the gates for a second time. The guard at the gates is now staring at us with the same suspicious look that he had the first time, and he addresses us as soon as we stop in front of him.

"I see you're back," the guard says. "Should I take it that you've finally managed to get that 'client' of yours to give you the password?..."

 "I say we kill them, just to be safe," I tell the others, also in a low voice. "With a little luck, maybe they haven't told Tyrath anything yet, and we can delay the next monster ambush for a while longer."
"Yeah, that's what I was thinking," Daren says. "But we should be careful. For all we know, they could be luring us into a trap."

"Ugh..." Hadrik says. "Let's just get this over with, shall we? I'm not really a fan of killing weak, defenseless enemies."

"We'll be right over," I shout to the goblins. "Stay where you are."

Daren, Hadrik and I walk slowly towards the goblins until we get close enough to them, and then Daren and I pull out our weapons. We catch two of the goblins by surprise, killing them before they have the time to react, but the third goblin panics and starts running away from us. As Hadrik goes to chase him, an icicle flies between the trees and straight into the monster's head, causing him to drop dead on the spot.

"Hey, nice aim!" Hadrik tells Kate, as Melindra is now coming closer, to get a better look at the dead bodies of the goblins.

"I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but these goblins don't look like they could realistically have been part of Tyrath's army," Melindra says, after looking at the corpses for a few seconds. "Their equipment is far too basic, even for scouts."

"Then what reason could they have had to follow us for so long, if they weren't working for Tyrath?" Daren says.

 Melindra shrugs.
"I guess we'll never know," Melindra says. "Considering you killed them all before we could ask them, that is."

"Wait a minute..." I say. "Illuna, you don't suppose these goblins could have been part of Fyron's army, do you?"

"I highly doubt it," Illuna says. "They would have had no reason to wander off so far away from their main camp if they were Fyron's troops. Most likely, they were just some random goblins who were affiliated neither with the dragon nor with the goblin general."

"Well, no matter who they worked for, they were still monsters, so they were almost certainly up to no good," Daren says. "I don't think there's much use in dwelling on this any further. What's done is done. We should head for the city."

"Right..." Hadrik says in an unconvinced tone, as we all begin to head towards the city once more.

It takes us a while, but once we're done traversing the village again, we eventually reach the gates for a second time. The guard at the gates is now staring at us with the same suspicious look that he had the first time, and he addresses us as soon as we stop in front of him.

 "I think we should go talk to them and see what they want," I say, also in a low voice. "Just because they're goblins, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're part of Tyrath's army."
"And what if they are?" Daren says.

"Then we'll just have to deal with them accordingly, I guess," I say. "Still, I don't see any reason why some scouts would be calling out to us, instead of just keeping their distance, and I doubt they'd want to fight us since they're far too weak to have any hope of winning against our group. It's not like they would have had any time to set up traps either, since we only just came from that forest. I'm just saying it wouldn't hurt to go see what they want. They did say they knew something about the password, after all..."

"Fine..." Daren says. "I suppose we'll be seeing if they're hostile or not soon enough. But make sure you keep your guard up. We don't know what tricks they may have up their sleeves."

"Yeah, yeah..." I say, as we all begin heading back towards the forest.

"We're coming!" I tell the goblins. "Stay right where you are!"

As soon as we get back inside the forest, we see that the three goblins who called out to us are all wearing very cheap looking leather armor and that the weapons they are using seem to be in very poor condition. The older one of the three goblins is now stepping to the front, in order to introduce himself.

 "Greetings, travelers," the old goblin says in the Common language, as he takes a short bow. "I know that you're busy, so I'll try to keep this brief. We couldn't help but notice that you had some trouble entering the city earlier, and we thought that we could trade you some valuable information regarding the password you need, in exchange for one of the items in your possession."
"First things first," Daren says. "Do you work for Tyrath or not?"

"The king of all dragons?..." the old goblin says. "No, we've never been a part of his army."

"So you're with Fyron, then?" I ask him.

"No, we travel alone," the old goblin says. "The reason why we came here, to this city is because we know for a fact that they accept goblins inside their walls, along with other humanoid monster races, so we wanted to see if we could request shelter within their borders."

"Oh yeah?" Daren says. "If that's the case, then why have you been following us since this morning? Why not just head directly for Ollendor, while we were still camping?"

 The goblins exchange a few looks before the old goblin speaks again.
"We've been following you because we noticed your companion over there picking up some rocks on the bank of a river," the old goblin says, as he points towards Melindra. "The problem is that a friend of ours was supposed to write the password required to enter Ollendor on one of those rocks, but we think your friend may have picked it up by mistake. We would therefore like to share some information regarding the password with you, in exchange for that rock."

 "None of the rocks that I picked up had anything written on them, in either the Common language or the goblin language," Melindra says.

"Could you perhaps give us your rocks so we could have a look at them as well?" the old goblin says. "If we look at them more closely, it's possible that we'll find something you missed."

"Try to touch any of my rocks, and I will use a wind blade to cut you right in half," Melindra says, with a polite smile.

"I see..." the old goblin says, trying to remain calm. "Well, perhaps you could hold them yourself, and just show them to us one by one, then?"

"No, I'm not going to do that," Melindra says, still smiling.

"That is unfortunate," the old goblin says. "In that case, I'm afraid that a trade is no longer possible. We're sorry for wasting your time. We will, of course, be waiting here for you, in case you change your minds."

"That's it?" Daren asks. "You're not going to try and steal the rock from us?"

"Dear gods, of course not!" the old goblin says. "We're not savages!"

 "Huh..." Daren says. "Well, if you no longer have anything to discuss with us, I guess we'll be on our way, then."
"Farewell!" the old goblin says, and then we all head back towards the main road.

"Boy, what a complete waste of time that turned out to be, aye?" Hadrik says, as we walk out of the goblins' hearing range. "Let's hope that at least our plan to enter the city will be a bit more successful."

"Hold on a minute there, Melindra," I say. "I know for certain that I saw some words written in the goblin language on one of your rocks. It was on one of the rocks that you were showing to Flower, shortly before we reached the city."

"Oh?" Melindra says, with a puzzled expression on her face. "Which one?"

 "Umm, I think the rock was somewhat purple colored, and you could easily fit it in your palm," I say. "The engravings were pretty small, but you could see them if you looked carefully."
"Hmm..." Melindra says, as she takes off her backpack and then pulls a small purple rock out of it. "This one?"

She then stretches her arm towards me, so I can take a better look at the rock she is holding in her hand.

"Yes, that's the one!" I say. "Do you see those odd-looking scratches over there? Those are symbols from an older dialect of the goblin language."

"Ooh, it was an older dialect!" Melindra says, as she takes a good look at the rock in her hand. "That would explain why I didn't recognize this as a form of writing. My apologies, then. Here, you can have the rock, if it was originally yours."

She then hands the rock over to the old goblin, and he begins to study it closely.

"Oh, I understand..." the old goblin says. "It would appear that the password for this week is 'gargoyle wings'. Thank you. That's all we needed to know."

"Pardon?..." the old goblin says, as he is suddenly reminded of the rock that he was still holding in his hand. "Oh, you can take back the rock. All we needed from it was the password."

"That's very generous of you!" Melindra says, as the goblin hands her back the rock. "Many thanks!"

"Well, now that our business is done, I believe it's time we head towards the city," the old goblin says. "It might not be the best idea for us to go all at once, though, as we may seem suspicious. You can go first, if you want, and then we'll be following you soon afterwards."

 "What do you mean 'gargoyle wings'?..." I ask him, confused. "Doesn't that writing say 'griffin beak'?"
"Ah... I see you can read our old dialect!" the old goblin says, surprised. "Quite impressive! As for your question, the symbols describing the password can indeed be directly translated as 'griffin beak', but we have a code with our friend that we always use when we transmit messages to each other. If we rearrange those symbols according to our secret code, the meaning of the words changes completely, and it reads as 'gargoyle wings' instead. Do you understand now?"

"Yeah, I guess that makes sense," I say. "So, was this the information that you wanted to give us in exchange for the rock?"

"No, actually the information in question was about the fact that the password is not the only thing required, if you want to enter the city," the old goblin says. "You also need to wink three times with your left eye while saying it, or they won't let you in. This was added a while ago as an extra precaution, in order to prevent eavesdropping. The passwords change every week, but the number of winks do not change, as far as I'm aware."

 "Well, I guess we didn't really find out anything new, but at least we got some confirmation that our information was already correct," I say.
"Umm... excuse me!" Melindra says to the goblins, this time adopting one of her more pleasant smiles. "Would you perhaps be interested in a trade for that purple rock with the scribbles on it? I really took a liking to it, and would hate to lose it from my collection."

"Very well," the old goblin says. "In that case, we will be off. Take care!"

"Good thinking, Barry!" Hadrik says, once the goblins are too far away to hear us anymore. "If they're the ones to go first, we won't have to look like idiots in case the password is wrong."

"Well, there's that," I say, "but more importantly, there's also the fact that they can probably afford to get the password wrong once, since this is only their first time trying to pass through the gates. On the other hand, if we were to get the password wrong a second time, we would likely not be let inside their city ever again."

"We will find out if the password is fake or not soon enough," Daren says. "The goblins don't have long to go until they reach the gates."

We wait for a while longer until we see the goblins reach the entrance of the city, far in the distance. After a short discussion with the guard at the entrance, the gates are opening, and the three goblins get inside the city without any trouble.

 "Huh..." Hadrik says. "I guess the password worked, then? Come on, we should get going too. We've spent enough time in this forest, already."
It takes us a while, but once we're done traversing the village again, we eventually reach the gates for a second time. The guard at the gates is now staring at us with the same suspicious look that he had the first time, and he addresses us as soon as we stop in front of him.

"I see you're back," the guard says. "Should I take it that you've finally managed to get that 'client' of yours to give you the password?..."

"Yeah, we reached him through the transceiver eventually, and he told us the password," I say, as I wink three times with my left eye. "It's 'gargoyle wings'. "

"Hmm..." the guard says. "That is indeed the correct password."

He then gives a signal to the two metal golems behind him, who immediately open the large gates for us.

"I'm not sure what you came here to do exactly, but you'd better not cause any trouble," the guard tells us.

"No, sir!" I say. "We won't be bothering you at all!"

 "What now, then?" Kate asks us, after we get a little further into the city. "Are we going to do a bit of reconnaissance, or should we head directly for the palace?"
"I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunities to study their defenses on our way to the castle," Daren says. "Given that we don't really know when the ambassador will be back, I don't think we should be wasting any time exploring the city. Melindra, do you know in which general direction the palace should be?"

"Yes," Melindra says. "If the layout of the city is still the same as it was before they banished me, the shortest route would be to go through the Perrelion plaza. Follow me."

Melindra takes the lead and we all go to follow her, while both the citizens on the ground and those flying in the metal vehicles above calmly go about their daily lives, not paying much attention to us.

"Leila, do you have any means of communicating with your father?" Daren says. "Can you let him know we're here?"

 "No..." Leila writes. "He did not have any items with him when we were escaping Thilias together, so I can't call him on a transceiver.  Before we got separated, he promised me that when I would reach Ollendor, he would find a way to contact me no matter what, but I don't know how long it will take him to become aware of my arrival."
"Don't worry," Daren says. "With all the ruckus that we will be causing inside the city soon, I'm sure that he'll find his way to us eventually."

"Let's hope you are right!" Leila writes.

As we advance through the city, I notice that most of the houses have a very strange style of architecture, unlike most regular buildings that you would expect to see in a typical city. Some of the houses have more than four floors and are built in an oval shape. Some of them are built entirely out of glass. Others are made from metal, coated with seredium dust. It's pretty hard to find two houses that look exactly the same, and several of the buildings honestly look like whoever designed them was just messing around.

"Uh, yes..." I say. "Yes, of course!"

"Alright, then," the guard says. "You're all under arrest. We're going to keep you in a cell until this mystery client of yours shows up to confirm that he invited you here. If he doesn't show up in a few weeks, then you're going to get executed for attempting to illegally infiltrate the city."

As soon as the guard turns around to lead us into the city, Hadrik looks at Daren, who gives him a curt nod.

"Hey, wait a second!" Daren says, as he puts his hand on the guard's shoulder. "I think there's still something that you might not have considered."

 "Oh, yeah?" the guard says, as he turns to face Daren. "Like what?"
Just as the guard is turning, Hadrik runs right past him and he heads towards one of the two big golems that were stationed about a dozen feet in front of the gates.

As soon as he gets close enough, Hadrik jumps high up into the air and with one strong punch to the face, he knocks one of the golems off its feet and sends it flying into the large gates behind it. The doors could not withstand the impact of the crash and they got blown out of their hinges, but now the large golem that fell on top of them is struggling to get back up. Hadrik gives the golem no time to recover and he quickly jumps on its big head, battering it with a quick flurry of punches, until the giant metal construct stops moving completely.

"Have you gone completely insane?!" the guard shouts at us, but before he gets to say anything else, Daren bashes him in the head with his shield, knocking him unconscious.

"Everyone, get inside my barrier, now!" Daren says.

He then raises his shield, and a semi-transparent magical barrier appears all around us. Several of the golems that were further away from us have already noticed that something is wrong, and they are all preparing to shoot beams of fire out of their mouths towards us, in unison.

 Four beams of fire hit Daren's barrier at once, generating an explosion of hot air that can be somewhat felt even by the ones of us who are inside. It doesn't look like the golems can move while they're firing their beams at us, so at least they won't be able to get any closer to us unless they cancel their attacks. Meanwhile, Hadrik has begun to assault the second golem by the gates, but he is having a little more trouble with it than with the first one. The golem seems strong enough to push Hadrik back, and since he can't risk getting hit by any of the beams, the dwarf is being forced to fight in a somewhat more evasive style than usually.
"Kate, could you take one or two of the golems out?" Daren says, as the air inside the barrier is slowly getting hotter. "I can't move the barrier while it's being assaulted by so many beams at once."

"Unfortunately, I'm already too busy with defending us from the rain of arrows coming from above," Kate says.

As we look upwards, we see that Kate is controlling several flying platforms of ice that are constantly moving to intercept the crossbow bolts and arrows coming from the guards stationed on top of the walls.

 "Unless you've suddenly learned to make barriers against non-magic attacks, dismissing those ice platforms will mean our deaths," Kate says. "Somebody else will need to focus on attacking the golems."
"Damn it, you're right!" Daren says.

He then sticks his sword out of the barrier in order to start absorbing one of the fire beams, and once the sword becomes flaming hot, he swings it with full force back towards the golem that shot it. The beam from Daren's sword and the one coming from the golem collide with each other, and they create an explosion of air powerful enough that it knocks the golem off its feet and it also makes a small crack in Daren's semi-transparent barrier.

"Flower and I will go deal with the guards on the walls," Illuna says, while the golem that fell earlier is in the process of getting back up.

"Make sure not to kill them!" Daren says. "Remember, it's not their fault. They're only defending their city!"

"Right..." Illuna says, as she steps out of the barrier, jumps into the air, and then Flower turns on her fire jets.

"You have the flying spell, Barry," Melindra says, as I suddenly feel her air currents rotating around my body. "Do with it as you see fit."

"I'll go help Illuna," I say. "The sooner we deal with the crossbowmen, the better."

I take the crossbow out of my backpack, I raise my arms in the air in order to tell the air currents that I want to go up, and then I begin heading above the walls, so I can get a good view of my enemies. One of the golems notices me flying out of Daren's barrier and he quickly switches his targets, now shooting his fire beam straight at me. I dodge the beam, but several of the crossbowmen on the walls have now also noticed me and they are currently shooting dozens of bolts in my direction.

As I struggle to evade the beam and the arrows in mid-air by flying as unpredictably as possible, Illuna fires a torrent of water out of her hands, flooding some of the crossbowmen that were shooting at me and her.

However, what I didn't realize was that a second golem from behind me was also readying his fire beam at the time, and I never even got to see the attack coming, before I was turned into ashes.

"I'll go help Illuna," I say. "The sooner we deal with the crossbowmen, the better."

I take the crossbow out of my backpack, I raise my arms in the air in order to tell the air currents that I want to go up, and then I begin heading above the walls, so I can get a good view of my enemies. One of the golems notices me flying out of Daren's barrier and he quickly switches his targets, now shooting his fire beam straight at me. I dodge the beam, but several of the crossbowmen on the walls have now also noticed me and they are currently shooting dozens of bolts in my direction.

As I struggle to evade the beam and the arrows in mid-air by flying as unpredictably as possible, Illuna fires a torrent of water out of her hands, flooding some of the crossbowmen that were shooting at me and her.

However, what I didn't realize was that a second golem from behind me was also readying his fire beam at the time, and I never even got to see the attack coming, before I was turned into ashes.

}
#if(v_perception == 4 && v_b3_ch1_unlock != 2) {
 Seeing that the golems aren't planning on leaving me alone, I decide to place myself between them and the crossbowmen, and I wait to see what happens. My plan seems to be working, as the golems have immediately stopped using their beam attacks, in order to avoid hurting their own troops by accident, and they are now simply looking at me without doing anything. I make sure to maintain the exact same level of height and I begin flying horizontally, shooting the crossbowmen in their legs one at a time, while also dodging the crossbow bolts that they're shooting at me. When they realize that I'm not planning to move away from their allies, the two golems that were shooting at me decide to switch their targets, and to go after Hadrik, who is already done with the golem at the gate and is now rushing towards one of the others.
In the meantime Daren, who now has less fire attacks focusing him, can finally move with his barrier a little, so he is heading slowly for the gates, along with Kate, Leila and Melindra. As Illuna and I deal with a few more of the crossbowmen and archers, Kate decides that she can now dismiss some of her defensive ice platforms, and she is focusing on reinforcing a large icicle in the sky, making sure that the projectile is strong enough to go through the golems' anti-magical armor.

However, it seems that the golem in front of me and the crossbowmen are not my only problems. With the tail of my eye, I somehow manage to see another golem readying his fire beam from behind me, which gives me just enough time to fly out of its way and to avoid death by a mere few inches.

 After we incapacitate a few more of the crossbowmen, Kate shoots her giant icicle with an incredible force, causing an explosion of air behind it and going straight through one of the golems' heads, immediately sending it falling to the ground with a loud thud. At the same time, Hadrik also finishes off another one of the golems and he is moving on to his fourth.
Unfortunately, while we were busy dealing with the few golems that were near enough to engage us immediately, about a dozen more large golems that heard the commotion have been slowly getting closer to us, and they will soon be within firing range of their beam attacks. As Hadrik grabs the attention of one of the two golems that are close enough to attack us, and the last golem who was attacking Daren's barrier begins to target Illuna and Flower instead, Daren and the others quickly rush out of the barrier towards the gates, and they call out to us as soon as they reach them.

"Over here!" Daren shouts to us. "Leave the golems and come here! Quick, before the other ones reach us!"

Once I get close enough to the golems, I shoot a few crossbow bolts at them, in order to grab their attention. As I suspected, the bolts do no damage to them whatsoever, but at least it looks like I've succeeded in my primary purpose of providing a good distraction. All three of the golems close to me have already stopped targeting Daren's barrier and they are turning their heads towards me, preparing to charge up their fire beams. As soon as they start shooting at me, I begin flying around erratically, trying to make it as difficult as possible for them to predict my moves.

Dodging three beams of fire constantly proved to be a little more than I could handle, however, and it only took one minor slip-up on my part to make me miss my timing and get incinerated in an instant.

 As the three beams of fire keep following me through the sky, I am often required to make full use of my superhuman reflexes to dodge the enemies' attacks effectively. Luckily for me, I don't need to keep this up for too long, because Hadrik soon manages to finish off the golem at the gates, and then he comes over to my side to engage one of my opponents in combat, forcing it to cancel its beam attack and to fight more defensively.

"I'll try to deal with one of the golems," I say. "The quicker we take them out, the better."

"Wait, you're planning to attack one of them on your own?..." Daren says. "I really hope you're not being serious right n--"

I don't let Daren finish his sentence, and I raise my arms in the air, in order to tell the air currents that I want to go up into the sky. I then fly out of the barrier, trying to go as high up as possible, so that I don't make myself into a target for either the golems or the guards on the wall. I take a good long look at the battlefield, and I decide that my best bet is to attack the golem that is currently the most isolated out of the four who are attacking Daren's barrier.

I dive down from the sky as fast as I can, putting both my fists in front of me, in order to tell my currents to keep accelerating. Then, when I arrive close enough to the golem I was targeting, I put all of my strength behind my punch, and I hit my enemy directly in the face, before it gets the chance to react.

Sadly for me, hitting the hard metal surface of the golem with my frail arm had about as much effect on it as if I were to hit it with a small twig. Trying to ignore the pain from my fist, I immediately fly backwards in an attempt to retreat, but the golem quickly turns its beam of fire upon me, and I am much too close to it to be able to avoid it in any way. It only takes a second for the beam to completely incinerate me and to turn me into ashes.

 My strike was powerful enough to send the golem falling on its back, but only barely, and I still had to reign in the pain from hitting the hard metal surface with my bare fist. I waste no time and I pull out my dagger, jumping on the golem's face and stabbing one of its eyes with my weapon as hard as I can. The metal construct makes some very strange noises and it fails to lift itself back up, which makes me think that my attacks are working, so I pull my dagger out of the eye socket and stab my enemy in the other eye as well.  Seeing that the golem is still not dead, I twist my blade a little harder inside, until my opponent stops moving completely.
As I turn around to see what the others are doing, I notice that Hadrik has already dealt with the golem at the gates and that he is now heading towards one of the others. Since there are only two golems left in our area aside from the one Hadrik is engaging, I decide to take out my crossbow and to go distract them, in order to give Daren, Kate, Leila and Melindra enough time to reach the gates safely.

 Once I get close enough to the two golems, I shoot them both with my crossbow, which causes them to immediately stop attacking Daren's barrier and to focus on me instead. Seeing that they are no longer being targeted by any of the fire beams, Daren and the others quickly take advantage of this opportunity to make a rush for the city gates, while Hadrik manages to finish off yet another golem, now moving on to his fourth.
Unfortunately, it seems that while we were busy dealing with the few golems that were near enough to engage us immediately, about a dozen more large golems that heard the commotion have been slowly getting closer to us, and they will soon be within firing range of their beam attacks.

"Over here!" Daren shouts to us, as soon as he and the others reach the gates. "Leave the golems and come here! Quick, before the other ones reach us!"

 Illuna, Hadrik and I do exactly as Daren says, and we head towards the gates as quickly as we can. Almost immediately after we go past the large broken doors, the two remaining golems close to us shoot their beams at the same time, while Daren readies his shield and makes another barrier. The two beams of fire meet each other and create another big explosion, sending some rubble flying our way, which is quickly taken care of by Hadrik with a few punches.
As we head further into the city, the golems seem to have abandoned pursuit, likely so that they don't risk causing too much collateral damage to the townspeople with their devastating attacks.

"What now, then?" Kate asks us, as we move past several groups of frightened citizens, who apparently came near the gates to see what the commotion was about. "Do we look for a place to hide, or do we keep going forward?"

"Considering that we've already gotten this far, it's probably a better idea to head directly for the palace," Daren says. "The longer we wait, the more time we give them to organize themselves. Melindra, do you know in which general direction the palace should be?"

"Yes," Melindra says. "If the layout of the city is still the same as it was before they banished me, the shortest route would be to go through the Perrelion plaza. Follow me."

 Melindra takes the lead and we all go after her, while more and more curious citizens are getting out of their houses and heading towards the city's entrance, to see what happened. In contrast, the people that are flying in the metal vehicles above the city seem to be minding their own business, and they're not paying any attention to what happens below them.
"Leila, do you have any means of communicating with your father?" Daren says. "Can you let him know we're here?"

"No..." Leila writes. "He did not have any items with him when we were escaping Thilias together, so I can't call him on a transceiver. Before we got separated, he promised me that when I would reach Ollendor, he would find a way to contact me no matter what, but I don't know how long it will take him to become aware of my arrival."

"Don't worry," Daren says. "With all the ruckus that we will be causing inside the city soon, I'm sure that he'll find his way to us eventually."

"Let's hope you are right!" Leila writes.

As we advance through the city, I notice that most of the houses have a very strange style of architecture, unlike most regular buildings that you would expect to see in a typical city. Some of the houses have more than four floors and are built in an oval shape. Some of them are built entirely out of glass. Others are made from metal, coated with seredium dust. It's pretty hard to find two houses that look exactly the same, and several of the buildings honestly look like whoever designed them was just messing around.
