I hope I didn't end up disappointing any of you by saying this.\"<br/><br/>\"Umm, no... of course not!\" Daren says. \"It's your choice whether you want to be king or not. I was only making a suggestion, that's all...\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

That is most certainly a... unique recommendation. Not to say that we won't take it under consideration, of course, but... uh... would anyone else perhaps like to make any other suggestions?\"<br/><br/>\"I would actually like to give my vote to Kelrim as well,\" Daren says. \"I have every reason to believe that he would make for an excellent king.\"<br/><br/>\"D-did I just hear that right?\" Kelrim says, as he is now quickly approaching us. \"Daren, did you just propose me as a candidate for the throne?...\"<br/><br/>\"Well, to be more accurate, Barry was the one who proposed you first, but yes, I also agree with him,\" Daren says.<br/><br/> \"I... thank you both for the trust you've put in me,\" Kelrim says, as he looks at the two of us in turn, \"but you have to understand... a goblin as a king for a city that is comprised of mostly humans would be something completely unprecedented. I am already immensely grateful to the citizens of Ollendor for being accepting enough of the monster races to let us live inside their city, but to even think of becoming their ruler feels like I would be taking too much advantage of their generosity. And besides, I can't think of anyone other than the two of you who would even consider giving me their support in this matter. I'm really sorry, but--\"<br/>\"I would give you my support!\" we hear a man speaking loudly, as he is now exiting the quarantine area and closing the door behind him.<br/><br/>The man is wearing tattered clothes, and he looks like he is barely standing up, but his imposing physique and the unrelenting expression in his eyes give him a sort of dignified look even in the state that he is in. <br/><br/>\"Brother, what are you doing out here?\" Desmond says all of a sudden, looking very worried. \"You're still recovering. You should be in bed!\"<br/><br/>\"Nonsense!\" the man who came out of the quarantine area says, as he is now slowly limping towards us. \"As you can well see, I am fit as a fiddle!\"<br/><br/>\"That's Desmond's brother?\" I ask Daren in a low voice. \"How is he already able to walk? I thought he was on the verge of death only yesterday.\"<br/><br/> \"I have no idea,\" Daren answers me. \"I've seen many speedy recoveries in my time, but never to such a degree. He would need immense willpower to even stand up in the state he is in right now.\"<br/>\"How did you hear our conversation from inside the quarantine area?\" Albert asks Desmond's brother when he gets closer to us. \"Have you been eavesdropping on us through the door this whole time?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, not the WHOLE time,\" Desmond's brother says as he now stops somewhere near Kelrim, while leaning with one arm on Daren's shoulder, for balance. \"I initially wanted to surprise my little brother by showing him how sprightly I was, but your discussion was so interesting that I couldn't help but stop to listen to it. I wasn't really planning to intervene until these fine folks over here nominated our good friend Kelrim as the new king, at which point I immediately knew that I had to show up and announce my support for him!\"<br/><br/>\"Is that Sir Horace?\" I hear one person from the crowd of people in the waiting room. \"By the gods, it's really him! He is alive. Sir Horace is alive!\"<br/><br/>\"You're right!\" says another man. \"He is alive and well! Thank the gods!\"<br/><br/>\"Sir Horace has returned to us!\" says a third person, in an excited tone. \"He has returned!\"<br/><br/>",

This may be difficult for an outsider to understand, but many of the citizens of Ollendor are highly dependent on the use of their devices. For example, there are a lot of people in this city who would normally need to walk for hours to get from their homes to their workplaces, but with the use of the flying metal vehicles that you probably have already seen roaming the skies before the lockdown, they can get there in half an hour or less. If these metal vehicles were to suddenly stop functioning, many people would be out of a job, and they would eventually run out of money to buy food for their families. Would you like to take responsibility for ruining all these people's livelihoods just to make yourself feel better for saving a few extra prisoners?\"<br/><br/> \"Those 'few extra prisoners' have been living in hell for who knows how many months,\" Kate says, angrily. \"Don't you dare compare their situation to some lazy good-for-nothings that couldn't even be bothered to walk a few more hours to work so that they could feed their own families!\"<br/>\"I can clearly see that this situation is affecting you on a personal level,\" the king of the underground says, after seeing the fury in Kate's eyes. \"And I will admit that I may have overly-simplified the precarious situation in which these prisoners are currently finding themselves... However, I also think that your personal bias is causing you to make some unfair comparisons of your own. Maybe the example I used wasn't the most inspired one, but surely you could see how the sudden malfunction of the primary means of transportation in a city could cause its infrastructure to collapse in on itself, wouldn't you? There are even people who make a living by transporting goods from one end of the city to the other by using their metal vehicles, for gods' sakes... Could you even imagine how the people of Ollendor would react if every device in the city would stop working and thousands of people would suddenly be out of their jobs as soon as a new king were to take the throne? There would be riots of such magnitude that it could start a whole civil war!\"<br/><br/> \"So that's the real reason why you don't want to save those prisoners,\" Kate says, in a disgusted tone. \"It's because it would ruin your chances of holding on to your precious throne.\"<br/>After hearing what Kate had to say, the king of the underground closes his eyes and shakes his head in disapproval for a second or two.<br/><br/>\"It's clear that we're not making any progress with this conversation,\" the king of the underground says. \"Believe what you want. Either way, I think you've already gotten the answer you were looking for. Now perhaps it is finally time for us to have a little discussion about the Overseer, and the hold that he currently has over this city?\"<br/><br/>\"Maybe we should, yes,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>",

My days of being a royal guard are far behind me. For many years, I've been nothing more than a rebel and a citizen of the underground, like the rest of you. We are all equal here! Well... I suppose that some of us are more equal than others.\"<br/>As he was saying those last words, Sir Horace was looking straight at the king of the underground, waiting to see if he would respond to his provocation.<br/><br/>\"I see that you are still as popular as ever, Horace,\" the king of the underground says. \"I will admit that I didn't expect to see you on the other side of that door so soon. Your vitality never ceases to amaze me even after all these years I've known you.\"<br/><br/>\"Come on, 'king', you and I both know that my health is not the real subject you want to discuss with me right now,\" Desmond's brother says, with half a grin. \"I think the first thing you'd want to ask me is why I decided to come out of the quarantine area now of all times, especially after you only just paid me a visit to ask me nicely if I could stay inside there for a while longer so that you could run your little election without interference.\"<br/><br/>\"The thought has crossed my mind, yes,\" the king of the underground says.<br/><br/> \"Well, I'm going to be honest with you,\" Horace says. \"At first I wasn't planning to interfere, just like I haven't interfered with any of the other decisions that you've taken in the many years since we've been working together. We all know that you've done your fair share of shady stuff in the past, but most of it has been in the interest of our people, so I wouldn't really have minded too much even if you were going to run a sham of an election and declare yourself as king of the whole city. However... when I heard Kelrim talking earlier about how nobody would be on his side if he were to run for king... I don't know how to tell you this, but I was simply overcome with an emotion strong enough that it got the better of me, and so here I am!\"<br/>\"Once again, you are letting your feelings cloud your judgment,\" the king of the underground says. \"Have you stopped to consider what it would mean to propose a goblin as the new king to the people of Ollendor right after they find out that the old king was murdered? They're going to think that we sold them to the monsters! It won't matter if he has good intentions or not. They're going to want his head on a pike the minute after we announce our support for him.\"<br/><br/>\"Horace, I really appreciate the fact that you are taking my side, but I can't do this,\" Kelrim says. \"I am only a healer. I am neither a diplomat nor a skilled warrior. I have no leadership skills. I wouldn't even know where to begin.\"<br/><br/> \"Then I will help you,\" Horace says. \"I will be your right hand man. It's the least I can do to repay you after all the help you've given me in these last few weeks. You don't need to worry about whether you can do the job properly or not. All you need to worry about is whether you WANT to be king or not. This is what you need to decide. Do you want to be king or not?\"<br/>\"Do I want... to be king?\" Kelrim asks, looking as if he were finally starting to consider the possibility in earnest.<br/><br/>",

At most, they will elect him as the new king, thinking that you will be the real ruler behind the scenes. But if that is really how it's going to be, then what is the purpose of all these charades? Why not just challenge me directly? I'd much rather have you running against me in the election and winning than having you use some goblin healer as a proxy!

Nobody said he's actually--\"<br/><br/>\"Kelrim is running for king?\" says another man, who is quickly approaching us. \"I'll vote for him with both hands! My wife would have been long dead if not for him. He is a hero!\"<br/><br/>\"Did you hear that?\" I hear two men talking about a dozen feet away from us. \"Kelrim is planning to participate in the election. And Sir Horace said he'd be his right hand man!\"<br/><br/> \"Kelrim as king?\" the second guy says. \"That's the best idea I've heard all day!\"<br/>Once a few more people start to talk about it loudly, the news seems to be spreading like wildfire. Several people are already crowding up around us, for a chance to squeeze Kelrim's hand. Some of them are former victims of the plague, others are family members of the victims, while others are simply people that were helped by him since he came to the underground tunnels. As the whole area around us is getting filled with men and women of all ages, coming to express their support for the goblin healer, more and more people are getting curious to find out what the commotion is about.<br/><br/>\"Kelrim?...\" I hear a man in the distance, who appears to be one of the refugees. \"Is that the little guy who's been running around healing everyone until he almost fainted from exhaustion after the royal guards blew up the ceiling? He's running for king? I guess I know who has my vote, then!\"<br/><br/>\"What about the other guy?\" another refugee says. \"What was his name again? King of the underground or something? Isn't he still in the running too?\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, but that guy's shady as hell,\" the first guy answers. \"Who in their right mind would even vote for him after having Kelrim as an alternative?\"<br/>After hearing these last words, I check to see what the king of the underground's reaction is, out of curiosity. To my surprise, the man is like an impregnable fortress. You can clearly tell that he is consumed by rage if you've studied his facial expressions for long enough to tell the difference, but to someone who doesn't know him well, he would probably look as if he were completely unaffected by what's happening around him.<br/><br/>I guess I have to give credit where credit is due. I don't think I've ever seen someone with greater self-restraint than this.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " As promised, I spent my next few hours mostly just walking around from place to place, trying to see if I could gather any useful information. I visited most of the major areas such as the mess hall, the living quarters, the infirmary and the recreation area, but sadly I couldn't really achieve much more than to confirm some of my suspicions. <br/>In pretty much every location that I went to, I would always run across some of the men that were strategically placed by Albert to sing the king of the underground's praises, but from what I could tell, there were a lot of people who weren't really buying it. There seemed to be plenty of men who were not exactly happy with the king of the underground's methods and who would happily vote for any other alternative that presented itself to them, and it also appeared that the king of the underground had a not-so-good reputation among the refugees coming from the surface.<br/><br/>From what I could gather, many of these refugees knew him as a mob boss of some sort, which isn't all that surprising, considering the dubious-sounding title that he chose for himself and his fondness for assassinating people that he doesn't like. There were also some refugees who seemed to have wrongly remembered his name as being king of the 'underworld' instead of 'underground', which makes him sound even more suspicious than he already is.<br/><br/> While I went around from one place to the other, I also took the opportunity to check up on my friends to see what they were doing whenever I was in the area. Kate and Arraka were in the middle of an argument when I found them. Seemingly, they were having a discussion about the origins of the various races in the world, and Kate was of the opinion that the reason why there are the exact same races on both the magical plane and the earthen plane is because both of these planes of existence originated from the primordial plane.<br/>Arraka disagreed with this hypothesis, saying that there was no solid proof to support her theory, and that even if these races were to have originated from the primordial plane, it would still not explain why the Magium has a system in place for creating new spirits in the magical plane with the exact same races as before.<br/><br/>Apparently, Arraka's theory is that the splitting of the primordial plane was an accident of some sort, and that the Magium is currently trying to patch it up like some sinking ship by artificially regulating the number of spirits on the magical plane and by using time weavers' prophecies on the earthen plane to try and avoid cataclysmic events that would cause too many people to die simultaneously. <br/><br/> She also seems to believe that the races we currently have in the magical and earthen planes have nothing to do with the original races from the primordial plane, and that they are also likely a result of the accident that caused the split.<br/>I didn't stay with them long enough to hear the end of their discussion, but it looked to me like Arraka hadn't really been all that successful in her attempts of convincing Kate to change her stance on the subject.<br/><br/>After also paying short visits to Hadrik, Daren and Leila, who were all still busy with the tasks that they set out to accomplish when we first split up, time flew by, and eventually every one of us was contacted by Daren so that we could finally meet up somewhere in an abandoned tunnel with no crystals and decide what we would tell the Overseer.<br/><br/>There was a rather long discussion, with everyone giving their own different opinions, but after expending a lot of effort I was finally able to convince my friends that our best course of action would be to...<br/><br/>",

Leila, do you still want to do a night shift together? We could volunteer to take the second one tonight, if you want.\"<br/>\"Sounds like a plan!\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"It's settled, then,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Wow...\" Hadrik says. \"I never thought I'd see the day when two grown men would offer to cheer me up with drinks on the same night. I guess I must have been a real downer lately, huh? Well, that is about to change really soon! Daren, get ready! We're doing a drinking marathon tonight. Don't say I didn't warn you!\"<br/><br/>\"If doing a marathon means drinking slow sips every few minutes or so, then sure, I'm all for it,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Hahaha!\" Hadrik says. \"That's Daren for you! Always joking around!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not joking, though,\" Daren says. \"I'm not doing a drinking marathon before a big battle. You know it's not happening.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll warm up to the idea after the first few drinks,\" Hadrik says. \"Let's go. I have all the bottles we need here in my backpack!\"<br/><br/> As Daren and Hadrik walk out the door, the rest of us go to bed, and I manage to sleep for about five hours or so before Daren comes to wake me up, so that Leila and I can take the second night shift. Once we find the corridor that Daren and Hadrik used before us, we sit down on the floor with our backs against a wall, and as we begin to talk, a few hours pass us by without even realizing it.<br/>Just like the last time when Leila and I sat down like this to talk, I continue to be amazed at how effortlessly we can jump from topic to topic without ever seeming like we're going to run out of subjects to discuss. In only a few hours, we've already spoken about magical theories, about creatures and plants that are native only to Varathia, and even about obscure details regarding her father's techniques for making devices. However, despite the tedious nature of some of these subjects, for some reason I have not even once felt bored throughout this entire conversation. It really does feels like I could talk to her about anything.<br/><br/> \"You know, I've always wondered about something...\" I tell Leila, as she is sitting beside me, with her legs tucked up in front of her. \"How is it that you can be so talkative whenever you are alone with me or Kate, but when we are in a group you barely write a word? Are you just not all that comfortable around the others, or is it a problem that you have with groups in general?\" <br/>\"I... think it's more of a general problem,\" Leila writes, as she takes a few seconds to think about what I've said. \"I haven't really had the chance to interact with groups ever since I was at the Beacon, and back then I didn't have my stat device to write for me, so all I could do was sit silently in a corner without saying anything. Since it's been mostly just me and my father after we escaped from the Beacon, I just can't seem to get comfortable with anything other than one-on-one conversations, no matter how hard I try. \"<br/><br/>",

Maybe that way it would have been easier for you to join a discussion in a natural way without constantly having to feel like you are interrupting.\"<br/>\"Yes, exactly!\" Leila writes, as she suddenly turns towards me, looking a little too excited that somebody actually managed to place himself in her shoes and see things from her perspective. \"That is exactly how I feel whenever I try to join a conversation! It's like I'm always interrupting!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, it's not a surprise that you feel that way,\" I say. \"Even if your device is designed to translate your thoughts into words, I imagine that there is still a sizeable delay between the moment when you are having your thoughts and the moment when the device actually displays the text. Also, from what I've seen, you have control over the position of the text and its size too, so by the time you're done setting up all these variables, the brief point in time where you could insert yourself into the conversation without making things awkward is probably long gone.\"<br/><br/>\"Mhm,\" Leila writes, while looking at the wall in front of her as she slowly extends her legs. \"And even if I somehow manage to get the timing right, if I don't place the text in a spot that is visible for everyone, they might notice it too late and then I'd still be interrupting. Having a voice would make things so much easier...\"<br/><br/> \"Well,\" I say, \"I'm not sure how much this helps, but at the very least now you can rest assured that there is one person in the world who can imagine you with a voice.\"<br/>\"...What do you mean?\" Leila writes, confused.<br/><br/>\"The voice from the ethereal plane, remember?\" I tell Leila. \"The one that was translating your thoughts to me while we were both being sent around the room flying by the Magium.

I think the voice you heard was the latest version of it, which is the one I'm using to think right now, because I could hear my thoughts echoing around me in the ethereal plane, and they sounded just like it. To be honest, when I made this voice I didn't really expect anyone other than me to ever hear it, so talking about it like this is a little embarrassing...\"<br/><br/>",

Still, even after all these years, I can't say that my tolerance compares to that of most dwarves I've met in the taverns I frequent. It's like those little guys have livers made of elven steel. It's no wonder that they needed to invent a type of alcohol as strong as dwarven ale. Everything else would probably taste like water to them!\"<br/><br/> \"Have you ever tried making a business out of selling dwarven ale to people from other continents than the northern one?\" Daren asks. \"I bet it would sell like hotcakes. Actually, why haven't any of the dwarves thought about doing something like this? During all of my travels, I think I've only seen maybe one or two places selling dwarven ale, but not more than that. You would think that a drink as well-known as this would be one of the first things they'd try to export out of their homeland.\"<br/>\"Well, you see,\" Hadrik says, \"the problem is that most dwarves don't really like to stay away from home for long. They enjoy visiting other continents for short periods of time, but they wouldn't want to make a living selling alcohol there. And the merchants from your continents rarely come visit us, so it's not like we could just sell them the bottles so they'd deliver them to the rest of the world. Practically, the only way in which your people ever get to taste dwarven ale is when a dwarf visits one of your countries and shares his bottles with people from local taverns. That's how this particular type of ale has gotten so widely-known in your regions despite how hard it is to actually get it.\"<br/><br/>",

It's because of the people, I think. No matter who you're talking to, you always feel like you're in good company. It's a real shame that so many of the other giants can't understand this. It has been so long since the war between our two peoples ended, but I don't feel like their opinions of dwarves in general changed that much since then.

But the way that he died... from what you've told me, there were few ways in which he could have had a less honorable death. I wouldn't wish something like this even for my most hated enemies. Hell, even his corpse is just rotting somewhere in an underground cavern, with his head blown off and a hand which was mutilated so hard that the very nature of its existence was changed retroactively. I doubt anyone who knew him would recognize him if they saw his headless body right now.\"<br/><br/> \"Would you like us to retrieve his corpse and give him a proper burial?\" Daren asks.<br/>\"No...\" Hadrik says. \"As much as I dislike the way in which he died, that still doesn't change the fact that I don't owe the guy anything, and I'm not about to do him any favors even after his death. He made his own choices that led him there, and he has paid the price. That's all there is to it.\"<br/><br/>After he stops talking, Hadrik takes a long drink from his bottle and then he puts it down on the ground beside him.<br/><br/>\"Anyway, this discussion has gotten kind of grim, so you know...\" Hadrik says. \"Now is your chance to cheer me up.

Now she's pretty much acting like the team's coach and coordinator, and she's taking her role seriously too.

The one she had five thousand years ago, before she was trapped in a mountain, then forced to inhabit weak animal bodies and then put inside an amulet. We all saw how the Arraka from the past acted during the ritual. She was like a completely different person. She didn't crack jokes or kill people just for the sake of having fun. She had focus. I think that our Arraka's bizarre sense of humor is something that she's started developing after she was banished here, and after she realized that she couldn't find a way to go back to the magical plane. She only started messing around because she lost her initial purpose of getting her revenge on the gods, but now that she's regained it, she has also gained back her focus, so she is acting less like a jokester and more like her older self.\"<br/>\"Eh...\" Hadrik says. \"If you ask me, even the 'jokester' Arraka still had her moments. For example, her decision to not reveal my trial from the God of Time was taken before she started becoming serious. I'm still surprised that she actually waited for me to talk about it myself, instead of using it to make fun of me, to be honest. I guess even someone like her can show some basic decency from time to time.\"<br/><br/> \"Nah,\" I say. \"What this shows is that she's giving you preferential treatment.
