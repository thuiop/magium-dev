        "text": " Once again, the king of the underground and Albert exchange a look, but this time it is Albert who responds.<br/>\"We will prioritize the rescue of the prisoners that have family members here in the underground,\" Albert says. \"After those are all safe, we will see how many other people we'll be able to save without compromising the delicate infrastructure of this city.\"<br/><br/>\"So what you're saying is that you're going to abandon all the innocent people that you don't personally know or care about,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Nobody said we're abandoning them,\" the king of the underground says. \"We will at some point rescue them too, of course, but it will take time. This may be difficult for an outsider to understand, but many of the citizens of Ollendor are highly dependent on the use of their devices. For example, there are a lot of people in this city who would normally need to walk for hours to get from their homes to their workplaces, but with the use of the flying metal vehicles that you probably have already seen roaming the skies before the lockdown, they can get there in half an hour or less. If these metal vehicles were to suddenly stop functioning, many people would be out of a job, and they would eventually run out of money to buy food for their families. Would you like to take responsibility for ruining all these people's livelihoods just to make yourself feel better for saving a few extra prisoners?\"<br/><br/> \"Those 'few extra prisoners' have been living in hell for who knows how many months,\" Kate says, angrily. \"Don't you dare compare their situation to some lazy good-for-nothings that couldn't even be bothered to walk a few more hours to work so that they could feed their own families!\"<br/>\"I can clearly see that this situation is affecting you on a personal level,\" the king of the underground says, after seeing the fury in Kate's eyes. \"And I will admit that I may have overly-simplified the precarious situation in which these prisoners are currently finding themselves... However, I also think that your personal bias is causing you to make some unfair comparisons of your own. Maybe the example I used wasn't the most inspired one, but surely you could see how the sudden malfunction of the primary means of transportation in a city could cause its infrastructure to collapse in on itself, wouldn't you? There are even people who make a living by transporting goods from one end of the city to the other by using their metal vehicles, for gods' sakes... Could you even imagine how the people of Ollendor would react if every device in the city would stop working and thousands of people would suddenly be out of their jobs as soon as a new king were to take the throne? There would be riots of such magnitude that it could start a whole civil war!\"<br/><br/> \"So that's the real reason why you don't want to save those prisoners,\" Kate says, in a disgusted tone. \"It's because it would ruin your chances of holding on to your precious throne.\"<br/>After hearing what Kate had to say, the king of the underground closes his eyes and shakes his head in disapproval for a second or two.<br/><br/>\"It's clear that we're not making any progress with this conversation,\" the king of the underground says. \"Believe what you want. Either way, I think you've already gotten the answer you were looking for. Now perhaps it is finally time for us to have a little discussion about the Overseer, and the hold that he currently has over this city?\"<br/><br/>\"Maybe we should, yes,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>",

My days of being a royal guard are far behind me. For many years, I've been nothing more than a rebel and a citizen of the underground, like the rest of you. We are all equal here! Well... I suppose that some of us are more equal than others.\"<br/>As he was saying those last words, Sir Horace was looking straight at the king of the underground, waiting to see if he would respond to his provocation.<br/><br/>\"I see that you are still as popular as ever, Horace,\" the king of the underground says. \"I will admit that I didn't expect to see you on the other side of that door so soon. Your vitality never ceases to amaze me even after all these years I've known you.\"<br/><br/>\"Come on, 'king', you and I both know that my health is not the real subject you want to discuss with me right now,\" Desmond's brother says, with half a grin. \"I think the first thing you'd want to ask me is why I decided to come out of the quarantine area now of all times, especially after you only just paid me a visit to ask me nicely if I could stay inside there for a while longer so that you could run your little election without interference.\"<br/><br/>\"The thought has crossed my mind, yes,\" the king of the underground says.<br/><br/> \"Well, I'm going to be honest with you,\" Horace says. \"At first I wasn't planning to interfere, just like I haven't interfered with any of the other decisions that you've taken in the many years since we've been working together. We all know that you've done your fair share of shady stuff in the past, but most of it has been in the interest of our people, so I wouldn't really have minded too much even if you were going to run a sham of an election and declare yourself as king of the whole city. However... when I heard Kelrim talking earlier about how nobody would be on his side if he were to run for king... I don't know how to tell you this, but I was simply overcome with an emotion strong enough that it got the better of me, and so here I am!\"<br/>\"Once again, you are letting your feelings cloud your judgment,\" the king of the underground says. \"Have you stopped to consider what it would mean to propose a goblin as the new king to the people of Ollendor right after they find out that the old king was murdered? They're going to think that we sold them to the monsters! It won't matter if he has good intentions or not. They're going to want his head on a pike the minute after we announce our support for him.\"<br/><br/>\"Horace, I really appreciate the fact that you are taking my side, but I can't do this,\" Kelrim says. \"I am only a healer. I am neither a diplomat nor a skilled warrior. I have no leadership skills. I wouldn't even know where to begin.\"<br/><br/> \"Then I will help you,\" Horace says. \"I will be your right hand man. It's the least I can do to repay you after all the help you've given me in these last few weeks. You don't need to worry about whether you can do the job properly or not. All you need to worry about is whether you WANT to be king or not. This is what you need to decide. Do you want to be king or not?\"<br/>\"Do I want... to be king?\" Kelrim asks, looking as if he were finally starting to consider the possibility in earnest.<br/><br/>",

At most, they will elect him as the new king, thinking that you will be the real ruler behind the scenes. But if that is really how it's going to be, then what is the purpose of all these charades? Why not just challenge me directly? I'd much rather have you running against me in the election and winning than having you use some goblin healer as a proxy! Again I say, nobody in their right mind would vote for Kelrim if it weren't for--\"<br/>\"Did I hear that right?\" a man says, as he is getting closer to the king of the underground. \"Is Kelrim going to be running for king?\"<br/><br/>\"No!\" the king of the underground says, a little too loudly. \"We were only discussing it as a possibility! Nobody said he's actually--\"<br/><br/>\"Kelrim is running for king?\" says another man, who is quickly approaching us. \"I'll vote for him with both hands! My wife would have been long dead if not for him. He is a hero!\"<br/><br/>\"Did you hear that?\" I hear two men talking about a dozen feet away from us. \"Kelrim is planning to participate in the election. And Sir Horace said he'd be his right hand man!\"<br/><br/> \"Kelrim as king?\" the second guy says. \"That's the best idea I've heard all day!\"<br/>Once a few more people start to talk about it loudly, the news seems to be spreading like wildfire. Several people are already crowding up around us, for a chance to squeeze Kelrim's hand. Some of them are former victims of the plague, others are family members of the victims, while others are simply people that were helped by him since he came to the underground tunnels. As the whole area around us is getting filled with men and women of all ages, coming to express their support for the goblin healer, more and more people are getting curious to find out what the commotion is about.<br/><br/>\"Kelrim?...\" I hear a man in the distance, who appears to be one of the refugees. \"Is that the little guy who's been running around healing everyone until he almost fainted from exhaustion after the royal guards blew up the ceiling? He's running for king? I guess I know who has my vote, then!\"<br/><br/>\"What about the other guy?\" another refugee says. \"What was his name again? King of the underground or something? Isn't he still in the running too?\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, but that guy's shady as hell,\" the first guy answers. \"Who in their right mind would even vote for him after having Kelrim as an alternative?\"<br/>After hearing these last words, I check to see what the king of the underground's reaction is, out of curiosity. To my surprise, the man is like an impregnable fortress. You can clearly tell that he is consumed by rage if you've studied his facial expressions for long enough to tell the difference, but to someone who doesn't know him well, he would probably look as if he were completely unaffected by what's happening around him.<br/><br/>I guess I have to give credit where credit is due. I don't think I've ever seen someone with greater self-restraint than this.<br/><br/>",

I visited most of the major areas such as the mess hall, the living quarters, the infirmary and the recreation area, but sadly I couldn't really achieve much more than to confirm some of my suspicions. <br/>In pretty much every location that I went to, I would always run across some of the men that were strategically placed by Albert to sing the king of the underground's praises, but from what I could tell, there were a lot of people who weren't really buying it. There seemed to be plenty of men who were not exactly happy with the king of the underground's methods and who would happily vote for any other alternative that presented itself to them, and it also appeared that the king of the underground had a not-so-good reputation among the refugees coming from the surface.<br/><br/>From what I could gather, many of these refugees knew him as a mob boss of some sort, which isn't all that surprising, considering the dubious-sounding title that he chose for himself and his fondness for assassinating people that he doesn't like. There were also some refugees who seemed to have wrongly remembered his name as being king of the 'underworld' instead of 'underground', which makes him sound even more suspicious than he already is.<br/><br/> While I went around from one place to the other, I also took the opportunity to check up on my friends to see what they were doing whenever I was in the area. Kate and Arraka were in the middle of an argument when I found them. Seemingly, they were having a discussion about the origins of the various races in the world, and Kate was of the opinion that the reason why there are the exact same races on both the magical plane and the earthen plane is because both of these planes of existence originated from the primordial plane.<br/>Arraka disagreed with this hypothesis, saying that there was no solid proof to support her theory, and that even if these races were to have originated from the primordial plane, it would still not explain why the Magium has a system in place for creating new spirits in the magical plane with the exact same races as before.<br/><br/>Apparently, Arraka's theory is that the splitting of the primordial plane was an accident of some sort, and that the Magium is currently trying to patch it up like some sinking ship by artificially regulating the number of spirits on the magical plane and by using time weavers' prophecies on the earthen plane to try and avoid cataclysmic events that would cause too many people to die simultaneously. <br/><br/> She also seems to believe that the races we currently have in the magical and earthen planes have nothing to do with the original races from the primordial plane, and that they are also likely a result of the accident that caused the split.<br/>I didn't stay with them long enough to hear the end of their discussion, but it looked to me like Arraka hadn't really been all that successful in her attempts of convincing Kate to change her stance on the subject.<br/><br/>After also paying short visits to Hadrik, Daren and Leila, who were all still busy with the tasks that they set out to accomplish when we first split up, time flew by, and eventually every one of us was contacted by Daren so that we could finally meet up somewhere in an abandoned tunnel with no crystals and decide what we would tell the Overseer.<br/><br/>There was a rather long discussion, with everyone giving their own different opinions, but after expending a lot of effort I was finally able to convince my friends that our best course of action would be to...<br/><br/>",

Don't say I didn't warn you!\"<br/><br/>\"If doing a marathon means drinking slow sips every few minutes or so, then sure, I'm all for it,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Hahaha!\" Hadrik says. \"That's Daren for you!

It's like I'm always interrupting!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, it's not a surprise that you feel that way,\" I say. \"Even if your device is designed to translate your thoughts into words, I imagine that there is still a sizeable delay between the moment when you are having your thoughts and the moment when the device actually displays the text. Also, from what I've seen, you have control over the position of the text and its size too, so by the time you're done setting up all these variables, the brief point in time where you could insert yourself into the conversation without making things awkward is probably long gone.\"<br/><br/>\"Mhm,\" Leila writes, while looking at the wall in front of her as she slowly extends her legs. \"And even if I somehow manage to get the timing right, if I don't place the text in a spot that is visible for everyone, they might notice it too late and then I'd still be interrupting.

I think the voice you heard was the latest version of it, which is the one I'm using to think right now, because I could hear my thoughts echoing around me in the ethereal plane, and they sounded just like it. To be honest, when I made this voice I didn't really expect anyone other than me to ever hear it, so talking about it like this is a little embarrassing...\"<br/><br/>",

We've been completely avoiding this subject all night, and now that I see how reluctant we are to discuss it even after it's been brought up, I think I'm beginning to understand why.<br/><br/> \"I was really scared, you know... when it all happened...\" Leila writes, deciding to be the first one to break the ice after a long silent pause. \"I might not have let it show on my face, but I clearly remember that at the time I was overcome with a fear of the likes that I had never experienced before in my life.\"<br/>\"Yeah...\" I say. \"I was scared too... Even with my defective survival instincts, the fear of being trapped in that endless void again forever managed to get the better of me.\"<br/><br/> \"I... I don't think it was the idea of no longer existing that scared me the most at the time,\" Leila writes. \"It's rather... Do you remember that conversation we had in the tunnels about what would have happened if you had actually been erased by the Magium during the God of Time trials?... About how in a world like that I would have had to live my life trying to convince the others and even myself that you really existed and weren't just a figment of my imagination? I think... I think this is what I was really most afraid of. The thought of losing you in such a horrible way... it would have simply been too much for me to bear...\"<br/>As Leila is done writing her words, I notice that her hand is trembling slightly and that she has a somewhat anxious look in her eyes.<br/><br/>",

I have all the bottles we need here in my backpack!\"<br/><br/>After Kate and Leila offer to take the second night shift, Hadrik, Daren and I walk out of the room to find a good spot without any crystals in the walls or ceiling, while the others go to sleep. Once we find a place that is far enough to not bother the others with our talking but close enough to see the entrance of the room where they're sleeping, the three of us seat ourselves on the floor in a way that we can all see each other's faces when we talk, and Hadrik begins to take out the dwarven ale bottles from his backpack.<br/><br/>\"Good gods, man,\" Daren says, after Hadrik takes out the sixth bottle. \"Just how many of these bottles do you have in that backpack of yours?\"<br/><br/>",

It's practically tailor-made for drunkards like me! But anyway, we've talked enough about this. My throat is getting dry already. Let's have a toast!\"<br/><br/> \"Cheers!\" we all say, as we clink our bottles and then drink from them.<br/>\"You know, if you really want to cheer me up, you're gonna need to take longer sips than that,\" Hadrik says, with a grin. \"Your bottles look like you never even touched them.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, but we also get drunk much easier than you, since you're a giant, and you've also had plenty of time to build up tolerance to this type of alcohol,\" I tell Hadrik. \"You've been drinking dwarven ale for what... fifty years now?\"<br/><br/>\"Honestly, I've lost count,\" Hadrik says. \"But yeah, I started drinking more heavily since I moved to the dwarven lands, and it's been a while since then. Still, even after all these years, I can't say that my tolerance compares to that of most dwarves I've met in the taverns I frequent. It's like those little guys have livers made of elven steel. It's no wonder that they needed to invent a type of alcohol as strong as dwarven ale. Everything else would probably taste like water to them!\"<br/><br/> \"Have you ever tried making a business out of selling dwarven ale to people from other continents than the northern one?\" Daren asks. \"I bet it would sell like hotcakes. Actually, why haven't any of the dwarves thought about doing something like this? During all of my travels, I think I've only seen maybe one or two places selling dwarven ale, but not more than that. You would think that a drink as well-known as this would be one of the first things they'd try to export out of their homeland.\"<br/>\"Well, you see,\" Hadrik says, \"the problem is that most dwarves don't really like to stay away from home for long. They enjoy visiting other continents for short periods of time, but they wouldn't want to make a living selling alcohol there. And the merchants from your continents rarely come visit us, so it's not like we could just sell them the bottles so they'd deliver them to the rest of the world. Practically, the only way in which your people ever get to taste dwarven ale is when a dwarf visits one of your countries and shares his bottles with people from local taverns. That's how this particular type of ale has gotten so widely-known in your regions despite how hard it is to actually get it.\"<br/><br/>",

Is that why you don't see many dwarves actually living in the Western Continent, unlike the people from my continent, who moved in droves there when they had the first opportunity, because of the ideal weather conditions?\"<br/>\"Yeah, the dwarves must really like the cold, I guess,\" Hadrik says. \"Although, I will admit that there is a certain charm to that place once you get used to it. It's because of the people, I think. No matter who you're talking to, you always feel like you're in good company. It's a real shame that so many of the other giants can't understand this. It has been so long since the war between our two peoples ended, but I don't feel like their opinions of dwarves in general changed that much since then. Even someone like Gontrok, who is a shapeshifter and can shrink down to their size to talk, still acts the same way as--\"<br/><br/>He pauses.<br/><br/>\"Dear gods, I'm talking about him as if he were still alive,\" Hadrik says. \"What's wrong with me? I've barely even touched this bottle and I'm already spewing nonsense.\"<br/><br/> \"Weren't you two friends before you had your falling out, during the war?\" I say. \"Maybe that's the reason why you haven't gotten used to the idea of his death, yet.\"<br/>\"I don't think there was ever a period in my life where I could have called Gontrok a friend,\" Hadrik says. \"At most I could have called him a comrade-in-arms, back when we were fighting on the same side. But the way that he died... from what you've told me, there were few ways in which he could have had a less honorable death. I wouldn't wish something like this even for my most hated enemies. Hell, even his corpse is just rotting somewhere in an underground cavern, with his head blown off and a hand which was mutilated so hard that the very nature of its existence was changed retroactively. I doubt anyone who knew him would recognize him if they saw his headless body right now.\"<br/><br/> \"Would you like us to retrieve his corpse and give him a proper burial?\" Daren asks.<br/>\"No...\" Hadrik says. \"As much as I dislike the way in which he died, that still doesn't change the fact that I don't owe the guy anything, and I'm not about to do him any favors even after his death. He made his own choices that led him there, and he has paid the price. That's all there is to it.\"<br/><br/>After he stops talking, Hadrik takes a long drink from his bottle and then he puts it down on the ground beside him.<br/><br/>\"Anyway, this discussion has gotten kind of grim, so you know...\" Hadrik says. \"Now is your chance to cheer me up.

We all saw how the Arraka from the past acted during the ritual. She was like a completely different person. She didn't crack jokes or kill people just for the sake of having fun. She had focus. I think that our Arraka's bizarre sense of humor is something that she's started developing after she was banished here, and after she realized that she couldn't find a way to go back to the magical plane. She only started messing around because she lost her initial purpose of getting her revenge on the gods, but now that she's regained it, she has also gained back her focus, so she is acting less like a jokester and more like her older self.\"<br/>\"Eh...\" Hadrik says. \"If you ask me, even the 'jokester' Arraka still had her moments.
