Tell me, are you all ready to begin our adventure?\"<br/><br/>\"If by adventure, you mean waiting in line for an hour, then yes,\" Daren says, as he points towards the city's northern gate.<br/><br/>There seem to be at least a few dozen groups of people currently lined up on the main road leading to the northern gate. Some of them are just travellers, like us, but most of them appear to be merchants, with carts full of wares that need to be inspected one by one by the guards at the city's exit, before they are allowed to pass through the gate. Judging by how long it's taking the guards to inspect each cart, I'd say that Daren's estimation might actually be a bit optimistic. We're probably going to be stuck here for a lot longer than one hour.<br/><br/>\"Ah, yes,\" Melindra says, as she takes a glance towards the very long line of carts in front of her. \"I forgot that the northern gate is primarily used by merchants in this city. It would have been so much nicer if they actually made more than one gate on their northern wall, to solve their traffic problems.\"<br/><br/> \"More gates means more vulnerable areas that need to be protected,\" Daren says. \"It would not be a good idea in times such as these, when monster attacks are rampant. Let's just line up like all the others. The sun is barely up, so we'll have plenty of time to travel even if we waste another hour in this city.\"<br/>\"Actually, I have a better idea,\" Melindra says. \"We'll be taking a shortcut!\"<br/><br/>\"A shortcut?\" Hadrik asks, confused. \"You mean, like an underground tunnel, or...\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, no, no...\" Melindra says, with a smile. \"I wasn't talking about a tunnel.\"<br/><br/>She then snaps her fingers, and we all begin to slowly get raised into the air, higher and higher, as I feel several currents of air moving around me, in a similar fashion to how they used to move when I was using air magic to fly, during my battle with the skeleton stillwaters.<br/><br/>",

I repeat. You are to descend at once! If you ignore this warning, we will treat you as an enemy of the kingdom, and we will open fire! I will not repeat this again!\"<br/><br/>",

By the time we all make it to the ground, right outside the city walls, the captain of the guards is already waiting for us impatiently, with a few of the other guards accompanying him, as his escorts. The captain is a dwarf, of around the same size as Hadrik, wearing heavy armor, with a long brown beard covering the bottom half of his face, and a steel helmet covering much of the rest, aside from his eyes and his nose. <br/>As soon as we reach his position, Daren and I quickly begin to explain to him what happened, while repeatedly reassuring him that we were not looking to start a fight, when we flew over their walls.<br/><br/>\"Ugh...\" the captain of the guards says with his eyes closed, as he rubs his forehead, while shaking his head in disapproval. \"You know, if you really needed to leave the city in a hurry, you could have just asked one of the guards by the gate. We were all there when you people fought the dragon yesterday, together with king Golmyck, so it wouldn't have been a problem to do you a small favor in return for your service. Listen, I'm going to try my best to keep this incident off the records, but please, for the love of all the gods, don't do this kind of crap anymore. We guards are busy enough as it is. We don't have time to deal with your shenanigans.\"<br/><br/> \"Of course...\" Daren says. \"Thank you for your understanding! And I apologize again, in the name of our group. I hope that the next time we meet, it will be under better circumstances.\"<br/>Daren and I then turn back towards the others, and we signal to them that we're good to go.

There's no need for us to take such precautions, though. Most of you are powerful mages, right? Well, nowhere near as powerful as I am, but still...\"<br/><br/>\"Can you stop with the condescending remarks?\" I tell her. \"It's clear that your level of power cannot even compare to that of Eiden.

Not long afterwards, we feel a very powerful wind coming towards us, as we watch the air currents below Melindra spinning faster and faster, until they turn into a full-blown tornado. <br/><br/>Dozens of trees are now getting pulled from their roots and being lifted into the air by the giant twister in the distance, and even large rocks underneath the soil are starting to break off from the ground.

Once the twister has dissipated into the air, Melindra comes flying back, and she lands in front of us, with a victorious smile on her face.<br/><br/>\"How was that for a demonstration of my powers?\" she says.<br/><br/>\"Okay, okay...\" I say. \"You win this round.

You can sharpen it like any other element. You can reinforce it.

At the beginning, it was pretty obvious for everyone that Melindra was making an effort to even walk straight, but her situation gradually improved as we advanced through the forest, probably as a result of her magical energy getting slowly restored as she walked.<br/><br/> \"So...\" I say to Melindra, as we travel through the area filled with craters and fallen trees caused by the earlier tornado. \"Do you still remember our discussion from yesterday?

Since I was also in charge of serving dishes, and I had access to the kitchen, I offered to sneak some better food into his cell, every once in a while, in exchange for certain rocks from the pile in his corner. At first, he thought that I wasn't being serious, and he accepted the trade, somewhat in jest. But when he actually saw me bring him the food, while holding out my hand, waiting for my hard earned prize, he looked rather shocked. I had to point several times towards the rock that I wanted before he actually gave it to me. He also seemed to be amused every time I referred to our bargains as even trades, but I'm not sure exactly why. He never told me the reason.\"<br/>As Melindra talks, I suddenly remember my first conversation with Eiden, when I also offered him my own version of an 'even trade'. After hearing this story, I think I'm starting to understand a bit better why he burst out laughing like that when I made my proposition to him.<br/><br/>\"You collect rocks?\" Flower says, all of a sudden. \"Do you still have them with you?\"<br/><br/>\"Why, of course!\" Melindra says. \"I always carry them with me. My collection has gotten a lot larger in the past six hundred years, but I still have those original rocks that I started my collection with here in my backpack. Do you want to see them?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes!\" Flower says, excited. \"I'd love to!\"<br/>\"Well, okay, but just so you know, I won't be slowing down my pace,\" Melindra says. \"If you want to see them, you'll have to join my side, and I'll show them to you as we walk.\"<br/><br/>\"Of course!\" Flower says, as she rushes by Melindra's side.<br/><br/>The stillwater girl then takes off her backpack, and she begins to take out her rocks one by one, handing them over to Flower so she can get a good look at them, and then putting them back inside when she's done. As I was suspecting, none of the rocks seem to have any real marketable value, and they would look completely worthless to anyone else, but that still doesn't seem to stop Flower from marveling at every one of the rocks, while Melindra proudly explains to her the features that made her consider the stones to be worthy of her collection, making sure to also give her a brief summary of where she found each of them.<br/><br/>While Melindra and Flower are having their discussion, Daren gives the rest of us a signal, and we all slow down a bit to have a talk, outside of Melindra's hearing range, while still following her.<br/><br/>\"So, what do you all think about Melindra so far?\" Daren whispers, while making sure that Melindra isn't paying attention to us. \"Do you think that she might be working with Eiden?\"<br/><br/>",

You should be able to take them out without much trouble.\"<br/><br/>\" 'You' ?\" Daren asks. \"Don't you mean 'we'?

Don't be ridiculous. What would be the use of bringing you all the way to Ollendor with me if you can't even beat a few monsters by yourselves? Do you have any idea what good defenses they have in that city? How else do you think their king could afford to piss off every other kingdom in Varathia without getting killed off by now?\"<br/><br/> \"But what if the monsters kill us before we get there?\" Daren says.<br/>\"Then I'd have to find somebody else to help me,\" Melindra says. \"Someone who could kill off a few orcs without complaining so much.

Is it because ogres are bigger and heavier than orcs?\"<br/><br/>\"I said be quiet!\" Kate says. \"If you're not going to be useful, then at least stay out of our way, and don't distract us with your talking.\"<br/><br/>",

One of them is wielding two flaming double-edged battleaxes in his hands, another one is wielding a two-handed broadsword that is almost as big as him, and the other three are all using maces and shields that appear to be made from high quality metal.<br/><br/>The orc with the flaming axes seems to be the leader of the group. He is the one that shouted the first battle cry, and all of the other orcs followed his directions, as he led the charge towards us, and as he clashed directly with Daren.<br/><br/>\"Watch out!\" we see Leila's writing, in large blue letters, in front of us. \"They're one of the dragon's elite squads! Do not take them lightly!\"<br/><br/> She then dashes behind one of the orcs that is less heavily armored, and she stabs him in the back with both her daggers. The orc roars, and he turns around, swinging his mace at her. His movements are much too slow for Leila, however, so she quickly dashes back, out of his reach, and tries to attack him again.<br/>\"Leila, behind you!\" Kate shouts, as another one of the orcs tries to position himself behind Leila, in order to strike.<br/><br/>Kate then attempts to impale the monster with a spike made of ice that appears from the ground, in front of him. The orc manages to smash the icy spike with his enchanted mace, but he loses his momentum, and doesn't get to attack Leila anymore, who quickly slides out of his reach.<br/><br/>\"I'll take the ogres,\" Hadrik says, as he rushes towards the two ogres that were trying to jump us from behind.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Flower engulfs one of the orcs in a pillar of fire, but he walks out of it completely unscathed, thanks to his anti-magic armor, and he starts running towards her, with his broadsword at the ready.<br/><br/>\"Damn it!\" Flower says, as she jumps out of the orc's way and rolls on the ground.<br/><br/>Once I get a clear shot of the orc that attacked Flower, I aim my crossbow for the narrow slit in his helm, and I pull the trigger.<br/><br/>",

Daren seems to have his hands full, fighting the orc captain with the flaming axes. The orc appears to have completely thrown away his defense, and he is focusing on delivering relentless attacks, one after the other, in order to not give Daren the chance to retaliate. Hadrik is still fighting the ogres behind us, and from what I can see, they are giving him just as much trouble as the ogre captain from the fort, so he'll probably still be busy with them for a while.<br/>In the meantime, Leila is fighting three orcs at once, in an attempt to keep them away from our spell casters, while Kate, Flower and Illuna are all struggling to find ways to penetrate the orcs' anti-magic armor.<br/><br/>\"I can't believe you people!\" Arraka shouts, from her amulet, as Flower tries to aim a fireball in a way that would not hit Leila, along with the orcs. \"You were fighting the dragon head-on yesterday, but now you can't deal with a few of his lowly mooks? Are a bunch of anti-magic armors really all it takes to throw you into disarray?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I'll have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed, here,\" Melindra says, as she calmly looks around her, at all the people who are fighting for their lives. \"If this is how these people handle a well-organized team of reasonably-skilled combatants, I shudder to think how they will handle Ollendor's numerous teams of mercenaries.\"<br/><br/> Melindra's monologue appears to have caught the attention of one of the orcs that was fighting Leila, because he is now heading directly for the stillwater girl, with his mace at the ready. As soon as he reaches her, the orc swings his mace hard towards her, in an attempt to bash her head in, but the girl evades his strike by floating a few inches above the ground, while pushing herself away from him with a small burst of air from the palms of her hands.<br/>\"Quit it!\" Melindra shouts at the orc. \"Fight them, not me! What are you, stupid?\"<br/><br/>The orc ignores her completely, and he tries to hit her again, this time with his shield.<br/><br/>\"I said, cut it out!\" Melindra shouts at him, as she makes another jump backwards.<br/><br/>She then props herself into the ground with her feet, assuming a rather peculiar stance, as she bends her knees and keeps her elbows close to her body, while she faces her palms towards her attacker.<br/><br/>A very powerful burst of air then comes out of her hands, as the orc gets blown away, and thrown directly towards Kate, who was just about to launch an ice cone at one of Leila's opponents. Seeing the orc flying in her direction, Kate is forced to cancel her spell and to jump out of the way, in order to avoid getting knocked off her feet.<br/><br/> \"Are you trying to get us all killed?!\" Kate shouts furiously at Melindra, as she gets back up from the ground.<br/>\"Hey, it wasn't my fault!\" Melindra says. \"That orc attacked me out of nowhere, when I was just minding my own business!\"<br/><br/>\"This is the middle of a battlefield, you fool!\" Kate says. \"If you want to mind your own business, then fly away from here and stop sabotaging us at every step!\"<br/><br/>\"Well, there's no need to be so rude about it,\" Melindra says, as she casts a spell, and she flies high into the air, out of the orcs' reach, while the orc that she blew away earlier goes back to fighting Leila.<br/><br/>",

One of them was maintaining the suggestion spell, while the other one laid in wait, in a secluded place where he could not be disturbed, in case he needed to concentrate on casting the teleportation spell, after receiving the signal to retreat.\"<br/><br/>\"Let's get back to the others,\" I say. \"Hopefully, everyone is alright.\"<br/><br/>As we get back to the area where all the fighting took place, we soon find out that not everyone had managed to walk out of the conflict completely unscathed. Leila is now lying on the ground, with her left ankle red and swollen, as Daren is kneeling beside her, while holding his hands slightly above her wound, with a bright white light coming out of them.<br/><br/>\"You just need to bear with this for a little longer,\" Daren says, as he sees Leila grimacing from the pain, without making any sounds. \"The healing spell is almost done.\"<br/><br/>\"Gods, what happened here?\" Flower says.<br/><br/> \"Leila managed to kill two of the orcs she was fighting by herself,\" Daren says, \"but the third one crushed her leg with his mace before she got the time to retreat. At least this gave Kate the opening she needed to aim one of her ice cones through the open slit in his helm, in order to finish him off, but the wound that Leila took was no joke. It looks much better now than it did before. Anyway, after the three orcs got killed, their captain jumped away from me and he blew in his horn, to sound the retreat. What happened to the goblins? Did they get away along with the other monsters?\"<br/>\"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"We didn't manage to reach them in time because they had a suggestion spell that was keeping us away from them. They got the signal to retreat before we could find a way to get around the spell's effects.\"<br/><br/>\"But where did they go?\" Hadrik says. \"Are they planning to ambush us again?\"<br/><br/>\"Nah,\" Arraka says. \"They're gone. If I can't sense them, then they've probably retreated back to their main headquarters. Wherever that is.\"<br/><br/>\"There, it's healed,\" Daren says, as Leila's ankle goes back to its normal color and size. \"But not completely. You shouldn't try any more acrobatic stunts for at least a day, until you fully recover. You should be able to walk without much trouble, though.\"<br/><br/>\"Thank you...\" Leila writes, as she gets up from the ground.<br/><br/>",

And if you're already willing to wear full heavy armor, a helmet isn't exactly going to weigh you down a lot more, is it?\"<br/><br/>\"It's not about the weight,\" Daren says. \"It's about being aware of my surroundings. These mindless brutes might be okay with losing their peripheral vision over some extra defense, but when you're on a battlefield with enemies coming from every side, limiting your vision is the last thing any sane person would want to do! Then there's also the fact that this scar I have on my forehead makes me easily recognizable to most people nowadays, and when people recognize me, they usually tend to get intimidated, and not engage me in battle, which helps avoid some unnecessary bloodshed.\"<br/><br/>\"How did you get that scar, anyway?\" Hadrik says. \"I've never asked. And why is it shaped like an 'x'? Is there like a monster with an 'x' shaped tail that I don't know about, or something?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Daren says. \"The 'x' is actually formed from two separate scars that I got during the same battle.\"<br/><br/> \"Oh?\" Hadrik asks, suddenly getting more interested. \"Someone was actually strong enough to scar the great hero Daren twice during the same battle? May I ask who this was?\"<br/>\"It was my martial arts and enchanting master,\" Daren says. \"An ex-sage from the Southern Continent. Well, he wasn't a sage back when he was training me, but he became one afterwards, and he lost the title in the next year. He was an extremely harsh teacher, especially when it came to martial arts, and he was the type that always tried to make you learn lessons from your own experience, rather than just giving you the answer himself. As his final lesson, he told me to fight him with all my strength, by using everything he's ever taught me. This is when I got my two scars. The first time he wounded me, I did not understand his lesson, so he decided to cut me a second time, in the exact same spot, from the opposite side, in order to properly get his point across. Only then, did I realize that the whole purpose of that battle was to show me a huge weakness in my fighting style that I'd ignored for years, without giving it much thought. The third time when he attacked me in the same spot, I was ready for him, and I quickly disarmed him, which concluded my last lesson. Now, every time I see my reflection in the water, it reminds me to always remain vigilant, and to always look out for even the tiniest of weaknesses, because in a real battle, they can mean the difference between life and death.\"<br/><br/> \"Huh...\" Hadrik says. \"That's actually oddly inspiring. I think I may also have some of these small weaknesses that I never really bothered to correct because I didn't consider them to be that big of a problem, due to my durable giant skin, but after hearing your story, I'm thinking that maybe I should get off my arse and actually do something about it, before it's too late. After all, you never know what might happen!\"<br/><br/>",

Take as long as you like.\"<br/>\"What are you--\" Daren starts to say, as he looks towards Melindra, but he interrupts himself. \"Ugh... Yes, Melindra, you can come down, now.\"<br/><br/>\"Splendid,\" Melindra says, as she dives down towards us, reaching the ground level in a few seconds. \"Just so you know, the battle you had just now with the monsters was far below my expectations. You're going to have to clean up your act if you actually plan to be of any use to me when we get to Ollendor.\"<br/><br/>\"Listen, Melindra...\" Daren says. \"You may have taken an oath to uphold your end of the bargain, but none of us took an oath to fulfill ours. You may have forgotten about this, but we can still cancel this deal at any time, if we don't want to work with you anymore. And with the way you've been acting so far, you've given us some pretty good reasons to reconsider our arrangement. So, I'll tell you what we'll do. If you still want us to help you with Ollendor, then you can stop complaining and lead us to where we need to go. If you don't, then I'm afraid you might have to go looking for some other group to do your dirty work.\"<br/><br/> \"Fine!\" Melindra says, frowning. \"If that's how it's going to be, then you won't hear another word from me.\"<br/>She then storms in front of us, and we all begin to follow her, one by one, into the depths of the forest. <br/><br/>\"So, uh...\" I say, as we all walk behind Melindra. \"Illuna, do you think those two goblins might have been part of Fyron's army? Could the goblin general be working with the dragon, now?\"<br/><br/>\"I highly doubt it,\" Illuna says. \"The dragon already has plenty of goblins under his rule. He shouldn't have any need for Fyron and his 'free' goblins. In fact, the only reason why Fyron and his group have survived for so long is most likely because the dragon doesn't really care about them. There is no pact protecting goblins, so Tyrath could very well destroy their whole camp by himself if he deemed it worthy of his time, and nobody would be able to stop him.\"<br/><br/>",

From what I understood, he left because of the very poor way in which the goblins were being treated by the dragon, and by the other monster races. They may be the most resourceful of the monster races, but physically, they are by far the weakest, and there aren't many mages born in their race either. As such, the goblins were always being forced to perform menial tasks, they were ridiculed by the other monster races, and they were almost always on the verge of starvation. When Fyron left Tyrath's army, and took his goblins with him, the dragon never bothered to stop them, because they were mostly irrelevant to him, and so, the goblins formed a new faction, calling themselves the 'free goblins'. Only a fraction of the goblins actually followed Fyron, though. Most of them preferred to stay behind, because at least the dragon would ensure their protection against animals and humans, and he would give them enough food to scrape by. Even some of the goblins that left with Fyron decided later to return to the dragon, due to the even poorer conditions that they were getting in Fyron's camp.  However, those who decided to stay, eventually managed to make a better life for themselves than they used to have, after a few long years of hard work and effort, and in time, they managed to get other goblins, and even other types of monsters to willingly join their camp.\"<br/><br/> \"Hold on a minute, there,\" Daren says. \"Who exactly is this Fyron, and why are you both acting like you've met him before?\"<br/>\"Fyron is the general of the free goblins of Varathia,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Okay, and how do you guys know him?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Illuna has known him since before she met us, I think,\" I say. \"I met him while I was walking around the underground tunnels of the arena with Leila, trying to sabotage the event.\"<br/><br/>\"You were trying to sabotage the--\" Daren says, shocked, but he stops mid-sentence, and he shakes his head. \"Oh, boy...

They are not as strong as the ogres, but they're not dumb like them, either, and they are generally more powerful than most humans. The orcs are the main force of the dragon's army, but he also has other monsters of the humanoid variety like ogres, trolls and goblins, alongside various creatures such as wyverns and hydras. While it would be pretty unlikely to meet an orc in Varathia that does not serve Tyrath, there are plenty of ogres that have nothing to do with the dragon, like the ones we fought in the fort, and the trolls are mostly a race of mercenaries, so their allegiance to the dragon is fickle. As far as the goblins go, I'd wager that most of the goblins in Varathia still follow Tyrath, although Fyron has also been getting some new recruits in his camp, lately.\"<br/><br/> \"Hold on a minute, there,\" Daren says. \"Who exactly is this Fyron, and why are you both acting like you've met him before?\"<br/>\"Fyron is the general of the free goblins of Varathia,\" Illuna says.<br/><br/>\"Okay, and how do you guys know him?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Illuna has known him since before she met us, I think,\" I say. \"I met him while I was walking around the underground tunnels of the arena with Leila, trying to sabotage the event.\"<br/><br/>\"You were trying to sabotage the--\" Daren says, shocked, but he stops mid-sentence, and he shakes his head. \"Oh, boy...

I was way too focused on my fight with the orc captain to be able to pay attention to my surroundings, so I can't say for certain, but I think that one of the main problems in the way we organized ourselves was the fact that Leila jumped in to attack all those orcs by herself, which forced all of our spell-casters to concentrate only on the orcs that were fighting her, instead of say... dealing with the ogres, who did not appear to be wearing anti-magic armor, and who would have been easier targets for them.\"<br/>\"Sorry...\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"Oh, there's no need for you to apologize!\" Daren says. \"I know that you were trying to act as a decoy, in order to keep the attention off our elementalists, and that's a great tactic, but it just didn't work well for this situation. That's why we're having this discussion, in order to learn from our mistakes, and to improve our tactics for later battles. For example, maybe the next time you want to act as a decoy, you could try to keep your distance from your enemies, instead of actually engaging them in battle, so that you wouldn't put yourself into any immediate danger, which would allow our casters to also pay attention to the rest of the battlefield, without feeling obligated to jump to your aid.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, I'll try...\" Leila writes.<br/><br/> \"Also,\" Daren says, \"the next time Hadrik says he'll 'handle the ogres', it doesn't mean that you need to let him handle them all by himself. He may be strong enough to not get himself killed, but if either one of you helped him kill those ogres, he could have made mincemeat out of the orcs, without breaking a sweat. And when I say either one of you, I'm talking especially about you, Kate. A few well-placed ice cones should have been enough to finish off those ogres, given how busy they were with fighting Hadrik. I know that Leila is your friend, but you can't just completely ignore your surroundings every time she is in danger. If we're going to fight as a team from now on, you're going to need to put a little more faith in her fighting capabilities.\"<br/>\"I understand...\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Hmm?...\" Melindra says, as she turns around, suddenly appearing to gain an interest in our conversation. \"That is some very good advice coming from someone who hasn't been paying attention to his surroundings. Maybe I've been underestimating you a little bit...\"<br/><br/>\"Of course it's good advice,\" Daren says. \"I haven't spent the last twenty years fighting monsters for nothing. Also, didn't you say earlier that we wouldn't hear another word from you? Why are you talking to us all of a sudden?\"<br/><br/>\"Hmph!\" Melindra says, as she turns around. \"I wasn't talking to you. I was just thinking out loud. There's no reason for me to talk to any of you people.\"<br/><br/>",

Just this once. Come here, and we'll pick up from where we left off.\"<br/><br/>As Flower rushes again to Melindra's side, we all continue our journey through the forest, and for the next few hours, we do not get any more interruptions. For the duration of our journey, Melindra has not spoken again to anyone other than Flower, and the rest of us mostly ignored her as well. While we walked, we sort of split ourselves into little groups, with Kate and Leila in the back, Hadrik, Daren and I in the middle, and Flower and Melindra in the front. It seemed that Kate and Leila had a lot of catching up to do, so we decided to not bother them, and to let them have a little privacy. <br/><br/>On the opposite side of the group, once Melindra had finished showing Flower the rocks, she began to ask her a lot of technical details about how her fusion with Illuna actually works. Some of the questions were more personal than others, but it didn't seem like Flower was being bothered by them in any way, and she answered them all without hesitation, while Melindra was eying her with a look of sincere and eager curiosity. <br/><br/> When it got past noon, we decided to have a break near a river, in order to eat some meals, fill our gourds with fresh water and gather some fruits, so that Flower could conserve some of her magical energy by not creating food every time we needed to eat something. It would have been nice if the water that Illuna conjures were actually drinkable, because then we wouldn't have to worry about finding sources of fresh water, but from what she told me, the water that she creates with her spells disappears by itself after a while, so we might as well be drinking empty air.<br/>After I finished eating, I sat down on a rock, and I pulled out my notebook, to see if I could find any more of Eiden's loopholes while we were resting. While I was calmly flipping the pages of my notebook, I could see with the tail of my eye how Melindra was slowly closing in on me, although she seemed to have conflicting feelings about whether she wanted to talk to me or not, and she went back and forth a few times, before she finally decided to stop in front of me.<br/><br/>\"So, uhm... Barry... was it?\" Melindra says, with an obviously forced smile, while attempting to appear cute and approachable. \"How are you this fine day?\"<br/><br/>\"I see that you've finally bothered to learn my name,\" I say, as I casually flip a page from my notebook, without raising my eyes to look at her.<br/><br/>\"Yes, your name is easier to remember than the others,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>",

So, I was wondering who your parents are, exactly, and why did they leave this continent?\"<br/><br/>\"If you're talking about my real parents, then I most likely never met them,\" I say. \"I'm pretty sure that the parents who actually raised me were both regular humans.\"<br/><br/>\"They 'were' regular humans?\" Melindra says, intrigued. \"Not 'are'?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" I say, simply. \"They're dead now. They were killed by a banshee.\"<br/><br/> As I say these words, Daren, who was sitting on a rock not far from me, sharpening his sword, now seems to be paying a little more attention to our discussion. I suddenly realize that I never really told him how I met my first banshee.<br/>\"Killed by a banshee?\" Melindra says. \"And you weren't there when this happened?\"<br/><br/>\"I was there,\" I say. \"I'm the one who killed her.\"<br/><br/>\"You killed a banshee by yourself?\" Melindra says. \"But the only way someone as powerless as you could ever hope to defeat a banshee would be to attack her in her most vulnerable state, right after the awakening. Which means...\"<br/><br/>She pauses for a second, as realization dawns upon her.<br/><br/>\"Which means that the person who turned into a banshee was also part of your family, wasn't she?\" Melindra says. \"Your sister, perhaps? Cousin?\"<br/><br/>\"Sister,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"And you killed her with your own hands?\" Melindra asks, with a look of morbid curiosity in her eyes. \"How did the banshee look when she awakened? Did she really look like a genuine monster, like they say in the legends? What about your sister? Did it seem like she was still retaining a part of her consciousness, before the awakening process was over, or was she completely gone?\"<br/><br/> \"Listen, Melindra,\" I say, as I close my notebook and finally look her in the eyes. \"If we're going to be delving into subjects that we're uncomfortable to talk about, then I also have a few questions for you...\"<br/>I then lower my voice, in order to make sure that Daren can no longer hear me talking.<br/><br/>\"For starters,\" I say, \"why did you lie to us when you said that the reason why you weren't helping us fight the orcs earlier was because you wanted to test us?\"<br/><br/>",

Once Kate realizes what Melindra is doing, she turns her face away, in disgust.<br/><br/>\"Hmm...\" Melindra says, this time with a smile.<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, love,\" the first mage tells Melindra. \"We're not walking away anywhere. At least not until you guys empty your pockets and your backpacks, to show us if you have any pinecones with you...\"<br/><br/>\"Are you serious?\" Daren says, almost breaking into a laugh while saying that last word.<br/><br/>\"Heh,\" Hadrik says. \"I guess not every mage in the world can recognize you by your scar, eh, Daren?\"<br/><br/>\"That or they don't care,\" Illuna says. \"They were mad enough to join this tournament, after all.\"<br/><br/>\"We don't have time for this,\" Kate says, as she stops hiding her aura, and she shoots three ice daggers in front of the first mage's feet.<br/><br/> \"Aaah!\" the mage screams like a little girl, with a terrified look in his eyes, as he finally understands the situation he's in. \"A banshee! It's a banshee! What are you guys still standing here for? Run for your lives, you idiots! Run as fast as your feet can carry you!\"<br/>He then jumps over the small river, and he heads into the forest, as all of his companions hurry to follow their leader.<br/><br/>\"Are you going to let go of my arm, now?\" I ask Melindra.<br/><br/>\"Of course, of course!\" Melindra says, as she casually releases my arm. \"There's no need to be so upset. It was only a joke!\"<br/><br/>\"That's lovely,\" I say. \"Now how about you take the lead, like before, and leave me alone?\"<br/><br/>\"Will you come and walk by my side if I go take the lead?\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"I will do no such thing,\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Then I'll stay here, thank you very much,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Woah...\" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he looks towards us. \"Did something happen during that break we took earlier, Barry? Do you have anything that you might want to tell us?\"<br/><br/>\"Shut up,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"Leave them alone,\" Daren tells Hadrik. \"I'm sure that Melindra will get bored eventually, and then things will go back to normal.

        "text": " Just like Daren said, after about an hour or two of walking, Melindra finally got bored of pestering me, and she went to talk with Flower, who appears to be the only member of the team that she actually gets along with, so far. We spent the rest of the day travelling, without getting into any more fights, although we did run into several groups of mages, who seemed to be very busy gathering pinecones from trees, and stuffing them into their backpacks.<br/>When we decided that it was finally time to make camp, we started placing our tents not too far away from the river that we'd been following since noon. Melindra didn't really seem to want to spend time with our group any longer than she needed to, so as soon as she was done leading us, she went to the river bank, to see if she could find some more rocks to add to her collection.<br/><br/>As soon as we were done setting up the tents, I immediately pulled out my notebook, because there were a few things that I wanted to check before going to sleep. While I flip through the pages, I suddenly notice an old page where I wrote some notes about the stat device, and one particular phrase catches my attention. According to my old data, the stat booster was supposed to gather more energy from the air, if powerful spells were cast around it, but I've never actually seen this happen since I came to Varathia. Realizing that I may need more info on the subject, I decide to go ask some questions to the only other person in the camp that has more knowledge of stat devices than me.<br/><br/> As I go over to Leila, I notice that she was still in the middle of a conversation with Kate.<br/>\"Hey, Leila,\" I say. \"Got a minute? There was something I wanted to ask you about your stat device.\"<br/><br/>\"Of course...\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"Since when were you the studious type?\" Kate asks me, while raising an eyebrow, after seeing the notebook that I'm still holding in my hands. \"I've never seen you use that notebook before, but now you seem to be reading from it all the time.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I used to write in this notebook every day before coming to Varathia,\" I say. \"It's just that I kind of had to put that hobby to the side, for a while, because I was too busy fighting for my life in this godforsaken place.\"<br/><br/>\"You were going to ask me something about the stats?\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Yeah,\" I say. \"I wanted to know if you've ever felt like your stat device was receiving more energy from the air after a big mage fight had occurred in your vicinity.\"<br/>\"Not in particular, no,\" Leila writes. \"I mean, we just had that big fight with the dragon, yesterday, and neither of us got any stat points.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, exactly!\" I say. \"But according to the data I'd gathered before coming here, the stat device should not be gathering the energy selectively. And yet, I don't remember ever getting stat points after participating in a mage battle. Do you know why this might be happening?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know,\" Leila writes. \"I haven't really thought about it that much...\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I have a theory,\" I say, \"but I'm not exactly sure how accurate it is. You see, there was a time when I got to temporarily activate my hidden magical stats, but I only got the option to do it because there was a great amount of magical energy in the air around me at that time. The fact that the makers of the stat device included an option to quickly burn through the available energy makes me think that the energy would have been wasted otherwise, because the device wouldn't have been able to convert it all into stat points fast enough. Do you understand what I'm getting at?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"The energy residue from spells does not stay in the air very long after they've been cast. So, if the stat device cannot convert the energy fast enough, and if it does not have enough capacity to store it for later use, this would mean that in reality, most of the energy that the device is getting is not from spells, but from mage auras.\"<br/>\"That's what I was thinking,\" I say. \"But since the device can only extract a very low amount of energy from each person's aura at a time, this means that what really matters is not how powerful the people are, but how many mages there are within the stat booster's radius, which, if I'm not mistaken, should be around thirty miles, give or take. There would likely need to be hundreds of mages within the device's range, for the conversion to stat points to have any noticeable effect. That would sort of explain why the number of points I've been receiving have slowed down, lately, because a lot of mages have died since the beginning of this tournament, but it still wouldn't explain why we've been receiving fewer points while we were in the city.\"<br/><br/>\"Maybe it's because there were other people with stat devices gathered in Thilias,\" Kate says. \"Surely, you couldn't have been the only person to come up with the idea of bringing one with you to this place. And if you didn't know that stat devices would be mostly useless to people without lessathi blood running through their veins, then there were likely others like you, who didn't know that either.\"<br/><br/>",

I am, however, woken up barely an hour later, by the feeling of a pair of breasts slowly pressing themselves against my chest.<br/>As I quickly open my eyes to find out what's going on, I see that Melindra is currently trying to squeeze herself inside my tent, right next to me, but due to the relatively small area available inside, she's having a bit of trouble fitting in.<br/><br/>\"What the--\" I start to say, but I get interrupted by Melindra quickly shushing me, and putting her index finger on my mouth.<br/><br/>\"Shhhh!\" Melindra whispers. \"You're going to wake up the others! Hold on, let me cast a silencing spell on the area around us.\"<br/><br/>She then quickly whispers an incantation, and the sound of the crickets that I've been hearing until now suddenly stops, along with every other sound that is coming from outside the tent.<br/><br/>\"There!\" Melindra says, in a louder voice, with a triumphant look on her face. \"Now we can talk normally. Nobody outside the tent should be able to hear us.\"<br/><br/>\"What are you doing here?\" I ask her, as I slide myself to the opposite end of the tent, in the little space that is available to me. \"How did you even get here? Isn't Kate the one keeping watch right now?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, getting inside unnoticed was easy,\" Melindra says. \"I just had to cast an invisibility spell, and then I opened and closed the tent at a moment when the ice mage wasn't looking.\"<br/><br/> \"An invisibility spell?\" I say. \"You mean the one that also masks your aura?\"<br/>\"Yeah, that's the one!\" Melindra says. \"Eiden is the one who taught it to me.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" I say. \"So I've learned how you are here, but you still haven't told me why you are here. What do you want? And why couldn't this wait until morning?\"<br/><br/>\"Well, you see,\" Melindra says, \"when I checked the inside of my backpack this evening, I found out, to my dismay, that I'd forgotten to pack a tent before I left Thilias.\"<br/><br/>\"You've got to be kidding me,\" I say. \"And you couldn't just ask Daren or Hadrik to loan you a tent?\"<br/><br/>\"I don't know if you've noticed,\" Melindra says, \"but I haven't really been getting along very well with most of the members of your group since we left the city.\"<br/><br/>\"And your solution was to come and wake me up in the middle of the night?\" I say.<br/><br/>",

I only wanted to sleep inside your tent for a few hours, and to get out before you woke up. Hell, I even tried to sleep outside for a while, but there were just so many bugs trying to crawl on me, and the only protection spells I have that work while I sleep aren't made to guard me against insects!\"<br/>\"But why my tent?\" I say. \"Why not Flower's? Or Kate's?\"<br/><br/>\"Because I couldn't stand sleeping next to Arraka for more than two seconds,\" Melindra says. \"And your girlfriend hates my guts.\"<br/><br/>\"Kate is not my girlfriend,\" I say, simply.<br/><br/>\"She may as well be, judging by that ice cold look she gave me when I grabbed you by the arm,\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>\"Is that what you're basing your assumption on?\" I say. \"Kate gives ice cold looks to everyone. Except maybe Leila.\"<br/><br/> \"If you're under the impression that the ice mage doesn't have any feelings for you, whatsoever, then you are clearly in denial.\"<br/>\"Listen,\" I say. \"Kate has lived most of her adult life in the wilderness, fighting for her life. The only contact she's had with humans for the past ten years was either banshee hunters trying to kill her, or regular people running away from her, scared for their lives. She probably doesn't even know what feelings are, anymore. Kate didn't come here to have fun, and neither did I. She came here to look for her friend, and I came here to fight in a deadly tournament, in the hopes of achieving an impossible dream. Whatever it is you are seeing, it's not there.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, whatever helps you sleep at night!\" Melindra says. \"And speaking of sleeping, I think I'm ready to hit the sack. If you need anything else from me, just whistle. Nighty-night!\"<br/><br/>\"Are you serious?\" I tell Melindra, as I see her laying her head on the tent's floor, and closing her eyes.  \"You can't sleep here!\"<br/><br/>",

You get what I mean.\"<br/><br/>\"I can't tell if you are trying to compliment me, or if you're just insulting me right now...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Look,\" Melindra says, \"the bottom line is that there is nothing stopping us from having some fun for a few hours, and then calling it a day. There isn't even a need for me to drink the tea of infertility, because stillwaters are sterile and can't have children. And the silencing spell will still last for a good few hours, so it's not like anyone will be able to hear us. It's the perfect situation! Except for the small tent, that is... But nothing is perfect.\"<br/><br/> \"You know what?\" I say. \"You're right. I don't know what I was stressing about. Let's give it a shot!\"<br/>\"That's more like it!\" Melindra says. \"Oh, but I hope you won't mind if I cast an energizing spell on you before we begin. It's just that I've had men run out of steam after only a few minutes before, and I wouldn't want to repeat the experience.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, as long as the spell doesn't have any unwanted side effects...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Oh, there's no need to worry about that!\" Melindra says. \"There are no side effects. That I know of. And besides, I will also be casting it on myself, so it's not like you will be the only one affected by it. Anyway, get ready, I'm casting the spell!\"<br/><br/>As soon as Melindra is done casting the spell, I immediately start to feel the energy flowing all throughout my body. I feel as if I could run up and down a mountain, and then still have enough energy left to do a thousand push-ups. This spell is amazing! But it's very likely putting quite a strain on my body, so it probably wouldn't be wise to use it for too long. Well, a few hours won't kill me. Let's see how well this works.<br/><br/>",

I think Flower had the last shift, so if you can just avoid her, you'll be in the clear. I'll open this tent to see if the coast is clear, and if I give you the signal, you'll rush straight out, do you understand?\"<br/>\"Mmm...\" Melindra says, as she raises her head from the ground, with her eyes still half-closed. \"Mmhmm...\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, good,\" I say. \"I'm going to open the tent now. Get ready.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait, hold on!\" Melindra shouts all of a sudden, as she sees me pull on the tent's zipper. \"The silencing spell hasn't been canceled, yet!\"<br/><br/>As I finish opening the tent, I immediately regret my decision, because every single one of my teammates are currently standing several dozen feet away from me, and they're all now staring straight at me and Melindra.<br/><br/>\"Oh... right...\" I say.<br/><br/>",

Go bother someone else.\"<br/>\"Well, alright, then,\" Melindra says, with an unusually serious expression in her eyes. \"If you want me gone so bad, then I'll go. But know that you're going to regret this...\"<br/><br/>She then pulls on the tent's zipper, and she prepares to exit the tent.<br/><br/>\"Wait!\" I say. \"You didn't cast the invisibility spell on yourself!\"<br/><br/>Melindra ignores me completely, and she exits the tent, closing the zipper behind her.<br/><br/> Huh. Well, that didn't go so well. Maybe with a little luck Kate didn't see her walk out of my tent. Actually, what am I even worrying about? Even if she did see her, I should easily be able to explain what happened. And it's not like I'm worried about Melindra's threat, or anything. She's still under the oath's effect, so there's nothing she can do to me. I mean... it's not like she can actually do anything to inconvenience me if she can't even use her powers to hurt me.
