I forgot to tell you--\"<br/><br/>The loud horn drowns out the sound of her voice, as she is forced to close back her dome to defend from all of the incoming crossbow bolts. I'm not sure if she realized I didn't hear all of that, but there's no more time to stand here and wait.<br/><br/>I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. <br/><br/>Once I get closer, though, I start feeling a powerful urge to turn the other way. Of course. Kate's barrier. I had completely forgotten about it in my rush to get out of that battlefield. Was this what Kate was trying to warn me about?<br/><br/>I desperately try to keep going the right way, but without even realizing it, I always end up turning back. After running back and forth a few times, I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I realize I've been shot. One of the men that attacked us must have managed to catch up with me while I was wasting my time here, running around in circles. Before I even get the chance to turn around, I get shot two more times, and I fall to the ground, while my consciousness slowly fades away. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch3_daren_worry || 0) == 1) {%>I hesitate, but I decide to go with Kate's plan.

I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. <br/><br/>As I reach Kate's barrier, I start focusing on the cave, specifically, and after doing that, just as Kate said, my mind clears and I am able to continue on my way. When I finally reach our camp, I wake up Daren by shaking him violently.<br/><br/>\"Daren! Wake up! Kate's in trouble. You have to help. Quick!\"<br/><br/>\"What?... What time is it?\"<br/><br/>\"There's no time! You have to come with me. Please!\"<br/><br/>Daren quickly puts on his armor and follows me out of the cave.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch3_daren_worry || 0) == 1) {%>\"Good gods, Barry, just how far did the two of you wander off?\" asks Daren as we run towards Kate.<br/>I give him no answer and I start running faster. When we reach our destination, we notice everything is completely silent, and there's a lot of dead bodies in our way. Once we get within eyeshot of Kate, we start to understand why there are no noises coming from the battlefield. Kate is sitting on her knees, with her head bowed down, and both of her hands holding the hilt of an ice sword thrust into the ground. Both Kate and her ice sword are full of blood, and the ground all around her is littered with dead bodies. As she hears us approach, she raises her head slightly to look at us and says:<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, where are my manners? I should have left at least a few survivors for the two of you.\"<br/><br/>As she finishes her sentence, she lets go of her sword and falls face first on the ground.<br/><br/>\"Kate!!!\" shouts Daren as he rushes to her side. He starts casting his healing spell, but he appears to be having difficulties. After a few minutes, he finishes his spell, but Kate still hasn't woken up, and some of her wounds have not closed.<br/><br/>\"This kind of damage isn't going to just disappear with a simple healing spell,\" Daren says. \"She'll need quite some time to fully recover. At least she's no longer in any mortal danger. Would you mind telling me how the two of you got the bright idea to wander so far away from our camp without waking me up?\" <br/><br/><% } %>",

DIE!!!\" screams one of them, as he shoots his crossbow at me.<br/><br/>I lift another fallen tree off the ground, and use it as a shield to defend me from his crossbow bolt. I then wield it as a club, and use it to smash his head into the nearest rooted tree. As I lift my oversized club to gaze upon my attacker, I notice that nothing remains of the man's head, except for the red paste splattered on the trees.<br/> <br/>The other four men start screaming their lungs out. One of them is in such a hurry to leave that he trips and falls, another one literally pissed his pants, and the other two are running away as fast as their legs can carry them, and as far away from the battlefield as possible.<br/><br/>",

        "text": "I can't afford to keep running into enemies like this. My priority is their leader. I start moving more cautiously, making sure I get a clear view of my enemies before getting detected. I manage to avoid any resistance until I reach their leader's location. He's only got a handful of guards surrounding him. He was definitely not expecting an ambush. <br/>I take my time to silently neutralize all of the enemy's forces that are within hearing range of their leader, and then I quickly take out his personal guards, before they get the time to react. Their leader just realized what happened and is now screaming like a little girl. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.<br/><br/>\"W-W-What are you doing here?\" he asks. \"How did you get here? Guards? Guards!\"<br/><br/>\"Nobody's coming to help you. All of the crossbowmen in hearing range of you have been taken care of. It's just you and me.\"<br/><br/>\"N-N-No! Don't come closer. Stay back!\"<br/><br/>I grab him by the tunic, to make sure I have his undivided attention.<br/><br/>\"Listen to me. I don't care what country you're from, or how you got so many men to follow you here, but you are my hostage now. If you don't tell all of your troops to step out of the forest, drop their weapons and surrender, I am going to murderer you right here and now, and then I'll do the same to all of your guards.\"<br/><br/>\"No, wait! I can't!\"<br/>\"Of course you can. That horn you're holding in your hand also doubles as a magical voice magnifier, does it not? Now hurry up. I think my trigger finger may be slipping.\"<br/><br/>He reluctantly puts the voice magnifier to his mouth, and calls out to his troops.<br/><br/>\"Attention, all men! This is the duke of Bagelberry speaking. I have just been captured by the enemy. I repeat, I have just been captured by the enemy. You are all to step out of the forest, throw down your weapons and surrender!\"<br/><br/>The forest falls silent, as the crossbowmen's relentless attacks towards Kate suddenly come to a halt. They are confused, that much I can tell.<br/><br/>\"Didn't you hear me?! As your ruler, I COMMAND you to come out of that forest and drop your weapons! Now!\"<br/><br/>After a small delay, the first couple of crossbowmen start stepping out of the shadows, followed by a wave of a few dozen more men. Eventually they all step out of the forest, and throw their weapons at Kate's feet, declaring their surrender.<br/><br/>\"There, I did what you asked!\" says the duke. \"Now will you let me go?\"<br/><br/>\"And why would I do that? The way I remember it, all you offered us if we surrendered was a quick and painless death.\"<br/><br/> \"No!\" he yells in his girly voice as he's starting to cry. \"Please! I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life. Please!\"<br/>He throws a bag of golden coins on the ground as he throws himself at my feet. This is quite a lot of money. I could easily live most of my remaining life in luxury with just this amount.<br/><br/>",
