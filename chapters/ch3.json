It was as though I could feel the suffering of each of them, and the fear that went through their hearts as they took their last breath. What about you, Barry? What did you feel when you saw all those dead people?\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

Keep up the good work!\"<br/><br/>Slowly, Daren's smile fades away from his face and he adopts a more serious tone.<br/><br/>\"Listen,\" he says. \"I know your heart is in the right place. But you know as well as I do that women simply can't be born as mages. It's not in their blood. I don't know why she appears different from a normal banshee to you, and I don't know why the banshee inside her hasn't awakened yet, but it's only a matter of time. One day she will turn into a banshee, and I want you to be prepared when the time comes.\"<br/><br/>Daren takes a small device of his own out of his front pocket and hands it to me. It appears to be a magical transceiver. These devices are mostly used by soldiers, when they need to transmit information to each other over short distances, without having to shout to one another.<br/><br/>\"I want you to carry this with you at all times. If you're ever in danger, just tap this three times, and I'll come over to help as fast as I can.\"<br/>\"Just promise me something,\" I tell him.<br/><br/>\"Of course!\"<br/><br/>\"Promise me that you won't try to purify her until you see her transform into a banshee.\"<br/><br/>Daren sighs.<br/><br/>\"You're asking a lot of me, Barry.  You should know better than anyone how hard it will be to stop her once she turns into a banshee. But if it means that much to you, then I'll promise.\"<br/><br/>He pauses.<br/><br/>\"Come on, we should get going. It's time we wake up Kate so she can take second watch.\"<br/><br/>As we descend towards the cave, my stat device starts beeping. I pull it out of my pocket, and I see that I now have six more points available to spend. There must have been a big fight somewhere in the vicinity. <br/><br/>",

I realize immediately that what I've just seen was a premonition. But where did the dart come from? <br/><br/>I turn back, and start looking carefully towards the trees far in the distance.<br/><br/>As I look towards the forest, I spot two shadowy figures hiding behind one of the trees.  One of them seems to be holding a crossbow, and it's aimed right at Kate.<br/><br/>\"What happened?\" asks Kate. \"What are you looking for?\"<br/><br/>The man behind the tree shoots his crossbow but I was waiting for it. <br/><br/>\"Look out!\" I say, as I push Kate out of the dart's way.<br/><br/>\"You blundering buffoon!\" I can hear a man shout from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention. <br/><br/>\"How did you manage to miss that shot? Plan B! Go for plan B! Now!\"<br/><br/>Suddenly, all of the trees around us get covered in a cloud of smoke.

I'm starting to doubt that this bluff was a good idea after all.<br/><br/>\"Is this a joke?\" says Kate. \"I can sense that there's at least a hundred of you hiding behind the trees all around us.

If they bleed, they can be killed. And so can you.\"<br/><br/>After he finishes his phrase, he blows a very loud horn which drowns out all other sounds in the woods, and suddenly a rain of crossbow bolts comes flying towards us from every direction. Kate quickly makes an ice dome around us to block their shots.<br/><br/>\"Barry, can you see them through the smoke?\"<br/><br/>I take a look through her semi-transparent ice dome, and try to see if I can distinguish any figures through the distant smoke screen.

I forgot to tell you--\"<br/><br/>The loud horn drowns out the sound of her voice, as she is forced to close back her dome to defend from all of the incoming crossbow bolts. I'm not sure if she realized I didn't hear all of that, but there's no more time to stand here and wait.<br/><br/>I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. <br/><br/>Once I get closer, though, I start feeling a powerful urge to turn the other way. Of course. Kate's barrier. I had completely forgotten about it in my rush to get out of that battlefield. Was this what Kate was trying to warn me about?<br/><br/>I desperately try to keep going the right way, but without even realizing it, I always end up turning back. After running back and forth a few times, I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I realize I've been shot. One of the men that attacked us must have managed to catch up with me while I was wasting my time here, running around in circles. Before I even get the chance to turn around, I get shot two more times, and I fall to the ground, while my consciousness slowly fades away. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_ch3_daren_worry || 0) == 1) {%>I hesitate, but I decide to go with Kate's plan.

I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. <br/><br/>As I reach Kate's barrier, I start focusing on the cave, specifically, and after doing that, just as Kate said, my mind clears and I am able to continue on my way.

When we reach our destination, we notice everything is completely silent, and there's a lot of dead bodies in our way. Once we get within eyeshot of Kate, we start to understand why there are no noises coming from the battlefield. Kate is sitting on her knees, with her head bowed down, and both of her hands holding the hilt of an ice sword thrust into the ground. Both Kate and her ice sword are full of blood, and the ground all around her is littered with dead bodies. As she hears us approach, she raises her head slightly to look at us and says:<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, where are my manners? I should have left at least a few survivors for the two of you.\"<br/><br/>As she finishes her sentence, she lets go of her sword and falls face first on the ground.<br/><br/>\"Kate!!!\" shouts Daren as he rushes to her side. He starts casting his healing spell, but he appears to be having difficulties. After a few minutes, he finishes his spell, but Kate still hasn't woken up, and some of her wounds have not closed.<br/><br/>\"This kind of damage isn't going to just disappear with a simple healing spell,\" Daren says. \"She'll need quite some time to fully recover. At least she's no longer in any mortal danger. Would you mind telling me how the two of you got the bright idea to wander so far away from our camp without waking me up?\" <br/><br/><% } %>",

Alright, err, the next one is--\"<br/><br/>\"This is taking too long,\" Kate interrupts me, while conjuring floating ice shields left and right to defend us from the onslaught of crossbow bolts. \"I have an idea.\"<br/><br/>She creates two huge fans made of ice, right above the smoke screen on our left side, and they start moving by themselves and blowing the smoke away.<br/><br/>\"It's working,\" she says, as she conjures a few more to deal with the remainder of the smoke.<br/><br/>\"NO!\" shouts the man with the high pitched voice. \"Don't let her blow away the smoke!\"<br/><br/>It's too late, though. There are already hundreds of ice blades forming in the air, above Kate. She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. <br/><br/>One last crossbowman who managed to survive the onslaught is now making a run towards us, in a desperate attempt to get behind Kate and to shoot her before she notices him. Kate remains unphased, and she shoots an ice cone straight into his head, sending his corpse tumbling to the ground, while his crossbow drops from his hands and lands a few feet behind me.<br/><br/>",

Please!\" his tone of voice has completely changed, and he sounds like he's about to cry.<br/><br/>He throws himself at my feet.<br/><br/>\"I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament!

I killed him because once he would've calmed down, he'd have started procuring himself a new army, and he would have likely made it his mission to hunt us down, so that he could take HIS petty revenge on us. This was visibly a very resourceful man. It's not easy to convince a whole battalion of men to follow you to certain doom. I highly doubt he was the kind of person to easily let go of a grudge, either. And as I pointed out earlier, he most definitely didn't strike me as the merciful type. Don't you think we're in enough danger as it is, without adding some enemies that are looking to kill us, specifically?<br/><br/>\"I, uh... I didn't think of it that way.\"<br/><br/>\"No. You didn't. Now come on. Let's go back to our cave. We're done here.\" <br/><br/>I take the bag of coins and the rest of the treasure and follow Kate.<br/><br/>",

Maybe she used her magic to get him.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't be ridiculous, the banshee is barely even able to hold her ground.\"<br/><br/>While the men are arguing amongst themselves, I'm trying to find the right moment to distance myself from them. As I stand there and listen, with my back pressed against the tree, an arm appears from behind me, holding a knife in its hand. It quickly slices my neck, and blood starts pouring out.<br/><br/>\"Like a rat in a cage, heheh...\" I hear the man say, while I drop to the ground.<br/><br/>The last thing I see is the man's knife descending towards me, as he lands the finishing blow.<br/><br/>",

She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. <br/><br/>It appears she didn't really need my help after all.

The choice is yours.\"<br/><br/>Once Kate understands I'm not going to change my mind, she reluctantly forges an ice dagger and hands it to me. When I grab it, I realize the hilt is also made out of ice, but its shape makes it easy enough for me to hold on to, and this is not the time and place to whine about how cold it feels in my hand.<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" I say. \"Now open up the dome.

I start moving more cautiously, making sure I get a clear view of my enemies before getting detected. I manage to avoid any resistance until I reach their leader's location. He's only got a handful of guards surrounding him. He was definitely not expecting an ambush. <br/>I take my time to silently neutralize all of the enemy's forces that are within hearing range of their leader, and then I quickly take out his personal guards, before they get the time to react. Their leader just realized what happened and is now screaming like a little girl. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.<br/><br/>\"W-W-What are you doing here?\" he asks. \"How did you get here? Guards? Guards!\"<br/><br/>\"Nobody's coming to help you. All of the crossbowmen in hearing range of you have been taken care of. It's just you and me.\"<br/><br/>\"N-N-No! Don't come closer.

I can't!\"<br/>\"Of course you can. That horn you're holding in your hand also doubles as a magical voice magnifier, does it not? Now hurry up. I think my trigger finger may be slipping.\"<br/><br/>He reluctantly puts the voice magnifier to his mouth, and calls out to his troops.<br/><br/>\"Attention, all men! This is the duke of Bagelberry speaking. I have just been captured by the enemy. I repeat, I have just been captured by the enemy. You are all to step out of the forest, throw down your weapons and surrender!\"<br/><br/>The forest falls silent, as the crossbowmen's relentless attacks towards Kate suddenly come to a halt. They are confused, that much I can tell.<br/><br/>\"Didn't you hear me?! As your ruler, I COMMAND you to come out of that forest and drop your weapons! Now!\"<br/><br/>After a small delay, the first couple of crossbowmen start stepping out of the shadows, followed by a wave of a few dozen more men. Eventually they all step out of the forest, and throw their weapons at Kate's feet, declaring their surrender.<br/><br/>\"There, I did what you asked!\" says the duke. \"Now will you let me go?\"<br/><br/>\"And why would I do that? The way I remember it, all you offered us if we surrendered was a quick and painless death.\"<br/><br/> \"No!\" he yells in his girly voice as he's starting to cry. \"Please! I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life.
