The closest approximation I can give you is that I'm somewhere in my early six hundreds.\"<br/><br/>\"You're... more than six hundred years old?\" I ask him.<br/><br/>\"Yes, that's what I just said,\" Eiden says. \"Try to pay attention.\"<br/><br/>\"How could you?...\" Flower asks Eiden, while a tear flows from her eye. \"How could you kill all those people? What did the people of Olmnar ever do to you?!\"<br/><br/>\"To me?\" Eiden says. \"Nothing. But the people of Olmnar were the first ones who started hunting animals as a sport. They are the sole reason for the whole war that has started between the animals and the humans. They needed to be punished.\"<br/><br/> \"Punished?\" Flower asks, as her eyes turn red with rage once more. \"They all needed to be punished?! Even the elderly? Even the kids? Who gave you the right?! If anyone's, it should have been Eleya's decision to make, not yours!\"<br/>\"Oh, right, the old fox!\" Eiden says. \"I'd almost forgotten why I came here in the first place.\"<br/><br/>He turns to me.<br/><br/>\"Barry,\" Eiden says, \"did you know that the golden fox cast a tracking spell on all of you before you left the lessathi ruins?\"<br/><br/>\"A tracking spell?\" I ask. \"Why would she do that?\"<br/><br/>\"I do not know!\" Eiden says. \"But I'm suspecting that she must have taken an interest in you as well!\" <br/><br/>He then starts moving his index finger through the air, as if he were pushing some invisible buttons in front of him. After a while, a golden light starts shining brightly all around us, and a hologram of the fox's head appears in front of us, soon afterwards.<br/><br/>\"Eiden?\" Eleya says. \"Eiden, is that you?\"<br/><br/>\"Hello, old friend,\" Eiden says. \"Did you miss me?\"<br/><br/>\"Eiden, what are you doing?\" the fox says. \"Stop this at once!\"<br/><br/>The stillwater pays her no mind, and he continues to fiddle around with her spell, until he grabs onto what seems to be a golden string, made of solid light.<br/><br/> \"Eiden!\" Eleya shouts. \"Eiden, don't you DARE!\"<br/>Eiden smiles and waves at the fox, as he pulls on the golden string, and both the light surrounding us and the fox's head quickly disappear, with a loud clinking noise.<br/><br/>",

Allow me to give you a ride to your destination. Free of charge!\"<br/><br/>He snaps his fingers, and I suddenly feel my whole body compressing itself into a single point, as all of my senses fade for one brief moment, and when I wake up, I find myself standing in front of a huge stone wall that seems to spread for as far as the eye can see.<br/><br/>I turn to Rose, who seems to have recovered from her violent coughing, and who is now measuring up the walls with her eyes.<br/><br/>\"Rose, is this...\" I start to ask, but Rose answers me before I finish my question.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" she says. \"The city of Thilias. He wasn't lying.

Is he hiding invisibly again?\"<br/>\"No, he didn't teleport here with the rest of us,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"Could you let us know if you ever sense Eiden hiding invisibly around us again?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, sure, no problem,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"Really?\" I ask, surprised. \"Just like that?\"<br/><br/>\"Just like that,\" Arraka says. \"As long as I get to piss Eiden off, it's time well spent for me.\" <br/><br/>\"So, I'm guessing you and Eiden have a history, then?\" I ask.<br/><br/>\"Oh, yeah, him and I go way back,\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"Is that so?...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Flower...\" Kate says, as she comes closer. \"Are you okay?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm fine,\" Flower says, curtly, as she wipes the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand.<br/><br/>\"Do you need to talk, or--\" Kate starts to say but Flower interrupts her.<br/><br/>\"I'm FINE!\" Flower shouts.<br/><br/>",

That man is related to one of the kings of Varathia, and that girl is his slave. She is his rightful property!\"<br/><br/>\"She's his... what?\" Daren says, as his look darkens.<br/><br/>Rose hesitates for a second, when she sees the look in his eyes.<br/><br/>\"That girl is a slave...\" Rose continues. \"She doesn't have any rights, or freedoms. That man is legally  entitled to use her in any way he wishes, and to dispose of her whenever he sees fit.\"<br/><br/>Daren just stands there and looks at Rose for a few seconds, as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing.<br/><br/>\"You're saying this is normal?!\" Daren asks her, furious. \"Treating another person like this? Like they were nothing more than an object? Do you find this normal, Rose?!\"<br/><br/>Rose opens her mouth to speak, but no words come out for a few seconds.<br/><br/> \"Regardless of whether I'm finding any of this normal or not,\" Rose says, with a shaky voice, \"the fact remains that the tournament rules still prohibit you from attacking any of the locals. You saw what happened to that mage who tried to attack me in the forest. You'll just get teleported out of here before you even get the chance to do anything.\"<br/>Daren clenches his fist, as his hand starts shaking with rage, but he is unable to come up with a proper retort. Instead, he decides to turn his head away from her, and to continue watching the gruesome scene that was unraveling before our eyes. <br/><br/>\"I'm sorry,\" the girl says, as the man beats her mercilessly. \"Please, I'm sorry!\"<br/><br/>\"I didn't ask for your apologies, you little wench,\" the man says, as he looks at her now swollen face with disgust. \"I asked for you to be useful. How am I supposed to expect anything from you if you can't even carry a few bags?\"<br/><br/>Now that he mentions it, I realize that there are at least ten bags full of clothes and groceries lying on the ground next to the girl. They must weigh a ton.<br/><br/>",

Any of these people passing by could easily overpower that clown and save the girl. But they won't do it. Some of them would tell you that they're just obeying the law. Others would have you believe that they're only doing it to protect their families. But we all know what the real reason is. They're ignoring her because it's convenient. Because it's easier to lie to themselves and carry on with their lives than to face reality and try to give some meaning to their miserable existence.\"<br/>Upon hearing Eiden's words, Rose lowers her head, and she starts staring at the ground in silence.<br/><br/>\"But you're not like them, are you, Daren?\" Eiden continues. \"I'm sure you would have jumped to save that poor girl in an instant, were it not for the tournament's spell protecting the noble.\"<br/><br/>\"Shut up,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"It's quite a pity, isn't it?\" Eiden says. \"The fact that you're forced to stand here and do nothing, because of one meager spell.\"<br/><br/>Eiden smiles.<br/><br/>\"What if I were to tell you, Daren, that I had a way to circumvent that spell?\" he says.<br/><br/>\"I'd say that you were out of your mind,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>Eiden laughs.<br/><br/> \"You don't have to take my word for it,\" he says. \"Once I give you the power, you'll know that it's true. All you need to do is ask. Ask me for the power, Daren, and I will give it to you without asking for anything in return.\"<br/>\"You must have gone completely insane if you're actually thinking that I'd ever consider asking you for a favor!\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Oh?\" Eiden says. \"Then I suppose that you're content in leaving that girl to her fate, while you walk away like all the others?\"<br/><br/>Daren clenches his fist and bites his lip, but he doesn't say anything.<br/><br/>",

The noble had gotten tired of her repeated failures, and was just about to hit her again, but he got interrupted by Daren shouting at him.<br/><br/>\"Wait!\" Daren says, as he reaches him. \"You're hurting her!\"<br/><br/>The noble stands there and looks at Daren for a few seconds, as if frozen.<br/><br/>\"What are you, some kind of clown?\" the noble says. \"Or perhaps you get paid to state the obvious to people? What are you going to tell me next? That the sky is blue? That the sun rises from the east?\"<br/><br/> \"Don't you understand?!\" Daren says. \"She's human, just like you! She bleeds like you, she feels pain like you, she can get scared, she can be happy or sad. How can you do this to a fellow human being?\"<br/>\"She's not a fellow human being, you imbecile,\" the noble says. \"She's a slave. She's a form of existence lower than a worm or even an insect. Do you pause to think about the pain of every bug that you squish between your hands?\"<br/><br/>\"You can't be serious!\" Daren says. \"Do you not have eyes? Can you not see that she is the same as us?\"<br/><br/>\"No, outsider, it is you who cannot see,\" the noble says. \"I know that this is a difficult concept to grasp for a barbarian such as yourself, but I feel that it is my duty as a superior being to educate you.\"<br/><br/>The noble grabs the slave girl by the hair, and he faces her in Daren's direction.<br/><br/>",

The ones at the bottom serve the purpose of making life easier for the ones at the top. This way, the enlightened minds can focus on ruling, while the lower life forms can focus on the menial tasks that are more suited for them. The existence of slaves is one of the main reasons why our civilization is so much more advanced than that of all the other continents. Who do you think built that giant wall you passed through when you entered the city? Who do you think built the castles, or our complex sewage system? Slaves are the foundation of a healthy and advanced society and your inability to comprehend such a simple concept only proves that you are a product of a far more inferior civilization than that of Varathia.\"<br/>\"You're wrong!\" Daren says. \"This isn't civilization! This is inhuman! You're treating human lives as if they were nothing! It's not too late. You can still change. If you would just listen to what I'm saying...\"<br/><br/>\"I see that words are wasted on the likes of you,\" the noble says, disappointed. \"I don't know why I was expecting anything different.

No one will mourn her passing, no one will stop to look, no one will ever be affected by her death, and life will simply continue to move on without her, as if she'd never existed.\"<br/>\"Wait!\" Daren shouts. \"I didn't mean to offend you with what I said! Just please, put the knife down, and we can continue our conversation where we left off. Please!\"<br/><br/>The slave girl looks as if she has completely given up on any hope that she might have had left. The look in her eyes is completely empty, as she stares at the ground and waits patiently for the inevitable.<br/><br/>\"Look at that!\" Eiden says, to me. \"That oaf is going to get the poor girl killed.

You will thank me for this later.\"<br/><br/>\"Please, if you could just listen--\" Daren starts to say, but he doesn't get to finish his sentence.<br/><br/>With one swift movement of his hand, the noble slits the girl's throat wide open, and when he lets go of her hair, her body simply falls on the ground like a lifeless doll, as a pool of blood starts to slowly form beneath her.<br/><br/>\"No!\" Daren shouts, as he rushes towards the girl's body, and he tries to cast all of the healing spells he knows on her. \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no...\"<br/><br/> As he keeps repeating the same word, over and over, Daren's voice starts to tremble, and it doesn't take long for him to break down in tears, while he takes the girl's body in his arms, and he hugs her with all his strength.

All of the people who were walking down the street until now have suddenly stopped, and they are now all looking at the noble's corpse falling on the ground, with a terrified look in their eyes.<br/>All of a sudden, the silence is broken by Eiden's laughter. <br/><br/>\"Wonderful!\" he says. \"Wonderful! Let this image sink into your mind and your heart, healer. Let this mark the beginning of your road to despair. Let it never be forgotten. The day when you chose your worthless pride over the life of an innocent girl.\"<br/><br/>Daren screams, and he rushes towards Eiden, slashing his sword at him fiercely. Eiden floats into the air, out of his reach, and then he turns to me and Kate.<br/><br/>\"One last thing before I go,\" Eiden says. \"I think I should let you know that the spell I cast just now on Daren was an area of effect spell and not a targeted one. This means that it affected the whole area around me, and not just him. The two of you have been given the same gift as your healer friend. If you don't believe me, you can easily verify that I'm telling the truth by looking at any one of the people around you, and trying to imagine hitting them. You will see that the tournament spell no longer poses any resistance. The effect of my spell lasts indefinitely, so this power is yours to use as you please from this day forward. With this said and done, I bid you farewell!\"<br/><br/> Eiden then snaps his fingers, and he immediately disappears without a trace. As I do what he said and try to imagine hitting one of the townsfolk, I realize that he wasn't lying. When I imagined myself hitting the noble before, I definitely felt some sort of force that was trying to stop my very train of thoughts from forming, but none of that happened anymore.<br/>Taking a look towards Daren, I see that he is now calmly sheathing his sword and turning to face us. He has the same dark look in his eyes that he had before.<br/><br/>\"We're done here,\" Daren says, as he walks towards us. \"Let's go get Hadrik and Flower so we can all be on our way and leave this place behind us.\"<br/><br/>\"Daren, I...\" Rose starts to say, but Daren simply walks past her, without giving her a chance to speak her mind, and he heads towards the armor shop that Hadrik entered earlier.<br/><br/>When Hadrik saw us enter the shop to call for him, he seemed a bit disappointed. It appears that he would have liked to browse the shop's wares a bit more before leaving.<br/><br/>\"Why did you all come to get me so early?\" Hadrik asks. \"Weren't we gonna wait for Flower to come back?\"<br/><br/>\"Some... stuff happened which made us decide to pick another route towards my home,\" Rose says. \"We'll tell you all the details when we get there.

What Eiden said was completely true. I really have been turning a blind eye to this whole situation because it was more convenient that way. I have no excuse. Even if I can't change the way our society works, I can still try to help where I can. Seeing Barry tackle the problem so directly in front of my eyes gave me the courage to finally start doing something about it myself! And for now, the way I can help is to provide a home and a sense of purpose to this poor unfortunate girl.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, you're all patched up now!\" Daren tells Ella.<br/><br/>\"Thank you, sir,\" the girl says.<br/><br/> Now that her bruises are gone, and I get a good look at her face, I suddenly realize that Ella could very well give Rose a run for her money in a beauty contest. Even though her messy black hair and the tattered rags she's wearing aren't doing her any favors, her face has all the features that make a girl look beautiful without any makeup. She has a small nose, high cheekbones, full lips and large brown eyes, while her body's proportions seem almost perfectly balanced. If she'd lived a normal life, and she had attended a school like all other girls her age, she would have likely been very popular. Girls would have killed to have her in their groups, and boys would have courted her every single day. She would have had a life that most girls her age could only dream of. If she'd lived a normal life...<br/>\"Alright, then!\" Rose says, as she takes a sideways glance towards all the people who were standing on the side of the street, staring at us. \"We shouldn't linger here any longer. Let's go get Hadrik and Flower, and we'll take another route towards my house.\"<br/><br/>When Hadrik saw us enter the shop to call for him, he seemed a bit disappointed. It appears that he would have liked to browse the shop's wares a bit more before leaving.<br/><br/>\"Why did you all come to get me so early?\" Hadrik asks. \"Weren't we gonna wait for Flower to come back?\"<br/><br/>\"Some... stuff happened which made us decide to pick another route towards my home,\" Rose says. \"We'll tell you all the details when we get there.\" <br/><br/> \"Uh-huh,\" Hadrik says. \"And I'm guessing those details will also cover how you all recruited a new team member in my absence?\"<br/>\"You catch on fast!\" Rose says, with a playful smile.<br/><br/>\"Name's Hadrik,\" Hadrik says, as he approaches Ella, \"but most friends call me 'the dwarf'. Pleased to make your acquaintance!\"<br/><br/>The dwarf extends his hand towards the girl, but she gets scared, and she instinctively jumps back when he gets near her. Ella then looks at both me and Rose, seemingly asking for our approval, and when I nod to her, she hesitantly grabs Hadrik's hand and she shakes it weakly. <br/><br/>\"You've never really met a dwarf before, have you lass?\" Hadrik asks Ella, with a grin.<br/><br/>\"It's a bit more complicated than that,\" Rose says. \"Like I said, we'll go over the details when we arrive at my house. Come on, let's go get Flower.\"<br/><br/>",

She'd already finished replacing the chain on Arraka's amulet, and she was also surprised that we didn't wait for her at our designated meeting spot, but she agreed to postpone her questions until after we'd reached Rose's house. <br/>We took a somewhat roundabout way this time around, in order to make sure that nobody who saw the earlier scene was following us. As we advanced into the city, the scenery began to slowly change, and instead of broken down shacks, we started seeing more elegant houses, and even a few mansions. The putrid smell on the streets was also long gone by the time we'd finally reached Rose's house. To our surprise, despite her previous claims of living in relative poverty, Rose's house was in fact a very large mansion, with two floors and a yard the size of a small park. <br/><br/>\"Kate, you can stop suppressing your magical aura now,\" Rose says, as we walk across her yard. \"My siblings don't know what a banshee is, so there's no need to hide from them!\"<br/><br/> \"Rose, I don't mean to sound rude,\" Hadrik says, \"but didn't you tell me that you and your two siblings were living a modest life here in the city?\" <br/>Rose blushes.<br/><br/>\"I am not the one who bought this house,\" Rose says. \"This is where I used to live with my old husband, before we got divorced. He told me that he didn't mind me keeping this house for myself, since he owned many other mansions in better areas of the city. I meant to refuse him at first, but I had both my siblings and my sickly father to care for at the time and it would have been very hard for me to continue living with them in our old cramped house.\"<br/><br/>\"Ah, he was trying to win you back with a little parting gift, was he?\" Hadrik asks, with a grin.<br/><br/>",

After we got divorced, he told me that during our marriage, he felt like a caged bird that was denied the freedom to soar the skies, in search of stars that shined brightly in the night. He also told me that no matter how many stars he'd end up visiting, I would always remain the sun that outshines them all, and that he'd never love another woman with as much passion as he'd loved me.\"<br/>Rose giggles.<br/><br/>\"It was always hard to take him seriously when he said things like that,\" she says, smiling.<br/><br/>\"Look, it's Rose!\" I hear a young girl shout from a distance, as she comes running towards us. \"Rose is back! Come quick!\"<br/><br/>The girl, who appears to be Rose's eight year old sister, is now waving towards her nine year old brother, and they both race across the yard, until they finally reach us.<br/><br/> \"Rose, look!\" the girl says, with a proud tone in her voice, as she takes something out of her pocket and shows it to her. \"Billy's already fourteen years old! And he's just as lively as ever!

She said she'd most likely come back by sundown, and that she'd leave the house in our care until then. Since none of us were really in the mood for hanging out after all that's happened, we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon in our rooms, until Rose came back.<br/><br/>Once she returned, we all got together at one of the picnic tables in the yard, and Hadrik joined us too, after he cooled down a bit. Daren, however, hasn't gotten out of his room at all since we arrived at the mansion.<br/><br/>",

Are you saying that going against this continent's royalty would have been more risky than fighting a fort full of ogres? Is that what you're telling me?!\"<br/><br/>\"Hadrik,\" Kate says. \"We can't save everyone...\"<br/><br/>\"That doesn't mean that we have to ignore what happens right in front of our faces!\" Hadrik says, as he slams both his fists on the table in front of him. \"I can't believe you two! I barely feel like I know you anymore! It's like you've both turned into Arraka!\"<br/><br/>\"And what's so bad about that?\" Arraka asks, as Hadrik grabs his backpack, gets up from the table and storms through the yard, all the way to the mansion's entrance.<br/><br/>\"Can you believe this guy?\" Arraka asks us. \"One moment he's all about fighting and drinking, and then all of a sudden he starts acting like the healer! What's the big deal about some slave girl dying anyway?\"<br/><br/>\"Shut up, Arraka,\" Flower says.<br/><br/>\"What?\" Arraka says. \"That girl was totally asking for it. She was trying to slack off on the job, and on top of that she even gave her owner lip when he told her to get back to work. I would have killed her too if she were my slave and she acted with me like that. Hell, I would have probably killed her anyway just for laughs!\"<br/><br/>\"Arraka, do you want to spend the next twenty years with your amulet closed again?\" Flower says. <br/><br/> This time, the girl managed to shut her up. It doesn't seem like Arraka is very keen on returning to her old way of life anytime soon.<br/>\"Did... something happen to Hadrik?\" Rose says, as she approaches us. \"He asked me to give him the directions to his room when we met in the hallway, and after I gave them to him, he just stormed right past me, without saying another word. He looked pretty upset about something.\"<br/> <br/>\"He got really angry when we told him what happened to the slave girl earlier,\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"Oh...\" Rose says. \"I see...\"<br/><br/>\"Could you lead us to our rooms too?\" I say, trying to change the subject. \"I could really go for a nap in an actual bed right now.\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" Rose says. \"Follow me.\"<br/><br/>After showing us all to our rooms, Rose told us that she now needed to go visit the Sparrow's district, in order to bring all of her collected herbs to the sick. She said she'd most likely come back by sundown, and that she'd leave the house in our care until then. Since none of us were really in the mood for hanging out after all that's happened, we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon in our rooms, until Rose came back.<br/><br/>Once she returned, we all got together at one of the picnic tables in the yard, and Hadrik joined us too, after he cooled down a bit. Daren, however, hasn't gotten out of his room at all since we arrived at the mansion.<br/><br/>",

Hurry up or we'll leave you behind. I'm serious.\" <br/><br/>As Daren leaves, I take a look outside my window, and I see that the sun had only just risen about an hour ago. Everyone was already waiting outside, while Rose's siblings were running around the yard, as lively as ever. <br/><br/>I jump out of bed and get dressed, but I don't take my backpack with me. Daren probably only meant that we were going downtown to get some supplies. I take some money with me, and my dagger, just in case, and then I head downstairs. <br/><br/>\"Where are we going?\" I ask Rose, as I approach everyone who was waiting in the yard.<br/><br/> \"We're going to a hospital from the Beggar's district,\" Rose says. \"I went there yesterday, after visiting the Sparrow's district, and I saw a lot of wounded who weren't being treated properly due to a severe lack of qualified personnel.

At first, I only wanted to bring Daren, but Hadrik insisted that we all go.\"<br/>\"It's safer if we all stick together,\" Hadrik says. \"Just because we're in a city, it doesn't mean that we can let our guards down. We're still in the middle of a deadly tournament, after all.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay, if everyone's ready, we should get going,\" Rose says. \"We'll be taking the shorter route this time, so be sure to stay close to me so you don't get lost.\"<br/><br/>",

At the Beacon, every now and then, a member of the staff or a complete stranger would start acting very nice and considerate with one of the orphans, out of the blue. After some time, when they were sure that they'd gained their trust, they'd suddenly say that they wanted to help them escape. If the orphan believed them, and followed their instructions, they would be recaptured by the very person that tried to help them, and told that it was all a test of loyalty that they had failed. Then they would either be beaten senseless for breaking the rules, or they'd be killed to serve as an example for all the other orphans. This way, if anyone ever actually tried to help one of us, we'd never believe them, and we'd choose to remain prisoners, out of fear.\"<br/>Rose gasps.<br/><br/>\"My gods, that's horrible,\" she says. \"But if what you say is true, then how are we going to convince Ella that we're telling the truth?\"<br/><br/>\"We're not going to convince her,\" Kate says. \"Even after hearing us discuss things openly in front of her like this, she still probably thinks it's all just part of an elaborate act, in order to make her lower her guard.

She said she'd most likely come back by sundown, and that she'd leave the house in our care until then. As we all wave goodbye to Rose, Suzie suddenly comes out the front door, pulling Ella by the hand, while rushing towards us.<br/><br/> If I did not know that Ella left with Suzie a little while ago, it would have taken me a minute to figure out whose hand the little girl was holding. The former slave girl was nearly unrecognizable, as she was now wearing an elegant green dress, while her hair had been cleaned up, and meticulously braided. She looked stunning. I guess this explains what the two of them have been doing for the past two hours.<br/>\"Ta-daaaa!\" Suzie says, with a very proud look on her face.<br/><br/>\"Wow,\" Hadrik says. \"That's uh... quite the change. Are you the one who braided her hair, Suzie?\"<br/><br/>\"Yep!\" the little girl says, beaming. \"Isn't she beautiful? Come on, Ella, don't be shy, and turn around so everyone can see!\"<br/><br/>Ella seems to be very flustered about all of this, and her cheeks could not be any more red. She probably isn't used to getting this much attention. She turns around, just as ordered, so we could all have a look at her braided hair. Looking at it closely, you could clearly see that there's been a lot of work put into it. The girl must have been at it for at least the better part of an hour.<br/><br/>\"Come on, Ella!\" Suzie says, as she grabs her hand, and she pulls her back towards the mansion. \"Let's play!\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " Hadrik, Kate, Flower and I spent the rest of the day at one of the picnic tables, chatting and eating some more of Flower's magically conceived delicacies. Daren did not come out of the mansion at all during the day, so he must have spent most of the time in his room. As we all sat down at the table, every once in a while, we'd catch a glimpse of Suzie and Ella, running around the yard, or playing hide and seek. As the sun was starting to set, it was becoming clear that Ella was making a great effort to keep up with the little girl's demands, as she got more and more tired.<br/>\"Faster!\" Suzie says, as Ella runs around the yard, giving her a piggyback ride. \"You can do it, Ella! Faster!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, Suzie,\" Rose's little brother says, as he watches Ella run circles around the yard. \"Ella will do anything you say, right?\"<br/><br/>\"Yep!\" the girl says.<br/><br/>\"Tell her to stand on her hands!\" the boy says.<br/><br/>\"What?\" Suzie ask, shocked. \"No! Why would I tell her to do that?\"<br/><br/>\"Because it'd be fun to watch!\" the boy says.<br/><br/>\"I won't tell her to stand on her hands, Kevin!\"<br/><br/>\"Why not? She'll do everything you tell her to do, so where's the problem?\"<br/><br/>\"That doesn't mean we have to make fun of her!\" Suzie says, visibly upset.<br/><br/> \"Pffft!\" Kevin says. \"You're no fun.\"<br/>\"No, you're no fun!\" Suzie says. \"You're just a mean meanie head, and that's why you don't have any friends!\"<br/><br/>Suzie gets down from Ella's back and she hugs her tightly, while giving her brother a menacing look.<br/><br/>\"Don't worry, Ella,\" the little girl says. \"I would never do anything to hurt you!\"<br/><br/>Ella now looks like she's barely able to stand on her feet.<br/><br/>\"Thank you... miss...\" she says, with the last of her strength, and then she faints, due to exhaustion.<br/><br/>\"Ella!\" Suzie screams.<br/><br/>When we see what happened, Hadrik and I both rush simultaneously towards Ella, and the first thing we do is to make sure that she is still alive. The girl is still breathing, but she has a very high fever. <br/><br/>\"I did this!\" Suzie says, as tears start streaming down her face. \"I killed her! I shouldn't have asked her for that piggyback ride! I should have seen that she was too tired! Now she's going to die and it's all my fault!\"<br/><br/>After she finishes her last sentence, the girl breaks down into uncontrollable crying, and she buries her head in her arms.<br/><br/>",

Rose grabs the girl's hand between her palms, she looks her in the eyes, and she gives her a warm smile.<br/><br/>\"But you are not a slave anymore,\" Rose says. \"You have no longer been a slave ever since Barry saved you from that noble, today.

You can go wherever you want, and do whatever you want for as long as you want. You don't have to listen to anyone's orders ever again, and you can make your own choices without living in fear.\"<br/><br/>Rose pauses.<br/><br/> \"But if you'll allow me to make a selfish request...\" Rose says. \"I would be very grateful if you chose to remain here.

Ella, would it be too much to ask of you to keep working for us for a while longer?\"<br/>\"No!\" Ella says, as she looks like she's about to cry. \"Of course not! I would love to keep working here! My time spent here has been the happiest of my life! I don't want to leave!

Since it was getting close to bedtime, we each started heading towards our own rooms and said we'd meet up again in the morning, to plan what we wanted to do next. <br/><br/> Before going to bed, I took a nice long bath in one of the many bathrooms available in the mansion. It was nice to bathe in hot water, for a change, after all of those days of washing in cold lakes and rivers. As I entered my room, my stat device started beeping loudly. It's been a while since I've gotten any new points to spend on my stats. I need to be extra careful with what I choose to upgrade this time, because at this rate, who knows when I'll be getting my next batch of points.<br/>I take the device out of my pocket and start thinking how to make the best use of these points.<br/><br/>",

The same place where I spent my time fighting dragons, dodging traps and stealing treasure from ogres?

I promise you that neither of us is going to regret this!\"<br/><br/>She then presses her lips against mine once more, as she starts to slowly unbutton my shirt. The next two hours seemed like they were almost a dream. Was I really still in the same place where I've been desperately fighting for my life for almost a week? The same place where I spent my time fighting dragons, dodging traps and stealing treasure from ogres? Actually, now that I pause to think about it, last week is starting to sound a lot more like a dream than what happened tonight. Maybe it really was a dream. I mean, seriously... Dragons?

She looks like she's in some kind of a stasis, much like the one I put her in when we were at the ogre fort.\"<br/><br/>As Daren tries to wake Rose up, the two mages that were coming our way finally make their appearance. One of them is dressed in black robes and has a snake tattoo on his bald head, while the other one is wearing green robes and a silver circlet on his head. I immediately recognize them as being the two followers of the God of Death and the God of Fate that tried to kill us with the stillwater skeletons on the day that we met Hadrik.<br/><br/>\"So much for your stupid trap, Zack,\" the mage in the green robes says. \"We paid all of that money and all we managed to do is knock out the one member of their team who can't even put up a fight.\"<br/><br/>\"Silence, fool,\" Zack says. \"The merchant warned us that the trap had a low chance of success against trained mages. And we didn't just get one of them, we got two. If you look closely, you can see that the little girl is actually a fusion of two souls. We managed to put the host in a dormant state, while the banshee is still keeping control of the body.\"<br/><br/>\"You!\" Daren shouts at the two mages. \"How are you still here after hurting Rose? Why didn't the tournament's spell send you back?\"<br/><br/> \"I would ask you the same thing, healer in armor,\" says the mage in green robes. \"Didn't you or one of your friends kill a local yesterday? That is what it says on this poster, after all.\"<br/>He takes a rolled up poster out of his sleeve, and he unfurls it in front of us, so we can all see its contents. On the piece of paper, we see some poorly drawn sketches of me, Daren, Kate and Eiden along with a title that says: 'Wanted - Dead or Alive - Daren, the healer in armor, and his accomplices, for the murder of the earl of Ollendor'. The reward on our heads is in a local currency that I am unfamiliar with, but I'm guessing that they're probably offering a lot of money, given the circumstances.<br/><br/>\"We just happened to see this poster yesterday while we were looking for a few bounties to kill some time,\" the mage in the green robes says, \"and we quickly agreed that it was no mere coincidence, but the hand of fate that was guiding our actions.\"<br/><br/>\"It wasn't fate,\" Zack says, \"it was the God of Death himself who was giving us another chance to make up for our miserable failure from last week. This time we'll make sure to send you all to your graves, in the name of my god.\"<br/><br/>",
