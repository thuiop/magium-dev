"Alright, I think that's a wrap!" says Daren once we finish our strategy meeting. 

We're currently all sitting in a circle in front of our cave's entrance. The sun is pretty high up in the sky, and there's not a cloud in sight. Luckily, Kate has graciously agreed to use her ice magic to cool the air around us a bit. This way we can enjoy the weather without feeling as if we were inside an oven. 

"Noon is almost upon us," Daren continues. "We should get going as soon as possible. We can't afford to keep travelling once the sun sets, and we have a long road ahead of us. Rose, did you get all of the herbs you were looking for?"

"Oh, no... I just remembered, I dropped my bag of herbs when I was being chased by the goblins."

"Don't worry, I doubt anyone would have stolen it, so it must still be where you left it. I'll help you look for it! Come with me."

I get up to follow them, but Kate grabs me by the sleeve.

"Wait," she says. "There's something that's been bothering me since this morning."
She looks really tense. It seems that she's struggling to get the words out of her mouth.

"Were you..."

She pauses.

"Were you really smitten with me since you first saw me?"

Of all the things I would have expected her to say to me right now, this was the last of them. Thanks a lot, Daren. What am I supposed to tell her, now?

"Maybe a little," I tell her.
"You were?! I thought he was just joking! I'm... sorry, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but I'm not... interested right now."

"I said only a little. What's gotten into you all of a sudden? This isn't like you."

Kate looks away, takes a deep breath and exhales before she continues.

"When those three mages attacked us earlier, it made me realize something. You and Rose are the only persons I've ever met that did not treat me like some kind of monster. Even if people don't always say it openly like those three mages did, there's something in their eyes that gives them away. Something that makes it clear that they do not see me as human. It's the same with Daren. Despite what you've said, I don't think he truly believes I'm not a banshee. I think it's only a matter of time before I'll have to fight him, just like I've had to fight everyone else."

I guess she's starting to see through my lie already. I was hoping I could convince her to not lose her trust in Daren, but it seems she never really had much trust in him to begin with.

Kate shifts her gaze back to me.
"But you and Rose... you're different. When I talk to you, I see neither fear nor apprehension in your eyes. You speak to me as normally as you would speak with any other person. I do not know why that is. I do not know what's wrong with you, but... thank you... for making me feel part of a group for the first time in my life."

"Hey, there you are!" Daren shouts from a distance, as he and Rose come back from the forest. "We found Rose's bag not far from here. It's still got all her herbs inside. We should be good to go."

When he gets closer, he looks at me and Kate and says:

"I'm sorry, did we interrupt something?"

Kate makes a long sword of ice materialize in her hand and she presses its tip lightly against my throat.

"Say that again. I dare you."

"See, now you're acting more like yourself! All jokes aside, I think Daren has a point. The sooner we leave here, the better. Let's get going."

Kate takes her sword out of my face and makes it vanish, while Daren and I head for the cave to make sure we're not forgetting anything.

Before leaving, I make sure to take with me my spoils of war from this morning's skirmishes: a crossbow from one of the crossbowmen who ambushed us and a few daggers from Cutthroat Dave's men.
We join back with Rose, and we set off on our long road ahead. 

Shortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.

"Barry, why aren't you just putting that crossbow inside the backpack, like you did with everything else?"

"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff."

"Full? Wait a minute, Barry, you're telling me that the backpack you are carrying with you right now is actually a completely regular one?"

"Well, yeah, enchanted backpacks are really hard to come by if you're not a mage."

"You realize you could have asked me to enchant it for you, right? It literally only takes a few minutes. Here, give me that."
Daren grabs my backpack and enters an enchanting trance. His eyes become yellow and the backpack starts to glow. The fact that Daren specializes on item enchanting had completely slipped my mind. Enchanted backpacks are leagues better than normal ones. They have almost infinite space, and people can't see what's inside them, so they can only steal your stuff if they know exactly what they're looking for. Taking an item out of an enchanted backpack is as simple as focusing on its image, and reaching inside for it.

Rose is looking very interested in the enchanting process. She is now studying Daren closely.

"Hey, Barry," Daren says. "Do you want to have your backpack extra secure or should I just leave it like this? If I secure it, then only you will be able to take items out of it. The only downside is that you can't really authorize other persons to take items from your backpack once you secure it. Normally, security shouldn't be much of a problem with these backpacks because someone has to actually know what you have inside before taking an item, but it never hurts to be safe."

Just as we reach the cave's entrance, we see Molan, the deer fawn, jumping up and down, looking very excited.
"Mommy, mommy, come quick! It's aunt Rose! Aunt Rose came to visit us!"

Rose's usual warm smile perished from her face when she saw the deer fawn and was replaced by a sad expression in her eyes. 

"Rose?" says Elaria as she exits the cave. "Rose, is that you?"

"Yes..." Rose answers in the deer's language, not bringing herself to look her in the eyes. "It's been a while."

"It has. We haven't seen you in months. And you used to visit us so often. Rose, you know you'll always be welcome in our home, right?"

"I know... I'm sorry, I have to go now."

"Aunt Rose, you're not staying?" the deer fawn asks her.

"Don't worry, little one," Elaria tells her son. "I'm sure she'll come back and stay longer when she'll be ready. She must have something important to do. You know how she is, always busy helping people."

"Thank you... and I'm sorry," Rose says, as she bows, and then turns away from the deer.
"Here are your things," Elaria says, as she shows us our backpacks. "I took the liberty of making some more food for you, in case you get hungry and want to eat something other than roots and berries."

"Thank you for all your help," I tell her. "I hope we meet again!"

"It's a small continent. I'm sure our paths will cross again someday."

Kate and I say our goodbyes to the two deer, and we go on our way.

"Oh, I met Elaria and Molan a few years ago when I was out collecting herbs. Molan was very sick and I helped make an ointment to cure his illness. We've been friends ever since."

"And then something happened?"

Rose's smile remained on her face, but her eyes started to show a bit of sadness.

"It was that obvious, huh? Yes, something happened, although it wasn't something that Elaria or I did. A few months ago, after the death of our grand priest, people started to get desperate. Our last reserves of food were dwindling and it wasn't long before only the rich had access to any kind of conjured food that remained. Animal hunting became more and more popular, and a war between the animals and the humans was inevitable. The war has cost us many lives, including Molan's father.

The only downside is that you can't really authorize other persons to take items from your backpack once you secure it. Normally, security shouldn't be much of a problem with these backpacks because someone has to actually know what you have inside before taking an item, but it never hurts to be safe."

Once he's done enchanting my backpack, he hands it back to me and then turns to Rose.

"I can see you're very interested in my craft. Would you perhaps like to have your backpack enchanted as well?"

Rose blushes, realizing she'd been a bit too obvious in her curiosity.

"I would be honored!" she answers.

Once he's done with her backpack too, we continue on our way.

We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town. Her usual route was designed to avoid most areas that are known to be frequented by monsters, but Daren insisted on delivering the cure to the sick as soon as possible, and said that our group should be more than able to handle a few monster attacks.

The scenery that we've seen during our travel has been rather underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I always thought that the fabled continent of Varathia would be filled with all sorts of natural wonders and mythical creatures. All I've seen today were your everyday pine and oak forests, with a lake or a river here and there to keep it from becoming completely monotonous. At least it's been a few hours since the last time we've been attacked, which is quite an achievement, judging by how this tournament has been going so far.

Kate seems to have somewhat recovered since this morning, but she still looks weak, and she almost lost her balance a few times while we were walking. When Rose asked her if she'd rather we take a break, she said that she'll be fine and that we should keep going without worrying about her.

Once he's done with her backpack too, Daren turns to me, with a very excited look on his face.

"Barry, I just realized something. Remember how I said that we'd have to travel all the way to a city in order to find a local you could attack so that you'd get sent home? Well, we don't need to do that anymore! Now we've got Rose."

I hadn't thought of that. How did I not think of that? I should have known this would happen the moment we'd met her.

"No, I couldn't. Even if it means getting back home, I can't just attack Rose like that." 

"You don't need to worry about that," Rose says, smiling. "I'd be glad to help! And besides, we already know the spell would stop you before actually touching me thanks to that mage that attacked me this morning."

I realize I'm sweating. Kate is watching me intently.
"But, uh... what about escorting Rose home?"

"What about it?" Daren asks. "Me and Kate should be more than enough to deal with a few monsters."

"Yes but, I..."

Words fail me. I can't think up an excuse fast enough.

"I don't..."

As I struggle to find my words, Daren finally starts to understand what's going on. His expression is getting darker, and more serious.

"Barry, you didn't really come here against your will, did you?"

"No... No I didn't."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"I... joined for the same reason as everyone else. I'm after the Magium. It's been my dream to become a mage for as long as I can remember."

"When were you planning on telling me this?"

"Barry, I just realized something. Rose is a herbalist! She can help you find the plants you need to cure your sister! I bet she knows this continent in and out when it comes to medicinal herbs."

"Uh, I don't think--"

"Barry, your sister is ill?" Rose asks me, concerned. "I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of herbs are you looking for, exactly?"

"I'm, uh... looking for a kind of plant that has long leaves with crenate margins, and little purple fruit with white spots."

"I know of the plants you're talking about but... those aren't medicinal herbs. They're used to make a kind of tea. Are you sure you aren't mistaken?"

I realize I'm sweating. Kate is watching me intently.
"Oh, now that you mention it, I think the fruits were blue with white spots, not purple."

"I'm pretty sure that plants with blue spotted fruits cannot have long leaves. What kind of medicine do you need these plants for? Maybe I can help you make it."

"It's, uh.. a medicine for, uh..."

Words fail me. I can't think up a name fast enough.

"No, it's--"

"I've heard enough. Let's keep moving. We shouldn't be wasting any more time."

He then walks past me, and does not say another word.

"Oh no, did I say something I shouldn't have?" Rose asks Kate.

"No, this is entirely Barry's fault. Don't worry about it."

We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town. Her usual route was designed to avoid most areas that are known to be frequented by monsters, but Daren insisted on delivering the cure to the sick as soon as possible, and said that our group should be more than able to handle a few monster attacks.

The scenery that we've seen during our travel has been rather underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I always thought that the fabled continent of Varathia would be filled with all sorts of natural wonders and mythical creatures. All I've seen today were your everyday pine and oak forests, with a lake or a river here and there to keep it from becoming completely monotonous. At least it's been a few hours since the last time we've been attacked, which is quite an achievement, judging by how this tournament has been going so far.

Kate seems to have somewhat recovered since this morning, but she still looks weak, and she almost lost her balance a few times while we were walking. When Rose asked her if she'd rather we take a break, she said that she'll be fine and that we should keep going without worrying about her.

Kate has opened up a bit since her last discussion with me. When we first met yesterday, she looked very tense, and it seemed as though she was expecting us to try and kill her the moment she turns her back on us. Now she seems calmer, and she allows herself to smile a little more often, even if only faintly, especially when she's talking with Rose. 
We've been keeping a steady pace so far, and there's been no breaks except for occasionally stopping to get some fruits from the trees, or to fill our gourds with water from a river. During one of these small breaks, Rose approached me in private to ask me about the discussion I had with Kate this morning.

"Barry, I've been meaning to ask, did we actually interrupt an important discussion between you and Kate this morning? Kate's been acting evasive every time I brought up the subject. I'd feel terrible if you two lost the chance to confess your feelings for each other because Daren and I couldn't read the mood."

I can only hope that he won't be like this for the rest of our trip. Rose tried several times to get the two of us to talk to each other, but the most that she managed to get out of Daren were short and concise answers to her questions, nothing more.

Rose and I join the others, and once we're all done gathering provisions, we depart once more. As we travel, we start talking about various things: Daren's adventures, our lives before joining the tournament, the reasons we all came here. During our conversations, Daren was of course the one that's been speaking the most, while Kate has been as evasive as always about her past and her reasons for being here. Hearing our stories, Rose decides to join our discussion, by telling us a bit about herself.
"I've always liked plants," she tells us. "Plants and books. So it's no surprise that I spent most of my youth with my nose buried in herbology manuals. As time passed, I started to learn more about herbal medicine, and I realized my talents could be used to help the people in need. Most people I help don't really have much money to repay me, but the little they give me is enough for me to make a living, and their sincere feelings of gratitude are much more rewarding to me than the money I'd get by only working for rich folk. I've been living a modest life along with my brother and sister who are nine and eight years old respectively, and ever since my father died last year, I've been occasionally getting some financial support from my ex husband."

"You were married?" Daren asks.

"Yes, for a few years, but it didn't really work out in the end. We've both moved on with our lives since then, and we've had no children together, so there were no hard feelings. Ever since my father died, I've had to take care of my siblings all by myself, so my main focus for the past year has been my work, and my family."

"But what about your mother?" says Kate.

"She died long ago, when she gave birth to my little sister."
"Oh... I'm sorry."

Rose smiles.

"There's no need, you couldn't have known."

"So, how did you all handle the death of your grand priest?" Daren asks, trying to change the subject. "You said that he was the last person alive that could create food out of nothing in your city, so I imagine there must have been some backup plan in case of his inevitable death?"

"Oh, yes, many people have started to learn agriculture, but the problem is that most of the fertile terrain around our town is already owned by the nobles. By planting your seeds further away from the town, you run a great risk of getting your crops raided by monsters."

"Are monster raids frequent in your area?"
"Yes, monsters have been getting bolder in the past few decades. It's not just in our area, it happens throughout the entire continent. I'm not certain, but I think it all started when we lost contact with the animal kingdom. After the first animal hunts were started by the people of Olmnar several decades ago, the animals' leader, the spirit golden fox has ordered her subjects to stop speaking in our language. The monsters must have found out about this, and they took advantage of the fact that the humans and the animals were no longer working together in order to wreak havoc."

"What about the gods?" Daren asks. "Are they not getting involved in any of this?"

"The only gods that are currently getting involved are the god of Fate and the god of Death, but I very much doubt that any of them have our best interests at heart. It is said that the two of them started working together recently, and that might well be true, judging by the high level of cooperation between their followers lately."

"Wait, isn't the god of Fate just a fancy title for the god of Illusions?" Daren says.

"Yes," Rose answers. "Most gods name themselves after the power their followers gain by worshipping them. Some of them, however choose other names for themselves, which can be a bit confusing. It's the same for the god of Death. Judging by his name, you would think that he reigns over the underworld, but in fact he is just a god of Necromancy, bringing the dead back to life to serve his bidding."

"Why aren't the people rebelling against the nobles?"
"Some of them are, but the nobles are backed up by royalty, so most people don't dare to openly oppose them. In our town, the rebels are almost inexistent, but I hear that in some cities with a similar situation to ours there are full-blown civil wars going."

As Rose talks, I hear three loud beeps coming from my pocket. I pull out my stat device, and am surprised to see that the maximum numbers for my stats have now been increased to four.
"What's that?" Rose asks.

"It's a toy," Daren says before I get a chance to reply. "You know those magical devices that simulate a pet in order to teach little kids about responsibilities? Those beeps you heard were Barry's pet getting hungry."

"Oh, I love those toys! Ever since I got one for my little sister I just couldn't keep her apart from it!"

"Ignore Daren," Kate says. "He was just being a smartass. What Barry has there is a stat booster. He's using it to harness magical energy from the air which he can then use to augment his physical abilities."

Rose looks impressed.

"Wow, I did not know such a thing was possible. So that device is basically turning you into a mage?"

I never thought about it this way. It's true that there are some mages that actually use their magic to augment their powers, in a similar way that this device does. Does that make me one of them?
"I suppose..." I answer her. "But it's only temporary. The device will run out of energy once I'm no longer surrounded by all these powerful mages to extract it from."

I take a look at my stat booster and start to think of what I should spend my newly acquired points on.

As I finish using my device, Rose asks me another question.
"Wait, so if your stat booster extracts magical energy from other mages, does that mean it's also eating away at Daren and Kate's powers?"

"It's getting a bit of energy from every mage in a thirty mile radius, but the amount it takes from each of them is barely enough to mildly inconvenience them. Most of the energy it's getting is from the powerful spells that have been cast all around us since the beginning of this tournament, and that energy would have just dissipated into thin air anyway, so you could just say I'm recycling it, rather than stealing it. I think that--"

I get interrupted by a very loud roar that echoes all around us. 

"What was that?" Rose asks, visibly scared.

A second, louder roar now booms through the air, as I can feel my hair stand up on the back of my neck. I've never heard this sound before in my life. I have no idea what beast might be causing it. So then what is this feeling of dread I'm getting all of a sudden? Why do I find myself wanting to run as fast as I can, in any direction, as long as it gets me as far away from this place as possible?

Shortly after the second roar ended, a very powerful wind started to blow towards us. I can almost feel it trying to lift me in the air. The trees are barely holding up, and it looks as if they could get pulled out of their roots at any moment. We're lucky that this happened while we were in a clearing, because otherwise we would have had to also protect ourselves from falling trees, while trying to hold our ground against the relentless force of the wind.
As some of the trees start to fall, a monstrous figure makes its appearance high above us. It's at least fifty foot tall, with very tough looking red scales covering its entire body, and wings the size of sails on a longship. Its claws look as sharp as blades, and its fangs are bared at us menacingly, but its overall appearance is not much different from that of an overgrown lizard. 

A dragon. They really existed. Is this all happening because of my disappointment for not encountering any mythical creatures so far? If that's the case, then I take it back. I take it all back, just, please, let this all be a dream. Let this all just be the end of a bad dream, before I wake up back in our cave, and then we can start our journey anew. 

"Get down!!!" Daren shouts to us, as the dragon gets closer, and then lands a few dozen feet in front of us, making the whole ground tremble violently under its weight. 

"No..." Rose says, unable to control her shivering, and barely able to keep her balance anymore. "This can't be happening. This can't be happening..."

 The dragon looks all around us, as if it were trying to find something, and then it shouts loudly, in the common tongue:
"Where is he?!"

Seeing that none of us are answering, the dragon asks us again, this time giving us a few more details.

"The stillwater! Where is he?! You reek of his stench. Where are you hiding him?"

"We don't know where he went, he didn't tell us."

"Then you are useless to me."

The dragon growls before it continues.

"I should have known that I'd be wasting my time by trying to communicate with the likes of you. If only that stillwater would have minded his own business after he returned to the continent instead of writing that accursed message in the sky, I'd have left him be. But he had the incredible nerve to involve the dragon hunters in all of this?"

"Wait, we're not dragon hunters. Please, if you could just let us explain--"

"Silence, mongrel! I've watched your pathetic human race fumble their way through life ever since they stopped walking on four legs. I could have killed or enslaved you all at any point in your miserable existence, if it weren't beneath me. But now your kind dares to rise against me? Your charred remains will serve as my gift for Eiden, to welcome him back to my realm."

The dragon soars to the sky, as it shouts its final words to us.

"Pray to your gods, humans! They're the only ones that can save you from the onslaught that will follow."

"Quick, everyone get behind me!" Daren shouts, as he raises his shield, and a semi-transparent magical barrier starts to form around us.
Kate doubles up our protection by also making a dome of thick ice to surround us. The dragon, who has now raised himself to a sufficiently high altitude unleashes a downpour of flames upon us. As the flames collide with our protections, we start to feel the air heating up all around us. Kate's ice has already melted away, and all that's standing between us and the torrent of fire is Daren's magical barrier.

Rose is now sitting on the ground, with a terrified look in her eyes, hugging her legs and shaking violently.

"Rose!" Kate yells at her. "Snap out of it! We'll need to be ready to get out of here as soon as Daren's barrier breaks. Do you hear me?!"

The dragon's flames have suddenly stopped. Looking up to see what happened, I am terrified to learn that the monster is now quickly diving towards us. Kate tries to make another wall of ice between us and the dragon, but it breaks through it in a second, and then clashes with Daren's magical barrier, shattering it in an instant. The dragon then grabs Daren in one of its claws, and soars back up into the sky. We can hear Daren's screams as the giant lizard tries to crush him.

Kate launches several hundred sharp ice blades towards the dragon, but they simply bounce off its armored scales. 
"Kate!" Daren shouts from the distance. "Can you-- NGHHH--- Can you make a slide for me?"

"Yes," Kate shouts back, as she quickly builds an ice slide that starts below him and ends on the ground next to us. Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. 

Just as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover. As the flames and the ice clash, I can see that Kate is making a great effort to keep the fire back. 

Daren quickly rushes to her position and provides her with cover before her ice melts away. Unfortunately, the fight has weakened him as well, and he does not manage to hold the barrier for long. His barrier breaks, and his shield drops to the ground, right when the dragon finishes its attack. The explosion of air generated by the destruction of Daren's barrier sent Rose flying, and she hit her head on a rock. She is now lying on the ground, motionless.

Think, Barry. Think. What can you do to turn the tide? There has to be something. There has to be a way to use everything you know to your advantage. There has to be a way. Think!

"It's over, humans," the dragon shouts triumphantly from high above. "Your era is at an end. I am going to exterminate every single one of you, until all that remains of your race is a forgotten memory. And I'm saving Eiden for last."
It's no use. My stat device is worthless here. Even if I had all of my stats maxed out I wouldn't stand a chance. This was all over before it began.

As the dragon's flames pour down on us, I close my eyes, awaiting for my impending doom. After a few seconds of keeping my eyes closed, I realize that I'm still alive. I open my eyes back up and find out to my surprise that the dragon's flames have stopped in mid-air, a few inches before reaching us, as if they were frozen. But that is not all. Looking around me, I see that everything else is frozen too. Daren, Kate and Rose are all standing completely still, and I can't even feel the wind anymore. 

"Seriously, now," I hear a familiar voice behind me. "How could I have let him win after saying a line like that?"

I quickly turn around and see Eiden standing behind me, with his eyes closed as usual and a smile on his face.

"I mean, I don't think I've even read a children's book where the main villain gloats to such an extent. It's embarrassing, really."

Kate launches several hundred sharp ice blades towards the dragon, but they simply bounce off its armored scales. 
"Kate!" Daren shouts from the distance. "Can you-- NGHHH--- Can you make a slide for me?"

"Yes," Kate shouts back, as she quickly builds an ice slide that starts below him and ends on the ground next to us. Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. 

Casting so many spells one after the other has taken its toll on Kate, who still hadn't recovered fully after this morning's skirmish with the crossbowmen. She is breathing heavily, and her right hand is trembling.

Just as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover.

As the flames and the ice clash, I can see Kate struggling to keep her shield intact, but it is too much for her, in her current state. The shield melts, and the flames engulf her entire left arm and half of her face. She starts to scream from the pain, but quickly stops herself, and uses ice to put out the fire. The flames have left a hideous red mark covering the whole left side of her face, but her resolve has not wavered. She looks more determined than ever.

She readies a new ice shield and prepares to block the dragon's next breath attack. 

Daren quickly rushes to her position and provides her with cover before her ice melts away. Unfortunately, the fight has weakened him as well, and he does not manage to hold the barrier for long. His barrier breaks, and his shield drops to the ground, right when the dragon finishes its attack. The explosion of air generated by the destruction of Daren's barrier sent Rose flying, and she hit her head on a rock. She is now lying on the ground, motionless.
Think, Barry. Think. What can you do to turn the tide? There has to be something. There has to be a way to use everything you know to your advantage. There has to be a way. Think!!!

"It's over, humans," the dragon shouts triumphantly from high above. "Your era is at an end. I am going to exterminate every single one of you, until all that remains of your race is a forgotten memory. And I'm saving Eiden for last."

It's no use. My stat device is worthless here. Even if I had all of my stats maxed out I wouldn't stand a chance. This was all over before it began.

Eiden snaps his fingers and my stat device flies out of my hand and into his. The device then suddenly starts glowing and it looks like it's accumulating a massive amount of energy in a very short amount of time.

"Hey!!!"

"I realize this must all be very confusing for you, Barry, so I'm going to provide you with a little bit of context. The beast that just attacked you is Tyrath, the self proclaimed king of all dragons. The reason he's looking for me is because I wrote a message in the stars last night in an ancient language used primarily by dragon hunters. The message's purpose was to let all dragon hunters who entered this contest know that a dragon exists on this island, and to give them all a little extra incentive to hunt him down. I very much doubt that any of them will pose a realistic threat to him, but it will be fun to watch."

He finishes charging up my stat device and then hands it back to me. As I hold it in my hand, I can feel a powerful surge of magical energy run through me and flow through all of my body. 

"I believe your ultimate goal was to win this tournament and become a mage, was it not? Well, Barry, I am now giving you a taste of that power. For about five minutes, you will have magical powers comparable to mine. More than enough to drive off the dragon, I'd wager. All of the information you need in order to use your powers should have been transferred into your mind by the stat device. I'm looking forward to watching your battle!"
Eiden then starts to fade into thin air. When only his outline is visible anymore, he says:

"I could tell you, but, wouldn't you rather find out by yourself? Would you not rather live the thrill of unraveling this mystery on your own?

"No, thanks. I'm the kind of guy that always spoils the ending for himself before finishing a book."

"Fair enough. You see, Barry, a time weaver is a person with a natural talent for manipulating time. They are immune to all time affecting spells, they can freeze time, slow down time and even reverse it with enough practice. They also have a gift of seeing into the future, although it's more blurred visions than anything else. Time weavers are extremely rare, and are said to only appear at the dawn of a new age. They usually lead normal lives until their powers awaken suddenly. The last known appearance of a time weaver occurred some six hundred years ago."

For a moment, it seemed like time was starting to resume its course again. I could hear Daren's shouting, the dragon's roar, the wind blowing in my ear, and I could see the grass start moving. Then everything froze back again, as if nothing had happened.

"Time is running out, Barry," Eiden says. "The time freezing spell won't last much longer."

As Eiden vanishes completely, time is slowly starting to resume its course. I take the stillwater's advice and quickly conjure a protective barrier around Kate and Daren. It's amazing how natural this is feeling. It's as if I've been casting spells my entire life. Is this really the true power of my stat device?
Just as I finish casting my spell, time unfreezes itself and the dragon's fire hits my magical barrier head on. The flames then  disperse into the air, while Kate looks around her, shocked at the discovery of the newly formed barrier protecting her.

"Daren, did you..."

"No, it wasn't me. This barrier is leagues stronger than anything I could ever conjure. I don't know who did this."

"You!" the dragon Tyrath shouts from high above in the sky, while pointing at me. "You did this! It does not matter. All you've managed to achieve is to make yourself my next target. Prepare to die!"

I conjure another protective barrier around me and Rose just in time to defend us from the incoming flames. My barrier is holding up much better than Daren's. There's no sign of it breaking any time soon, and I'm barely even feeling the heat outside of it. 
The question is, what am I going to do now? Looking at my device, I can see that my stats have remained exactly the same and I have no extra available points, so then what did Eiden do to it? I'll need to figure this out later. 

At any rate, judging by the amount of extra energy I can sense in the stat device and the speed at which it's getting consumed, I'd say that the estimate Eiden gave me is spot on. I have less than five minutes to finish this fight, but even with all this magical power, the dragon may well pulverize me in a one on one fight if I don't do this right. Both Daren and Kate are too exhausted to assist me, so I'm on my own for the time being.  Even as I'm standing here thinking, time is running out, but can I afford to just start fighting without any plan whatsoever?

Having all these powers means nothing if I just sit here and let them go to waste. I'm going to have to improvise. First things first, I need to get out of this barrier without getting burnt to a crisp. 
I cast a spell to protect myself from fire, and then a spell that enables flight. I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.

Let's try acid first. I make a ball of acid and send it flying towards the dragon. Tyrath claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that scatters the acid, and sends me spinning backwards. That disoriented me a bit, so it took me a few seconds to figure out where the dragon went. Once I locate him, I send a powerful jet of water in his direction. The dragon gets pushed back by the force of the impact, but aside from that, it does not look like he took any damage.

ID: Ch6-Plan
TEXT: 

Going in without a plan would be suicidal. I'll just have to use this time as efficiently as I can. First of all, I need to think about my defenses. I now have access to dozens of powerful protection spells, but it would take me three minutes to cast all of them. 
Even if I use the time freezing spell Eiden cast just now, that would still only save me about two minutes, and I'll become unable to use the spell for the remainder of the battle. Then again, the time stopping spell isn't really suited for combat, since the spell breaks as soon as I move a few feet or interact with anyone who's frozen, so this may well be the best time to use it. Or maybe I should try to limit casting to only what is absolutely necessary?

Let's see... The one thing I'll need the most is protection from fire. I can't just spend my whole fight trapped inside this barrier, and this spell will grant me some immunity from flames. It'll still feel like I'm in an oven, but at least I won't be burnt to a crisp. 

Aside from that, judging by how I've seen the dragon fight so far, I think I could also use some protection from physical damage, to defend me from his claw attacks. It won't be enough to stop him from killing me if he lands a strike, but maybe it'll help me deflect some of his hits.  

The strong wind he can generate with his wings might also be a problem. It felt like I was trying to fight a hurricane when the dragon first made his appearance, so I guess I could also use some spells that give me protection from wind.
Other than that, it's anyone's guess. It is said that some of the older dragons can cast magic, but I do not know if Tyrath is one of them. More than that, I have no way of knowing which kind of magic he'd be specialized in.

I'm going to have to decide which protection spells I cast in the limited time I have at my disposal.

ID: Ch6-Offense
TEXT: 

The dragon sees that his fire breath isn't working, so he tries to dive in again. My barrier is too strong to be broken as easily as Daren's though, so he'll be busy for a while.
Now that I've established my defensive strategy, I need to think about the offensive. With the spells I have access to now, I have almost limitless choices, but I'll have to think of a tactic that can defeat Tyrath in the few minutes I have left.

I'm going to definitely need to cast a flight spell on myself, since it will be too difficult to engage the dragon otherwise. 

The thing I'm lacking the most here is information about my enemy. All I have to go on are legends and fairy tales, and I'm not sure how much I can rely on any of them in this situation. One thing that most legends agree on is that dragons have a high elemental resistance to fire and that they are immune to mind affecting spells and illusions. Other than that, I have no idea which spells would work best.

I already know that Kate's ice didn't really hurt the dragon, but maybe water would be a better choice? Water is after all the opposing element to fire. Actually, forget water, if I am to try elemental magic I may as well try them all, except fire of course.

Daren's sword seemed to at least be able to get through the dragon's tough scales but I do not know what enchantments he has on it. Maybe I could persuade him to give me his sword for the duration of this battle, and then I can fight Tyrath head on? The downside to this plan is that I don't seem to have a strength enhancing spell in my repertoire, so the power of my swing would depend entirely on my strength stat.

Shapeshifting magic is pretty useless in this situation, because of two main reasons. First of all, these spells cannot be used to transform into something much bigger than my actual size, so it's not like I can just turn into a dragon and fight Tyrath on equal footing. Secondly, you cannot cast spells while shapeshifted, so my mobility would be greatly reduced because I couldn't teleport. It's just not worth it any way I look at it.
Using summoning magic is out of the question as well, since none of these spells were designed to fight an enemy of this caliber. The most any of the summoned creatures could do is moderately inconvenience Tyrath or provide a distraction.

Maybe I'm thinking in too small of a scale, though. With the powers I have at my disposal right now, I could be doing a lot more damage. I could literally make a tornado out of thin air, or use earth magic to animate a rock giant that would dwarf the dragon and who could smash him between its hands. I could also make a blizzard, a lightning storm, a rain of acid and even a rain of meteorites. 

The problem with all of these big spells is that it's almost impossible to prevent collateral damage, so I'd be forced to cast a lot of protections on Daren, Kate, Rose and even myself  beforehand to make sure we're all safe, which would take me about a minute. The time freezing spell wouldn't save me much time in this case, since we're relatively far apart from each other, and moving would cancel the time stopping effect.

Half a minute of my time is already up. I'll need to decide fast.

For a moment, I could see the dragon appear in two places at the same time, as if he'd cloned himself, but then the clone disappears. Wait a minute. I know this effect! That's what happens when someone casts an illusion right in front of you. Was that gust of wind from before meant to disorient me so that I wouldn't see this?

I cast a spell on myself that allows me to see through illusions. Sure enough, the dragon in front of me disappears as soon as I cast the spell, and I see the real Tyrath closing in on me from the right.

I mimic his earlier move and clap my hands, which creates an incredibly strong blast of air in front of me, sending the dragon back about fifty feet. 
"I don't know how you were able to see through my illusion, human, but I'm not going to take it easy on you anymore."

After finishing his phrase, the dragon immediately appears in front of me and swings one of his claws at my chest. It was all I could do to teleport out of harm's way in time, with a short range spell suited for combat. 

The dragon and I spend the next few seconds teleporting one after the other and trying to take each  other by surprise.

Damn it! If only I could cast my big spells now, I'd make short work of him. I think I can still make it if I go and cast the protection spells on the others right now.

I start off by freezing time, and then I proceed to cast every single protection spell I know on myself, as well as a flight spell.
Next, I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.

Let's try acid first. I make a ball of acid and send it flying towards the dragon. Tyrath claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that scatters the acid, but my protection from wind spell prevents me from being blown away. 

The dragon is now casting an illusion of himself, and leaving it behind, while he tries to approach me from the right. It's a good thing I already cast a protection from illusions before starting this fight. He can't surprise me like this.

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks me as I reach them. "This magic power radiating from you... It's insane!"

"I'm sorry, there's no time to explain. But I think I have enough power to beat the dragon on my own. Can I borrow your sword for a few minutes?"

"Beat the dragon on your own?... Barry, I don't..."

Daren pauses for a bit to think about what I've said.

"Fine, here's the sword. Just don't do anything too crazy."

I take his sword and prepare to fly out of the barrier to face the dragon.

Tyrath quickly whips his tail towards me and grabs me with it. The force with which he's gripping me is suffocating. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?

"You're not the only one who can cast magic, human," the dragon says.

The force of his tail's grip is so strong that I can feel it crushing my internal organs. As I cough up some blood, I can feel my vision starting to blur. The last thing I see is the dragon's hideous face, as he laughs triumphantly.

Tyrath whips his tail towards me and attempts to grab me with it. There was no time for me to dodge the hit, so I instinctively cast the time freezing spell that Eiden used earlier, stopping his tail a few inches before reaching me. My heart is beating like crazy. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?

I cast a spell that allows me to see through illusions, as well as a spell to protect me from wind, and another one to protect me from physical damage. This should be enough for now. 

I mimic the dragon's earlier move and clap my hands, which immediately cancels my time freezing spell and creates an incredibly strong blast of air in front of me, sending the dragon back about fifty feet.

I shoot a bolt of lightning at him, which hits him head on, although it doesn't seem to have affected him in any way. Suddenly, the dragon in front of me disappears and a different dragon appears behind me.

Tyrath whips his tail towards me and attempts to grab me with it. There was no time for me to dodge the hit, so I instinctively cast the time freezing spell that Eiden used earlier, stopping his tail a few inches before reaching me. My heart is beating like crazy. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?

I use my sword to slash at the dragon's tail, which immediately unfreezes time, and the dragon screams in pain as I draw blood with my blade. He then teleports back twenty feet and shouts to me.

After finishing his phrase, the dragon immediately appears in front of me and swings one of his claws at my chest. It was all I could do to teleport out of harm's way in time, with a short range spell suited for combat. 

Me and the dragon spend the next few seconds teleporting one after the other and trying to take each  other by surprise. This is getting me nowhere. I unleash a powerful explosion of fire all around me, which pushes the dragon back a few feet, but it doesn't harm him in the slightest. 

That's right. The legends always said that dragons are immune to flames, as well as mind affecting spells and illusions. Damn it, there's so many big spells I could cast right now, but almost all of them would endanger Kate, Daren, Rose and even myself. I'd have to get back to the others and cast some protection spells before I start shooting tornados out of my fingertips. If I do it now, I might still have time to finish this fight before my five minutes are up.

The dragon then breathes fire hotter than ever before towards me. Instinctively, I hold the sword in front of me to defend from his attack. To my surprise, I see that the sword actually absorbs all of the dragon's flames into it, and it is now radiating magical power, looking as though it has been set ablaze.

Daren's sword could do something like this? What kind of crazy enchantments are on this thing anyway? Does this mean I can actually now use the dragon's flames as my own?

I slash my sword towards the dragon, which sends all of his flames back towards him, concentrated in one powerful beam.

It worked! I can't believe it! Let me try and see if it can also absorb other magical elements. I concentrate my magical power on the sword in the form of lightning. I can feel the sword charge up and as I finish my spell, I can actually see the electrical current surging through it.

As Tyrath flies towards me, I swing my sword at him, which unleashes a powerful lightning attack that hits him head on. That doesn't affect the dragon in the slightest and when he reaches me, he attacks me with his claws again. 
I teleport out of his range, and try to think fast of what my next move should be. Fire doesn't work, lightning doesn't work, ice doesn't work either and I don't see how powering this sword with air, water or earth would do any good. That only leaves acid as an option, but the question is, will the acid get absorbed into the sword like all the other elements, or will it completely melt through the metal?

There's only one way to find out.

Casting protection spells on everyone would waste too much time. I'll just have to make better use of my offensive spells. 
I use my earth magic to break the rocky soil into pieces, and make the big chunks of rock fly all the way to my position. I then get all the rocks to spin around me at great speed, using them as a shield against the dragon. If he tries any more surprise teleports, he's going to get pummeled. 

I pull more chunks of rock out of the ground and send them all flying at Tyrath. He tries to teleport out of their way, but there's too many of them, and he gets hit by a few. He roars furiously. Finally, I did some damage to him. 

I take out even more rocks from the ground and make them all follow him, as he tries to fly out of their way. The rocks are only increasing in number, because he can't take them out with his claws faster than I can make them. 

After getting hit a few more times, Tyrath shoots out flames hotter than ever before, turning all of my rocks into molten lava. He then flies right through the lava and heads for me again. He breathes his fire towards me, and turns all of the rocks rotating around me into lava as well. This is no good. Lava isn't solid enough to inconvenience him, and he can simply shrug off the hotness of it given his resistance to fire.

I let go of the lava that's rotating around me, and shoot a beam of lightning out of my hands, big enough to engulf the whole dragon in it. This does not stop Tyrath from his flight, and I'm forced to again teleport out of his way when he reaches me. Lightning doesn't work either. If he can melt rock that easily, then he'll have no trouble against water. What the hell am I supposed to use against him? Acid?
I surround the dragon with a sphere of acid, and I try to envelop him in it. Tyrath lets out a much more powerful roar than before. So powerful, in fact that it creates an explosion of air all around him, and sends my acid flying all over the place. His roar was so loud that I had to use a spell to avoid losing consciousness. I can only hope that Daren and the others have access to sonic protection as well. 

"Insolent wretch!" the dragon screams. "There won't be a single speck of dust left of you when I'm finished!"

Tyrath starts teleporting for me again, but this time he's doing it faster. I can barely keep up with him anymore. What the hell am I doing? I am in control of more magical power than I ever dreamed would be possible, but I can't hold off a single dragon?!

It's all or nothing. If we all die here, it's not like Daren will need this sword anymore anyway. Let's do this.
I cast my acid spell on the sword, and watch it slowly turn green, as steam starts coming out of it. The sword is now drenching in acid, but the corrosive agent is not eating away at the metal as one would normally expect. Instead, it seems to be empowering it. This sword is definitely an impressive piece of work. If Daren actually had any access to elemental magic, he'd be unstoppable.

This is it. This is the winning card I've been waiting for. The dragon doesn't stand a chance anymore.

I teleport right next to Tyrath and thrust my blade into his chest. The acid melts through his scales, and the sword passes through his tough skin like a hot knife through butter. The dragon starts screaming in pain, and he teleports away, shooting flames at me. I block them with my sword, but this replaces the acid effect it had before with a fire one. So that's how this thing works. 

I throw the fire back towards Tyrath, and cast acid on the sword once more. I teleport next to him again, and I strike at him with my acid empowered sword. He blocks my attack with one of his claws, but the sword still goes through his thick skin. 
The dragon spends the next minute on the defensive, teleporting away from my attacks and shooting fire at me, while I try to anticipate his moves and teleport after him. He manages to dodge most of my attacks, but the few strikes that hit him are  causing him quite a bit of damage. At this rate I won't have any trouble finishing him by the time I run out of magic.

I've already decided that I need Daren's sword to win this fight. The risk to lose the blade by casting acid on it is much too great to be worth it.

I'm going to have to make this quick. I teleport next to the dragon and thrust my blade into his chest.

The sword barely scratches his armored scales, and the dragon takes advantage of my failed attack to swing his right claw at me. I manage to block his strike with my sword, but he then almost immediately whips his tail at me, forcing me to teleport away from him.

I spend the next twenty seconds teleporting in and out of the dragon's range, trying to shatter his armored scales, but it's no use. I can't even get close to reaching his skin with my blade. 

Now Tyrath has gone on the offensive. He's teleporting faster and forcing me to spend my time dodging his attacks instead of looking for openings. I can barely even keep up with him anymore.

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks me. "This magic power radiating from you... It's insane!"

"I'll explain later. I don't have much time, and I'll need to concentrate as much as possible on casting these protection spells."

I raise my hands in the air and feel all of my magical power flow through me. This is what I've always wanted. This is what I've been looking for all my life. I'm not going to let one single dragon stand in my way.
I start by creating a tornado. The wind around me is now so strong that it's literally breaking chunks of rock from the ground and making them fly around me, clashing with the trees that are getting uprooted one by one. It's almost like a scenario from a horror book. 

The dragon is struggling to keep himself airborne, while my protections from wind are allowing me to fly through the currents with ease. Next, I use my earth magic to animate a giant made out of rock. The ground trembles violently, as an enormous rock golem rises from it slowly, making it seem like it had been simply sleeping all of this time. Once it gets up, I can see that the giant measures at an impressive two hundred feet, and once it spots the dragon, it uses its huge hands to crush him between them.

Tyrath lets out a deafening roar. A roar so powerful that it creates an explosion of air all around him, and it actually shatters the giant's hands, setting the dragon free. That was so loud that I had to use a spell to avoid losing my consciousness. I can only hope that Daren and the others have access to sonic protection as well.

Even though he managed to get out, it's clear that Tyrath has taken a lot of damage from my last attack. He's now breathing fire hotter than ever before, engulfing my rock giant in flames and turning him into molten lava.
Try all you want, little dragon, but you won't escape my grasp. Nothing can stop me now. 

Dozens of volcanoes are starting to erupt from the earth below as I use even more magical power, this time to call upon a rain of acid. The dragon screams as the acid burns through its wings, and he starts to desperately shoot fire everywhere above him, in order to burn all of the acid before it reaches him. I teleport next to Tyrath and point my palms towards him,  blowing him away with a powerful explosion of air that stuns him for a few seconds. Since I've interrupted him from burning the drops of acid, the rain is now once more pouring on him, and the dragon starts to scream in pain again.

It's over. He's no match for me. The time I have left will be more than enough to finish him off for good.

Everything seems to be moving much slower all of a sudden. Or am I just the one moving faster? I can predict the dragon's attack before he even teleports in front of me, but I don't feel the need to dodge anymore. Instead, I simply block Tyrath's next claw strike with my left hand.

While I keep a grip on him with my left hand, I punch him in the chest with my right fist. The impact of my strike was so strong that I could feel some of his armored scales shatter from the force of my blow, as the dragon gets sent flying more than twenty feet backwards. Tyrath coughs up blood, and starts to speak, but I do not let him. I instantly teleport next to him and grab him by the tail. I then throw him into the ground, and when he collides with the earth he creates a huge crater and sends clouds of dust flying in all directions. 

One more hit should settle this. As I prepare to dash towards Tyrath to deliver the finishing blow, I can feel my powers starting to leave me. 

No! Not now! I was going to finish this. I was winning! I'm nowhere near my five minutes limit. How did I expend all of my magical energy in just a few seconds? Was it because of the sudden power up I got just now?
Please, it can't all end like this. I just need to deliver one more strike. One more strike is all I need. Please...

It's too late. I can't even maintain my flight spell anymore. I'm falling. There's no way I'll survive a fall from this height. Daren and Kate are too far to help me. Is this it for me? After all that's happened, am I simply going to die pathetically like this?

Just before I reach the ground, I suddenly stop in mid-air and then I fall flat on my face, from a height of about three feet. How did I do that? Did I manage to gather my last few drops of power in order to save myself?

"How disappointing," I hear Eiden's voice from high above in the sky. "How very disappointing. Barry, I was expecting a lot more from you. I didn't give you all of that magical energy just so you could waste it by activating your device's temporary maximized mode."

Eiden sighs. 

"Of course you don't," he says. "Take a look at your stat device. You'll understand when you see for yourself."

I take the stat device out of my pocket and look at its screen. What... What am I looking at here, exactly?

The numbers are all over the place. Every single one of my stats is far exceeding its maximum number, but they're dropping at a very fast rate. Now I understand what happened. I must have accidentally used all of the energy that Eiden pumped into my device in order to temporarily maximize all of the stats. That's why I suddenly got so powerful. That's why I didn't recognize the spell. 

"Do you understand now, Barry? The energy I gave you was never meant to be used like that. Magical energy doesn't grow on trees, you know? You should use it with more care."

"Eiden..." the dragon says, as he gets up and soars into the air again. "I've been looking for you." 
The stillwater smiles.

"Tyrath! It feels like it's been a century since I last saw you! Or has it really been that long? I don't remember. Come give your old friend a hug!"

"I was going to bait you out using the bodies of your lackeys, but it looks like that is no longer necessary. Today we end this, once and for all."

"Come now, Tyrath! Don't be so melodramatic. You're ruining our happy reunion!"

Instead of replying, the dragon blasts Eiden with his fire breath. The stillwater points his finger at the flames, and they stop in front of him. He then gestures towards the dragon with his hand, and the flames head back towards Tyrath, hitting him head on.

"I see you're still up to your old tricks," the dragon says. "But I've become a lot more powerful since you left. This won't be like the last time."

Tyrath rushes towards Eiden, but he teleports behind the dragon, and shoots a beam of fire at him. Tyrath shrugs off the flames, and breathes his own fire at the stillwater again.  Just like last time, Eiden sends the flames back, but this time he also surrounds the dragon with four pillars of fire that explode in his face.
What is he doing? Doesn't he know that dragons are resistant to fire? Why does he keep attacking him like this?

"Do you mock me, stillwater?" Tyrath says. "If you don't start fighting seriously, you're going to be sorry."

Eiden says nothing, but keeps smiling at the dragon with his eyes closed. He is now flooding the whole sky with flames, and teleporting away every time the dragon tries to reach him. They're teleporting after each other so fast that I can barely tell what's happening anymore. The whole sky looks like it's on fire, as the two combatants' vague outlines are occasionally visible through the flames.

Suddenly, the whole area gets covered in a blue light, and I'm starting to feel an immense magical power coming from the air all around us.

"What is the meaning of this?" the dragon asks.
"Has it been so long you've forgotten, old friend?" Eiden says. "Just because they haven't been activated in more than a millennia does not mean these traps are out of function. This one was just a bit out of tune, that's all. So I had to warm it up before it would start working again!"

"You can't mean..."

Eiden's smile widens.

"The lessathi have many flaws, but poor craftsmanship is not one of them. Most of the artifacts they built in the old times are still fully functional after all!"

As the two of them speak, the ground is shaking violently, and the blue light is intensifying.

"Listen to me, stillwater. Your little tricks won't last forever. This won't keep me away for long. And when I get out, you're going to wish you were never born. Do you hear me?! Wipe that smile off your face, you lowborn little--"

All of the magic in the air gets unleashed in a single moment, and the dragon gets teleported away, as the blue light disappears and the earthquake slowly stops.

Eiden turns back to me.

"I hope you won't miss him too much. It'll be a while before we see him again."

The trap was supposed to get activated at the first sign of flames, but because it's been at least a thousand years since it was last used, its mechanism was a little rusty.

"Damn it, Barry! You're not planning to make this any easier for me, are you?"

"He saved all of our lives!" Rose says. "I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave Barry all of those powers that allowed him to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?"

"It's because he is our enemy," Kate tells her bluntly. "When we first met him this morning, he tried to kill Daren outright and ultimately decided against it, on a whim. If what you're saying is true, and he really did save all of our lives, then I am inclined to believe that this was also a decision he made on a whim. What was the motivation he gave for saving the four of us?"

Kate's rebuttal made Rose lose a bit of steam.

"He, uh..."
She pauses.

"He said that he couldn't let the dragon win, after having gloated like a villain from a children's storybook..."

"Well, there you have it. But never mind Eiden's intentions. What I am most interested in knowing is how you both got to interact with him in the middle of our fight, when neither me nor Daren saw him appear until the end of the battle."

"He froze time," I tell her.

"Froze time?!" Daren asks, perplexed. "How is that even possible?"

"Beats me. He just snapped his fingers and made time stop for everyone except me and him."

"Wait,  what about Rose?" Kate asks.

"He said... that I was able to resist his spell because I'm a time weaver," Rose answers her.

"What the hell is a time weaver?" Kate says.

"Kate, could you freeze the whole area around us? I want to make sure that Eiden isn't hiding around us invisibly and listening to what we're saying."
Kate nods, and she sends a powerful wave of freezing magic all around us. The air has suddenly gotten a lot chillier, and all of the trees now look like they're made of crystal, but there's no sign of the stillwater. Even if he got to block Kate's attack, we would still have sensed at least some magical power coming from him if he were still here. I guess he really did just teleport away after all.

"I don't understand," Rose says. "What's gotten into everyone? Eiden saved all of our lives! I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave Barry all of those powers that allowed him to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?"

"Rose, did you start feeling any different after having withstood Eiden's spell?" Daren asks her. 

"No... I feel exactly the same as before. I think he was mistaken. I can't have time powers. His spell must have just malfunctioned, that's all."

"Hmm... Perhaps you're right," Daren says. "At any rate, we should be thankful enough that we somehow managed to make it out of this alive.

Daren proceeds to heal us all in turn. When he starts healing Kate, I can clearly see that he's having some difficulty.

"I'm sorry, Kate," Daren says, as he finishes his spell. "This is all I can do for you. Your wounds were just too deep to heal completely."
Looking at Kate, I can see that Daren has healed most of the damage made by the dragon's fire, but the left side of her face is still lightly scarred. Surprisingly, it does not look bad on her. Kate, after all, never really had a very feminine look to begin with. Her beauty was always more feral in nature, and her newly acquired scars complement it nicely. 

"It's no problem," Kate tells Daren while looking at her face through a mirror made of ice. "Most people were already calling me a monster and running away when they first saw me. At least now they'll have a legitimate reason for it."

The menacing look she has in her eyes is made all the more scary by the newly acquired scars on her face.

Once Daren finishes healing us all, we waste no more time and resume our journey, in order to avoid meeting any mages or creatures that may have been attracted by the loud noises of our previous battle.
"I still don't understand one thing, Barry," Kate tells me, as we walk side by side. "How did Eiden manage to give you all of those powers? As far as I know, transferring powers between mages is impossible without some kind of tool to assist them."

"Oh, he used my stat device. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but he made it start glowing, and then I suddenly got all of those spells. I've tried playing around with the stat booster ever since, in order to see if I could unlock some secret options or something, but I couldn't figure out how he did it."

"Wait, you're saying you got all of those powers through your stat device? No, that's impossible! In order for that to work, you'd need to have even less magical power than a human, otherwise it wouldn't match at all with the magical frequency of the device."

She pauses.

"Actually, come to think of it, your magical aura was always weaker than that of a normal human. Very weak, in fact. Almost as if you were a..."

Kate suddenly stops in her tracks, and looks straight at me. The look in her eyes slowly turns into one of both sheer terror and sudden understanding. Then, her look becomes dark. Darker than I've ever seen it before, as she continues to look me straight in the eyes.
"Almost as if I were a... what?"

"Never mind. It wasn't important. Let's catch up with the others, we're lagging behind again."

The tone in her voice was as cold as her freezing magic. She does not say another word to me, and goes to catch up with Daren and Rose. 

Great. Just what we needed. More underlying conflict in our group. I'm sure this can only end well for everyone.
