 "Do not worry, your highness," Albert says. "I will have a talk with him later, in order to straighten things out. I assure you that it will not happen again."
"Very well," the king says. "In that case, you are all dismissed. Feel free to contact me at any time if you have anything important to tell me. I will be here in my throne room, for the rest of the day."

"Duly noted," Daren says. "Come on, let's go back to the waiting room." 

"Well, that was.... quite the talk," Hadrik says, as soon as we exit the throne room.

"Indeed," Daren says, as we are making our way back to the waiting room. "It's going to be interesting to see how things will develop from here on out, that's for sure."

"Do you think they might try to get rid of us?" Hadrik says.

"I highly doubt that they would," Daren says in a low voice, as he makes sure that Peter and Albert are not within hearing range of us. "Especially since they suspect us of being Eiden's allies. They'd have to be completely mad to risk making him into their enemy without any reason at all. Still, I suggest that we continue this conversation once we get back to the waiting room, because I don't like looking over my shoulder every few seconds to make sure that I'm not being spied on."

Once we arrive in the waiting room, we wait until Peter and Albert are no longer in sight, and then we resume our talk, in a low enough voice that the other people present in the room cannot hear us.

 "Anyway," Daren says. "I'd say that these recent events complicate our situation quite a bit. What do you all recommend we should do? Are we going to keep cooperating with the king, or maybe we should start thinking about going our own separate ways?"
"I don't know what to say..." Hadrik says. "The information that these rebels can obtain from their listening devices is pretty useful, to be honest."

"Agreed," Daren says. "The only problem is that we don't know if they'll keep sharing this sort of stuff with us or not from now on. I think it might be better to keep this 'alliance' going until we can figure out if we're still getting something out of it or not. Kate, what do you say?"

"Do what you want," Kate says, as she turns around and starts heading towards one of the exits. "I'm going back to my training. Melindra, let's go."

"Uhh, sure," Melindra says, as she begins to follow Kate. "Right behind you."

 "Hey, Kate, don't be like that!" Daren says. "Come on!"
Kate doesn't react in any way and she continues to walk forward, with Melindra following closely behind her, until the two of them disappear into one of the corridors leading out of the waiting room.

"Yeah, I don't think Kate wants us to cooperate with the king of the underground," Daren says.

"It's no wonder," Illuna says. "She more or less openly declared that she doesn't trust him at all only a few minutes ago. Obviously, she's not going to be thrilled at the idea of us maintaining our alliance with him."

"Yeah, but I wasn't saying we should become buddies with him or anything," Daren says. "I was just suggesting that we could try to keep the alliance going for a little while longer, until we figure out if we're actually benefiting from it or not..."

"Maybe we should give her some time," Hadrik says. "She might change her mind once she clears her head a little."

 "I suppose..." Daren says. "Alright, let's all continue with what we were doing, and we'll meet up again later. Arraka, are you up for a second round of aura study?"
"Sure, whatever," Arraka says. "Not like I have anything better to do, anyway."

"Barry, there you are!" I hear Leila's father calling out to me, as most of my friends are now each heading in separate directions to continue their previous activities.

Leila's father is now approaching me, while holding my stat booster in his hand. As soon as he gets close enough to me and Leila, he stops in his tracks and then he extends his hand towards me, in order to give me back my device.

"I wanted to tell you that I'm done working on your stat booster," Leila's father says, as I grab my device from his hand and take a good look at it. "However, you should give it a little time before it adjusts to the changes I've made. At the moment, the device isn't functional, but normally it should start working by itself after a while. If it still doesn't work until tomorrow, I'll take another look at it to make sure that everything's okay."

 "Did you manage to unlock all of the aura stats?"
"Yes, the Magical Sense, Bluff and Aura Hardening stats should all be available to you once your device starts working again," Leila's father says. "Also, I think I should let you know that the stat devices are made in such a way that your stat point distribution gets automatically reset when you unlock the hidden aura stats. In other words, as soon as your device starts working again, your stats will all be at zero, and you will have all of your available points to spend at your leisure once more."

"Wow, that's amazing!" I say. "Does this mean that it's possible to reset the stats multiple times, if you hide the aura stats and then unlock them again?"

"To be quite honest, I wouldn't risk it," Leila's father says. "These devices are very old, and a full stat reset puts a lot of strain on them. That's the reason why you aren't given the option to just remove points from your stats at will after you've already spent them. The only reason why I even let the stat reset happen is because I wasn't given a choice in the matter, but trying to reset your stats multiple times on purpose may well cause some of your points to become unusable, or it may even cause your stat device to stop working altogether. My advice is to be happy that no damage was done with this reset, and to be very careful when you choose what stats to level up from now on, because you likely won't be getting another chance like this again."

 "Yes, there was one last thing I wanted to tell you about your device," Leila's father says. "When I removed your stat booster from its locked state, the process that is dedicated to converting magical energy into available stat points was reset, so you will be getting one of your stat points earlier than normal. This also means that you will be getting one less point with your next batch, but I think you'd much rather have the stat point available now than later. If I'm not mistaken, your extra point should be available to you as soon as your stat device becomes functional again."
"Alright," I say, as I put the device in my pocket. "I'll make sure to keep that in mind. Thank you for all your help!"

"You're welcome!" Leila's father says. "Oh, and while we're still on the topic of stat boosters... Leila, would you mind coming to my workshop again for a bit? There's one last maintenance check that I forgot to do for your stat device, and I'd prefer to do it now, while I've got some free time."

}
 As I look around the room to decide what I'm going to do next, one particular corridor catches my attention. It is the corridor that Kate and Melindra walked into when they decided to continue their training. Now that I take a better look, I realize that it's not the same corridor as the one they were using to train before the king of the underground called us to his throne room. Why would they choose a different corridor than last time? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to train in a place that they are already familiar with?
Wait a minute... I'm pretty sure that there was a way to get from that corridor right into the tunnel that leads to the teleporter room. Could this be where the two of them are actually headed? I guess there's only one way to find out.

I begin heading towards the tunnel that leads directly to the teleporter room at a rapid pace. If I hurry up, I should still be able to catch up to them. This tunnel takes a more direct route towards the teleporter than the one they took, so the distance is much shorter. I rush through the door leading into the corridor, and then I head straight for the teleporter, without looking back. It's fine. If they really went this way, they can't be much further ahead. I should be seeing them any minute now. Any minute now...

My predictions turn out to be true, as I soon catch a glimpse of Kate's green cloak in the distance, and then I slow down my pace, so I can follow her and Melindra without getting noticed. Unfortunately, my plan gets shot to pieces almost immediately, when Melindra suddenly stops walking and calls out to me in a loud voice.

 "Barry, what are you doing?..." Melindra says, as her voice echoes throughout the tunnel.
When I hear her, I panic, and I instinctively try to hide in one of the side tunnels, but it doesn't take me long to realize that this isn't exactly one of my brightest ideas.

"Barry, you do realize that I could sense you approaching us from the first moment you entered this corridor, right?" Melindra says. "How could you possibly think even for a second that trying to sneak up on us would be a good idea?..."

"Okay, I'll admit that this wasn't really one of my best plans," I say, as I step back into the main tunnel and start getting closer to them. "But still, I didn't expect to actually run into you here! Where are you two going?"

"Where does it look like we're going?" Melindra says. "Really, Barry, if you were smart enough to find us, it shouldn't be that hard for you to figure out what we're trying to do."

"Yes, but why?" I say, as I finally reach them. "If you wanted to have a talk with the Overseer before the king of the underground's men had a chance to do it, then why go by yourselves? Why didn't you try to at least talk to us about any of this?"

 "Isn't it obvious?..." Melindra says. "It's because Kate didn't want to be a bother to you. She already feels responsible for having singlehandedly ruined your alliance with the king of the underground, and she didn't want to put even more pressure on you by saying that she was planning to meet the Overseer by herself. And besides, who would she have asked for help? You don't have your stat device, Leila has only just been reunited with her long lost father, Flower and Illuna are still fighting, Daren is busy with curing that plague, and Hadrik has been gloomy all day. You should know by now that Kate isn't the type to ask anyone for help if she thinks she might be inconveniencing them."
"It doesn't seem to me like she had a problem inconveniencing you, though..." I say.

 "Of course not!" Melindra says, with a proud look on her face. "When you are good enough of a friend with someone, you no longer need to worry about inconveniencing that person when you're asking for help. After all, isn't that what friends are all about? Being able to inconvenience each other without having to worry that you'll end up getting hated for it?"
"You know, Melindra," Kate says, "when you told me earlier that I should leave all the talking to you because you knew how to deal with Barry, this isn't exactly what I had in mind."

"It isn't?" Melindra asks, looking genuinely surprised. "Why not?"

"You know why!" Kate says. "I thought you were going to convince him to go back to the waiting room, not tell him all of our plans!"

 "Don't be like that, icey!" Melindra says. "You know full well that what you really wanted was for him to come with us!"
"No, I didn't!" Kate says.

"Of course you did," Melindra says. "If you really wanted him to not come with us, we could have easily hidden in one of the side tunnels, back when I first detected him, and he would have never found us. But you never even suggested that we do such a thing. Now, why is that, I wonder?"

"I... just didn't think about it, that's all..." Kate says, in a hesitant tone.

"Oh?" Melindra says, with a smug smile on her face. "Is that why you kept turning your head towards every side-tunnel that we passed since I told you that Barry was following us? Because you weren't thinking about it?"

"Shut up..." Kate says.

"It's okay to be honest with yourself every once in a while, you know," Melindra says, still smiling smugly. "Look, it's easy. Just repeat after me: 'I wanted Barry to come with us to the surface'. Come on, you can do it! I believe in you!"

"I am going to hit you..." Kate says.

"Is it me, or are you two getting along a little better than usual?" I say.

"What are you talking about?" Kate says, as she raises an eyebrow. "When have the two of us not been getting along?"

"Uhh... on the very first day that we began traveling together, for example?..." I say.

 "Oh, that was ages ago!" Melindra says. "I don't think we have even gotten into a single argument since that day when we defeated Talmak together. Have we, icey?"
"You're right," Kate says. "We have not."

"If you two say so..." I tell them.

"Anyway, so now that we got that settled, let's all go to the Overseer together!" Melindra says. "I know my way around the city pretty well, so I think I may have a general idea of where we could find one of the green-eyed golem heads without getting caught by any of the guards."

"You two are not planning to give up on this plan no matter what I say, are you?" I ask them.

"Obviously," Melindra says.

"Fine," I say. "How do we convince the teleporter guy to bring us to the surface, then?"

"No!" Kate says, as she places herself in front of me. "Barry, you can't come with us!"

 "Why not?" I say.
"Because you don't have your stat device!" Kate says. "You'll be defenseless!"

"Well, technically I do have my stat booster with me," I say, as I take my device out of my pocket to show it to her for a few seconds before putting it back inside. "It's just that it's not really working right now. But it's supposed to start working again in a few hours or less. And even if it doesn't, I'm Barry the reckless, remember? I'm sure that I'll handle myself in one way or another."

"I thought you were supposed to be working on being less reckless," Kate tells me.

"True, but technically you were supposed to be working on trusting your friends more too, so I guess we're even," I say.

"Do you guys have room for one more, or are you done taking extra passengers?" we suddenly see a blue text floating in front of us.

As we turn around, we see that Leila is now slowly approaching us as well, smiling faintly.

"Should I take it that you already know what's going on, then?" I say.

"Yeah, I kind of got that figured out the moment I sensed Kate and Melindra's presence in the tunnel," Leila writes. "It's not like there could have been that many reasons for them to want to go outside in the first place."

"I was afraid that this might be the case," we hear Breynan's voice, as he dismisses his invisibility spell and slowly begins materializing out of thin air, some fifty feet away from our location.

Well, I'm the one who's interacted the most with him out of everyone in this place. I know how he thinks! There are many ways in which I can assist you if you decide to take me with you. I can help you find the green-eyed metal balls faster. I can also find a good enough excuse that will convince Barry to teleport us to the surface without making him suspicious. The only thing I ask in return is for you to let me be the one to talk first with the Overseer."
"And how do we know that you won't just leak our entire conversation with the Overseer to your king when we get back?" Kate says.

"I won't tell the king anything, I swear!" Breynan says. "I know how things might look like from an outsider's perspective, but not all of us rebels are completely subservient to the king of the underground. Some of us still have our pride. I won't let the king walk all over me like he does with Peter and Albert every day. The king knew full well that it was very important for me to participate in these negotiations with the Overseer, but he forbade me to go, simply because he wanted to show me that he's the one in charge. If that's the way things are going to be, then I no longer feel the need to obey all of his orders. I will make my own decisions, based on what I think is right, even if it means risking my position and status in this underground society."

 "It doesn't seem like he's lying," Melindra says. "Not from the feel of his aura, at least."
"I agree," Leila writes. "And if what he says is indeed true, then he wouldn't have any reason to tell the king about our meeting with the Overseer, because that would be like going out of his way to notify him of his betrayal."

Kate sighs.

"Breynan," she says, "I can't say that I entirely trust you, but I'll admit that I'd rather have you coming with us than leaving you here and giving you an actual reason to want to rat us out to your king. If everyone else is also okay with this, let us move forward. I wouldn't want anyone else to catch up to us before we can get to the teleporter room."

There is a short pause before we hear Daren's voice again.

"I called to tell you that Kate, Melindra, Leila and I are just about to go meet the Overseer on our own, behind the king's back," I say. "Oh, and Breynan's coming with us too."

"What?!" Daren shouts very loudly.

"Daren, what did I just tell you about overreacting?..." I say.

"Right, right, sorry about that..." Daren says, now in a lower voice. "But still, why would you do such a thing? Weren't we going to wait until tomorrow to make a decision?"

"Listen," I say. "Kate was about to go out there only with Melindra before we intercepted her. She was feeling guilty about ruining our alliance with the king and she wanted to take matters into her own hands. She's not planning to stop no matter what we say."

 "Actually, I think you should stay there and deal with the plague," I say. "Remember that you only have a week until your disease becomes contagious. You shouldn't interrupt your work unless it's absolutely necessary. Don't worry about us. We can handle ourselves."
"Okay..." Daren says. "Okay. But promise me that you won't take any unnecessary risks. If you feel like you might be getting ambushed, don't think twice about it and ask to be teleported back immediately, you hear?"

"Yeah, yeah, we'll be careful," I say.

"Alright," Daren says. "Don't forget to call me when you get back."

"We won't forget," I say. "Okay, I'm closing the transceiver now. Take care."

I then tap on the transceiver once, in order to close it, and I put it back in my pocket.

"Sounds like we're good to go," Melindra says. "Let's move."

 "Alright, let's move."
"Breynan, there is a question that I forgot to ask you earlier," Kate says, shortly after we begin making our way towards the teleporter room. "If you were already planning to go behind the king's back and to meet with the Overseer by yourself, why didn't you go alone? Why did you prefer to join up with us?"

"I don't typically go alone on missions, so if I suddenly asked to go out there by myself, I was afraid that it might seem a little suspicious," Breynan says. "Despite my looks, I am not really much of a fighter. I like to carry this sword around with me, but I only use it when absolutely necessary. Usually I'm more of an illusion casting kind of guy, with a bit of healing on the side. That's why my plan is to pretend that I'm taking you all outside in order to teach you the usual guard patrol routes, so we can better cooperate in the future when we go on missions together."

"You think the teleporter guy will buy that story?" I say.

"You mean Barry?" Breynan says. "He'll buy it, don't worry. Just let me do all the talking and we'll be fine."

 "Let's hope you are right," I say.
After a bit more walking we finally reach the teleporter room, where Barry 'thundercloud' is still standing behind the button-filled metal desk that operates the teleporting device behind him. When he sees us, the teleporter guy gives us a wave, and then he greets Breynan.

"Hey there, Breynan," the teleporter guy says. "Are you taking our new 'recruits' on their first mission?"

"More of a training session, actually," Breynan says. "I want to show them the usual guard patrol routes, so they can handle themselves while they're on a mission with us even if our groups need to split up. The last thing we'd want is for them to get into a fight with the royal guards again by mistake."

"Oh, so you're not planning to get into any fights, then," the teleporter guy says.

"Yeah," Breynan says. "Hopefully it will be just a short uneventful trip, and we'll be back right in time for dinner."

"Well, remember that if you do get into a fight, I won't be able to teleport you out of there properly until you're all safely away and you've calmed yourselves down," the teleporter guy says. "We wouldn't want to have another accident, like that time with Desmond."

 "Yes, Barry, we'll be careful," Breynan says.
"Oh, and don't forget to actually return to the designated teleportation area before calling me on the transceiver this time!" the teleporter guy says. "The emergency teleportation feature puts too much strain on this device to be used just for the sake of convenience!"

"Okay, okay, I get it," Breynan says. "Just make sure that you teleport us to the usual coordinates, alright? I don't want us to run into any trouble while we're up there."

"Roger that!" the teleporter guy says, as he presses on some buttons. "Have a safe trip!"

We then get surrounded by a bright white light and we begin to feel our bodies vibrating loudly, as we are being teleported to the surface. Once the teleportation process is complete, we find ourselves standing in the middle of an abandoned alleyway in what appears to be one of the poorer districts of the city. As I look up at the sky, I see that it now has a reddish color, and it likely won't be long until the sun will be setting.

 "This area is very rarely patrolled, so we use it as our regular teleportation spot when we want to get to the surface," Breynan says. "Come with me. I'll show you how you can track down one of those green-eyed metal balls in a matter of minutes, if you know how to look for them."
"What happened during the accident that your friend spoke of earlier?" Kate says, as we all move to follow Breynan. "When he said 'Desmond', was he referring to the same Desmond that now guards the door outside the quarantine zone?"

 "Yes, that was the Desmond he was referring to," Breynan says. "That poor bastard had it rough. He was caught in a nasty fight once, and he asked Barry to teleport him out of there as soon as possible. It was technically against our safety precautions to do such a thing, because the teleporter device is rather old, and it has trouble properly locking onto people's auras if their flow isn't calm enough, but the situation seemed very dire, so Barry took the risk. From what Desmond described to us, the sensation he felt when he got teleported was as if his whole body was being torn to shreds. The moment after he got transported into the tunnels, he started vomiting, and he felt sick for days after that. Even after all this time, Desmond still hasn't gotten over it, and he tries to avoid using the teleporter as much as possible. That's why he personally requested to be made into a simple guard in our rebel base, so that he wouldn't need to teleport to the surface anymore unless there were an extreme emergency."

 "Damn..." I say. "That sounds pretty bad. Did he at least recover fully? Or is he still experiencing problems due to that failed teleportation?"
"He did completely recover in a few days, thankfully," Breynan says. "But we've never tried to do a teleportation like that again since that day. Its effects are just too unpredictable to be worth the risk. Anyway, do you guys see that flying metal ball up there in the air? It's going to circle around that area for a while, and then it should come down to do a quick patrol of that alley over there. That's where we'll have our talk. As long as we get there without being noticed, we shouldn't have much trouble. Let's go."

We manage to make our way into the alley that Breynan mentioned pretty easily, thanks to the general lack of guards in this area, and then we wait patiently for the 'droon' to come down to us. After about two minutes of circling around in the sky, the metal ball comes down, just like Breynan predicted, and it begins to hover a few feet above the ground, very close to us.

"Hey, you!" Breynan says. "Metal ball! I want to speak to the Overseer! Do you hear me?"

The metal ball turns around, so that its green eye can face Breynan directly. After a few seconds of silence, the 'droon' responds, in its usual metallic voice.

"Request acknowledged," the metal ball says. "Please stand by. The Overseer protocol will be initiated shortly."

"Overseer protocol now initiated," the metal ball says, and then the tone of its metallic voice suddenly becomes more expressive. "Hello, Breynan. How may I be of assistance to you today?"

"You know why we came here, you old rust bucket," Breynan says. "You're the one who invited us! Now tell us why you did it!"

"The Overseer protocol does not recall making such an invitation," the Overseer says. "Perhaps you are confused. If you are willing to tell me which event you were invited to, I would be more than happy to lead you to the correct location."

"Looks like he's playing dumb again," Melindra says.

"Or maybe he's telling us that we're not the ones he invited here, and that he's only willing to speak to the official representatives of the king of the underground," Kate says.

 "That's not what he's saying," Breynan tells us. "Don't worry, he'll give us the info we need eventually. You just have to find the right questions. Hey, Overseer! Have there been any changes to the palace's security lately? Perhaps the kind of changes that could allow a group of rebels to sneak in unnoticed?"
"There have been no such changes made recently," the Overseer says. "The palace is as secure as it's always been."

"Well, maybe the situation inside the castle has changed, then," Breynan says. "Is the king of Ollendor showing signs of having contracted a sickness, by any chance?"

"The king is in perfect health," the Overseer says. "Thank you for asking."

"What about the situation regarding the newest addition to the king's entourage?" Kate says. "How is Eiden getting along with the royal guards?"

The Overseer makes a short pause before he answers Kate's question.

 "Most of the royal guards do not accept Eiden as a figure of authority, and they view him as a threat," the Overseer says. "Eiden seems to be aware of this, and he is constantly trying to provoke them, in order to see their reactions."
"That does sound like Eiden," Melindra says.

"Is there any way in which we rebels could benefit from this friction between the royal guards and the Creator?" Breynan says. "Perhaps the constant tension between them is causing a blind spot of some sort that could be exploited by us when invading the castle?"

"As has been previously stated, there have been no changes recently that could affect the security of the palace," the Overseer says.

 "Does anyone else have any questions for the Overseer?" Breynan says.
"I don't know if there's any use in interrogating him further," Kate says. "It seems to me that he already told us all the information he had regarding the king of Ollendor's weaknesses."

"I think so too," Breynan says. "Maybe we should get ready to head back, then. Alright, Overseer, that will be all for today. Have a safe trip."

"Goodbye, Breynan," the Overseer says, and then the metal ball flies into the air once more, in order to continue its patrols.

"Let's go this way," Breynan says, and then he heads back the way we came.

 "So, can we know for sure that anything of what the Overseer told us is true?" I say, as we're all moving towards the exit.
"Not yet, but we should be able to easily verify all this information," Breynan says. "As soon as we get back to our base, we can start by--"

Breynan suddenly interrupts himself, because right before we reach the end of the alley, three men dressed in rags place themselves in front of us, while holding daggers in their hands.

"You know what conversation I'm talking about..." I say. "It's the one where Eiden kept questioning you about your true motives. Right at the end, Eiden asked you what you were truly after, and then you cut him off by giving him an automated answer. Why did you stop the discussion there?"

 She then begins to lift us all into the air very slowly, but one of the men in rags starts running towards us and he tries to attack Melindra.
"No, I won't let you get away!" the man says, but he is intercepted by Breynan, who pulls his sword out and clashes with him.

At the same time, the two other men also come running towards us, while Leila and I are forced to pull out or weapons and engage them as well.

"I can't focus on lifting you if you're all fighting!" Melindra says, as we are all being lowered back to the ground. "Finish your fights quickly, so we can get out of here!"

While Melindra was talking, three more men were entering the alley from the other side, and it seems that they're now trying to flank us. It looks like I can't afford to hesitate anymore. I'll need to decide what to do about these men, and quick.

 "We can't!" says one of the men, in a trembling voice. "The man in black robes told us that we need to make sure you don't leave the alley. He said he'll kill our families if we don't listen to him. We can't let you pass!"
"You don't have to do this!" Breynan says, as he tries to slowly approach him. "Come with us, and we'll shelter you and your families in the underground tunnels below the city. I am with the rebels. I can keep them safe!"

"Stay back!" the man with the trembling voice says, as he swings his dagger towards Breynan. "Don't come any closer! I'm warning you!"

"We don't have time for this," Kate says, and then she conjures several tall bars of ice between us and the men in rags, in order to block them from reaching us.

"What are you doing?" Breynan says. "Now they have us right where they want us."

"No, they don't," Kate says, as she's now conjuring an ice platform right below our feet. "If we can't get past them, then we'll just need to fly over them."

 Before the ice platform even has the chance to raise us from the ground, both the ice bars and the platform suddenly disappear, and Kate presses her hands against her forehead, apparently trying to suppress a severe headache.
"What happened?" I ask her.

"I don't know..." Kate says, as she is keeping her eyes closed, still trying to get rid of her headache. "I can't... concentrate... Barely able to... form sentences."

"She's been hit with a really powerful dizziness spell," Melindra says. "It blew right past her magical protections. I don't get it. There are no mages in the vicinity. Who could have cast this spell?"

"It must be someone using a lessathi device," Breynan says. "Maybe even a royal guard. Not all of them are mages."

"If they're not a mage, then I have no way of distinguishing them from every other civilian around our area!" Melindra says. "We shouldn't have let our guard down. I'm taking us out of here."

 "Let's get out of here before anyone else tries to attack us," Breynan tells us, as soon as he finishes casting his healing spell.
We walk past the father and the boy and we make our way out of the alley, while carefully checking our surroundings to see if there isn't another ambush waiting for us on the larger street right outside. As we make our way back towards the place where we first got teleported, we catch a glimpse of a woman heading into the alley we just left, who is likely the 'mother' that the man I shot mentioned earlier.

 Just from a glance, I can tell that these men have never held a blade before in their lives. Even without my stats, I should be able to deal with them easily.
I waste no time and I use my dagger to stab the man in front of me in the leg. I then kick him in the stomach and make him fall on his back, as I quickly pull the crossbow out of my backpack and begin shooting the men behind me in their legs as well, in order to immobilize them.

Just as the three men who were trying to flank us are falling to the ground, the man that I stabbed earlier recovers much faster than I anticipated, and he immediately dashes at me with his knife held firmly in his hands.

I quickly shoot him in the other leg, in order to try and slow his momentum, but before he falls to the ground, the man still manages to stab me in the left side of my abdomen. 

"Looks like you could use some healing," Breynan tells me, as I am pressing my hand against my wound in order to stop it from bleeding too hard, while the man that stabbed me is screaming in pain on the ground, unable to get back up.

 As I take a look towards Breynan, I see that both he and Leila have managed to knock out their adversaries, and they are now approaching me. When Breynan gets close enough to me, he puts his hands on my wound and then a white light comes out of them, while I'm beginning to slowly feel the pain going away thanks to the effects of the healing.
"Father!" a ten year old boy shouts, as he is now running towards the man that stabbed me, who is still lying on the ground.

"I'm alright," the man says, when the boy reaches him. "Please, go back to your mother. It's not safe here."

"But father, we need to take you to a doctor!" the boy says. "You are bleeding!"

 "I will never forgive you..." the boy says, while gripping the clothes of the dead body in front of him even harder than before.
He then says the same words in a much louder voice, as the look in his eyes now turns into one full of hatred.

"I will never forgive you!" the boy shouts.

"This way," Breynan tells me, when he sees that I've stopped moving.

I take one last look at the boy, and then I follow Breyan out of the alley, without turning back. When we exit the alleyway, I catch a glimpse of a woman right outside, covering her eyes with one of her hands, while tears are slowly running down her face. I quickly realize that she must be the wife of the man I just killed. We all walk right past her without saying a word, and we begin heading back towards the place where we first got teleported.

Just as the three men who were trying to flank us are falling to the ground, the man that I stabbed earlier recovers much faster than I anticipated, and he immediately dashes at me with his knife held firmly in his hands.

I quickly realize that simply shooting him in the leg will not prevent me from getting stabbed, so I panic, and I use my crossbow to fire a bolt straight into the man's chest. Upon getting shot, my attacker drops his dagger and he tries to pull the crossbow bolt out with his bare hands, but he quickly loses the strength from both his arms and legs and he falls flat on the ground. After failing to get back up a few times, the man in rags finally stops moving and he slowly succumbs to his death. As I take a look around, I see that both Breynan and Leila have managed to knock out their adversaries, and they are now approaching me.

 "We need to get out of here before anyone else tries to attack us," Breynan says. "I don't want any more innocent lives to be lost today--"
"Father?..." we hear the voice of a ten year old boy, as he is now entering the alley.

When he sees the dead man lying at my feet, the boy rushes towards him as fast as he can, and then he places himself on his knees beside him, trying to wake him up.

"No..." the boy says, as he sees the lifeless gaze in his father's eyes. "No, no, no, you can't be dead. You said everything would be fine. You said we'd be going back home together after all this was over. Please, tell me that you're just sleeping. Please..."

The boy then grips his father's shirt tightly with both hands, as he is trying very hard to hold back his tears.

"Let's go," Breynan tells us. "There's nothing else we can do here."

"You..." the boy says, just as we are about to move past him. "You did this..."

When I turn my head back towards him, I see that the boy is now looking directly into my eyes, with a pained but determined look on his face. As he keeps staring at me, I suddenly realize that I am still holding the crossbow that fired the bolt which is now lodged in his father's chest.

Just as the three men who were trying to flank us are falling to the ground, the man that I stabbed earlier recovers much faster than I anticipated, and he immediately dashes at me with his knife held firmly in his hands.

 "That's why you'll always remain a trainee, Derek," the first man says. "You're never going to become a full-time royal guard if you keep waiting for the captain to come and clean up your mess."
When the three men get close enough for us to see what they look like, I realize that they are all wearing the same type of blue-colored uniforms as Gontrok and the other royal guards, except for the fact that their uniforms have much fewer markings on them, likely as a result of being only trainees. Each one of them is holding a different weapon in his hands, and each of their weapons has a different colored gem embedded into its hilt. 

The man behind us has a trident with a brown topaz embedded into it, the man on the rooftop is holding a sword with a diamond in its hilt, and the man who made the wall of fire is wearing a metal glove decorated with a ruby. It doesn't take me long to realize that their weapons are in fact lessathi-made artifacts, and that these are the kinds of tools they are using to cast all of their spells.

"None of them are mages..." Melindra tells us in a low voice, while the three men are still talking amongst themselves. "I could sense their auras from afar, but I had no idea that they were royal guard trainees... Kate, can you fight?"

"I... don't know..." Kate says, as she's still struggling to get rid of her headache. "But I'll have to try."

 "We have to find a place where we can calm down, so we can teleport back to our base," Breynan says, as we are now quickly moving through a large empty street with many alleyway entrances on its sides. "For now, let's try to get as far away from here as possible."
"We still haven't figured out who cast the dizziness spell on Kate," Melindra says. "As long as they are still around, we're not safe."

"We don't need to be safe," Breynan says. "We just need to be calm enough for the teleporter to be able to lock onto our auras."

"Okay," Melindra says. "In that case, I could try to fly us all away from here, so we can--"

"No, we can't risk flying," Breynan says. "The metal balls patrolling the skies will begin attacking us as soon as you do that. Their orders are to prioritize aerial targets above all else."

"Well, we can't risk a fight with the guards either!" Melindra says. "Kate is still unable to concentrate on her spells, I can't attack any of the locals, and Barry's stat device is not working. Do you seriously think that you and Leila will be able to hold off the royal guards all by yourselves?"

"As long as we can get far enough away from here, there will be no need for a fight," Breynan says. "We just need to reach the end of this street, and then we can--"

 "Watch out!" Melindra shouts and then she quickly pulls Breynan back, with both her hands.
There is a sudden blast of fire coming from one of the alleys on the side of the street, and then the whole area in front of us gets immediately engulfed in flames. The large wall of fire that now blocks our path is apparently only inches away from Breynan's face. Had Melindra not pulled him away in time, he would have likely been completely incinerated.

"You missed," I hear a man's voice, as he is making his way out of an alley behind us. "I can't believe you actually missed. Could you not wait for another second until you cast that spell?"

"It's not my damn fault," I hear another man's voice, coming from the alley where the wall of fire originated from. "That wench stopped them right before they were about to enter my line of sight. It doesn't matter, though. They've got a huge wall of fire in front of them now. They're not going anywhere."

"I told you both that engaging them by ourselves would be a stupid idea," says another man, who is apparently situated on the rooftop of a weirdly shaped building on the side of the street. "We are only trainees. We should have waited for the real royal guards to come and back us up."

 Just as she's about to reach her target so she can stab him from behind, the man with the trident turns towards her instantly with a malicious grin on his face, and he once again sticks his trident into the flat rocks below his feet. Before she gets the time to react, a huge fist made of stone suddenly comes out of the ground and it punches Leila so hard that it sends her flying on her back, causing her to hit her head on the pavement and to lose her consciousness.
"Did you really think I was so stupid as to not realize that those manticores were illusions?" the man with the trident says as he removes his weapon from the ground, while the large stone fist crumbles into pieces like the wall from before. "I was just waiting for one of you to be dumb enough to enter the range of my rock fist attack. Say goodbye to your friend."

He then tries to advance towards Leila, but he hits what appears to be an invisible barrier, which is blocking his path.

"What the hell?..." the man with the trident says, as he is placing his hands on the barrier, trying to see how far it stretches.

While the royal guard trainee is still trying to get around the invisible wall, I suddenly feel Melindra's air currents flowing all around my body.

"Bring her back here!" Melindra tells me as she is pointing towards Leila, who is still lying unconscious on the ground. "Quick! I can't hold this wind barrier for much longer."

 "I didn't spend two whole years mastering this weapon just so I could act as a glorified lookout," the first man says. "Today, I'm going to show all of the royal guards what I am capable of, and you two are going to help me!"
"Not like we have much of a choice at this point," Derek says. "Let's get this over with."

"Get ready!" Breynan tells us.

Kate does not wait for the men to attack, and she sends several icicles towards the guy behind us. The trainee quickly thrusts his trident into the ground, and a wall of rock raises itself from the pavement in front of him, blocking all of the projectiles that were about to hit him. The man then raises his trident from the ground, and the wall crumbles to pieces. 

At the same time, the man on the rooftop raises his sword, and he begins to slowly lift himself in the air, while the man in front of us points his glove in our direction, and a beam of fire comes out of it, heading straight for our group.

Kate immediately makes a wall of ice in front of us which shields us from the flames, but as soon as the fire is gone, the wall quickly disappears and Kate puts her hand on her forehead, trying once again to suppress the effects of her headache. All of a sudden, Breynan hits the ground with his staff, and a very bright white light fills the area next to us. When the light disappears, we see that three manticores have now appeared out of nowhere and that they are already taking to the air, each of them heading for a different target.

 "Damn it!" the man with the trident says, as he sees one of the winged lions quickly approaching him. "I didn't know they had a summoner!"
"Take down the summons!" Derek, the man with the sword says, in a panicky voice, when he sees one of the manticores flying towards him. "Quick! I can't outmaneuver a manticore while I'm in the air."

"Then get back on the ground and fight it!" the man with the trident says, as he is trying to shoot down the manticore closest to him with rock projectiles. "I already have my hands full, here!"

The man with the metal glove does not say anything, but he is constantly sending blasts of fire towards the manticore above him, even though he can't seem to hit it even once.

"I'll try to take one of them down while they're distracted," Leila writes, and then she rushes towards the man with the trident.

"No, wait!" Melindra shouts, but Leila doesn't hear her, and she keeps pressing forward.

 "I'm on it!" I say, and then I fly up high in the sky, in order to make sure that I can get over Melindra's invisible barrier so that I can start shooting at the man with the trident.
As I get past the barrier, I position myself somewhere above the royal guard trainee, and I begin firing my crossbow in his direction. Unfortunately, the man anticipates my shots and he manages to get out of the way in time, while he also prepares a counter attack by using his weapon to create a few boulders out of thin air. When he's done making his rock projectiles, he points his trident towards me and he sends all of his boulders flying at me with great speed.

I dodge the projectiles easily in mid-air and then I shoot a few more crossbow bolts at him, but this time the man doesn't even bother to step aside and he just conjures a wall of rock to block them.

"Stop wasting your time with him and grab Leila!"  Melindra shouts, as I am reloading my crossbow. "The 'droons' are going to notice you! Damn it, they're already coming down!"

When I hear what Melindra is saying, I look up and I see that there are now six red-eyed metal balls that are quickly heading towards me. I attempt to shoot them from a distance, but they dodge my attacks without much effort and then they continue to advance in my direction. In the meantime, the man with the trident takes advantage of this situation and he begins to send even more boulders my way, so he can keep me distracted.

 As I am busy dodging boulders in mid-air while reloading my crossbow, I suddenly get a strong headache and a feeling of intense disorientation, which causes me to stop moving and to grab my forehead with both hands, in an attempt to make the pain go away.
I quickly realize that this must be a spell similar to the one that was cast on Kate, and that the only thing I can do is to endure it. While I am struggling to regain my balance, a boulder comes out of nowhere and it hits me right in the head, cracking my skull open and killing me on the spot.

 "As if I would be stupid enough to risk getting mauled to death just based on your intuition," Derek says, as he's still flying in the air, while swinging his sword in order to send powerful blasts of wind towards the manticore that is chasing him. "If you really think that these are illusions, then prove it!"
"Have you never seen a manticore before in your life?" the man with the trident says. "Can you not see that their movements are unnatural? Actually, you know what? Never mind that. Just look at the manticore I was fighting. All this time it could have attacked me, but ever since I called it an illusion, it completely stopped trying to dive for me and now it's just circling the skies. Do you think that's a coincidence?"

"I can't--" Derek starts to say but he gets interrupted.

"Also, didn't you notice that the red-eyed metal balls aren't attacking them?" the man with the trident says. "Why would they ignore such big flying unidentified targets unless they knew that they were illusions?"

"Okay, you've convinced me," says the man with the metal glove and then he stops trying to dodge, just as one of the manticores was diving for him.

Seeing that he is no longer trying to evade its attacks, the manticore suddenly flaps its wings and it soars right back into the sky, as it begins to circle around aimlessly just like the manticore that was fighting the man with the trident before.

 "I'm on it!" I say, and then I fly up high in the sky, in order to make sure that I can get over Melindra's invisible barrier so that I can start shooting at the man with the trident.

In the meantime, the man with the trident takes advantage of this situation and he begins to send even more boulders my way, so he can keep me distracted.

 As I am busy dodging boulders in mid-air while reloading my crossbow, I suddenly get a light headache and a slight feeling of nausea. I quickly realize that this must be happening because the same person who cast the dizziness spell on Kate earlier used a similar, but weaker version of the spell on me to make me lose my balance. Luckily, I still have the magical protection against dizziness that Illuna cast on me a week ago, so the effects of the spell are not too severe.
I continue to dodge the incoming boulders successfully, despite the minor headache, and I manage to shoot down two of the metal balls before they reach me. As soon as the 'droons' get closer to me, however, they immediately begin to attack me with fire and ice beams, which forces me to distance myself from them while still being cautious of the rock projectiles coming from below.

All of a sudden, four icicles penetrate the remaining metal balls, which get sent crashing down to the ground while Kate is gesturing at me to come back down. I decide to take her advice and to get back to a lower altitude before any more 'droons' have the time to spot me. On my way back, I also grab Leila in my arms and I fly with her towards Melindra and Kate, while the royal guard trainee begins to shout furiously at his teammates.

"What are you two doing?!" the man with the trident says. "Why are you still fighting those manticore illusions? Don't you understand that they're not real? Just stop moving around and let them hit you!"

 "I'm on it!" I say, and then I fly as fast as I can towards Leila, at a relatively low altitude.
The man with the trident sees what I'm doing and he tries to shoot a few rock projectiles my way, but they are all blocked by Melindra's wind barrier, so I manage to reach my destination unharmed. While I'm grabbing Leila in my arms, the trainee tries once again to attack me by sticking his trident into the ground to create a stone fist, but since he can't conjure it close enough to me, all the fist does is punch the empty air in front of it. 

Seeing that I am in no danger of being hit, I decide to just ignore my adversary's attacks and to carry Leila back to our group, while the man with the trident gives up on trying to stop me and begins venting his anger at his teammates instead.

 "Well, I'll be damned..." Derek says, as he now also stops moving, which makes the third manticore distance itself from him as well. "These rebels did a really good job at making a fool out of me, didn't they? I guess it's time to teach them a lesson."
"Great..." Melindra says as she creates a large, semi-transparent barrier all around us. "Kate, how's the headache going? Is there any chance you could make an ice dome around us?"

"Even if I could make one, there's no way I could hold it for more than a second in my current state," Kate says, as she is massaging her forehead. "I'm sorry."

"Yeah, I kind of figured as much, but it was worth a shot," Melindra says, as her barrier begins to get bombarded with fire, wind and earth attacks from all directions.

After about ten seconds of the barrier being under siege, Melindra is already giving signs of fatigue, and I can see a drop of sweat running down the side of her face.

 "Melindra, you've done enough," Kate says, all of a sudden. "If you force yourself to hold the barrier any longer than this, you might lose control of your powers again and risk dying because of the enchanter's oath. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have made any of you follow me here. Please, just get away from here while you still can, and take Leila with you. If you and Barry try to fly away with her now, you might still make it."
"Nonsense," Melindra says. "All I'm doing right now is reinforcing the air around us. There's no reason why it would backfire in any way, even if I lose control over it."

She then raises her voice, so that everyone in the area can hear her.

"Still, it would help out a lot if SOMEONE would finish casting their spell already," Melindra says. "Seriously, how much longer are you planning to make me wait, anyway?"

"What is she talking about?" Derek says.

 "Who cares?" the man with the trident says. "She's probably just bluffing. If they had another ally here with them, we would have known by now, so we shouldn't--"
The man interrupts himself all of a sudden, when he looks above and sees three immense serpents made of water, flying through the air while quickly approaching him and his allies. The serpents each have a length of at least one hundred feet, a width of about six feet, and they have a ferocious look about them that makes it seem as if they were thirsting for blood.

"Dear gods..." the man with the trident says. "Retreat! Retreat right now or we're done for, do you understand me?"

"Aaaaaah!" Derek screams, as he flies in the opposite direction from the serpents, as fast as he can. "They're going to catch up to us! They're going to--"

Derek does not get to finish his sentence, because he is swallowed up by one of the water serpents, which then carries him far away from the battlefield. Soon afterwards, the same thing happens to both of the other royal guard trainees, who weren't fast enough to outrun the giant snake-like creatures and got swept away by the water as well.

 "Was that... Illuna's water magic?" Kate asks, as she seems to be struggling to make sense of the situation.
"It was, indeed," we hear Illuna's voice, as she stops suppressing her aura and then comes walking out of an alley on the side of our street.

Now that I can sense her aura clearly, I am noticing the fact that Flower's aura is very faint, which means that she must be sleeping.

"I thought you were never going to finish casting that spell!" Melindra tells Illuna, as she approaches our group. "You just HAD to make three serpents, didn't you?"

"I wanted there to be one for each of them, just in case," Illuna says. "It's not like I would have gotten a second chance at launching a surprise attack of this magnitude. You didn't want any of them to get away, did you?"

"Fine, fine," Melindra says. "You made your point."

"I don't understand..." Kate says. "Illuna, how did you find us?"

 "I've been following you all from a distance, since before you even teleported here," Illuna says. "Melindra likely sensed my presence from the beginning, but she was gracious enough to not give away my position. When I saw that you had gone to the surface, I asked the person in charge of the teleporter to bring me here as well, and then I continued to follow you, because I was certain that you would find a way to get yourselves into trouble."
"And that we did!" Melindra says.

"Why didn't you come and ask for my help before you teleported here?" Illuna says, with a serious look in her eyes, as she looks at Kate.

"I..." Kate says. "I didn't want to be a bother..."

Illuna shakes her head in disapproval.

"I thought we were already long past this phase of our interpersonal interaction," Illuna says. "Please tell me that we're not still at the stage where we are supposed to use small talk to communicate."

 "No..." Kate says, in a humble tone of voice. "You're right. We are not."
"Good," Illuna says. "I detest small talk."

"I'm afraid that we'll have to interrupt our chat for now," Melindra says. "I can sense the captain of the royal guard and that mercenary heading our way, and a few other mages as well. It won't be long until they reach us. Breynan, do you think we should be able to teleport back, now?"

"We're probably still going to need to wait a little, but I'll call Barry, so he can get the teleporter ready," Breynan says, as he pulls out his transceiver.

"Were those three all of the enemies in your area?" Illuna asks.

"There was one other mage who cast a dizziness spell on Kate, but we can't tell where he is," I say.

"He is likely hiding in one of the buildings on the side of the street," Melindra says. "These houses are full of civilians, so there's no way for me to figure out who our attacker is, given that he's not a mage."

 "But you know what happened to Desmond!" the teleporter guy says. "I can't risk it!"
"We'll all be dead if you don't get us out of here, do you understand?" Breynan says. "This is not the time to be worrying about getting a little headache!"

"You know full well that it's more than just a headache!" the teleporter guy says. "And besides, what if this time it's even worse? What if you lose an arm or a leg? Are you willing to risk that?"

"Now you're just exaggerating!" Breynan says. "Listen, we really don't have time to argue about--"

Before Breynan gets to finish his sentence, a man dressed in black robes teleports right behind Illuna out of the blue, and he attempts to stab her in her heart with a knife. Illuna notices him in the last second and she manages to avoid a fatal blow, but unfortunately this does not stop the man from running his dagger through her chest, as we're all witnessing the scene with horrified looks on our faces.

"No!" Kate shouts, as she shoots several icicles towards the man in black robes, forcing him to jump back. "Get away from her!"

 Once the black-robed man removes his knife, Illuna falls to the ground and it seems as if she's about to faint, while a puddle of blood is slowly being formed on the pavement below her. As I take a better look at the man who attacked Illuna, I see that he is wearing quite a few rings on his fingers, with different-colored gemstones embedded into them. It looks like these rings are lessathi relics that are being used to cast various types of magic, because the man is now creating a sword out of thin air and sending it flying towards Kate.
"Breynan, heal her quick!" Kate says in a desperate tone of voice, as she is trying to hold the man in black robes at bay, while suppressing her headache.

"W-w-what's going on?" the teleporter guy says through the transceiver, as Breynan rushes to heal Illuna.

"Everyone listen to me!" Melindra shouts all of a sudden, while Breynan is busy casting a healing spell on Illuna. "We need to get out of here now! Gontrok is on his way here, and he's traveling at a ridiculous speed. At this rate, he will be here any moment!"

"Did you hear that, Barry?" Breynan says, through his transceiver. "We need you to teleport us right now!"

"But, the rules... I can't--" the teleporter guy says.

"Never mind the rules!" Breynan says, in a loud voice. "I'll take full responsibility. Now teleport us, quick! We don't have time."

"Gontrok is almost here!" Melindra says.

 "Alright!" the teleporter guy shouts, in a panicky voice. "I'll do it! But don't blame me for what happens!"
A bright white light begins to envelop us all, as our bodies are vibrating loudly. Just as we're about to get teleported, I catch a glimpse of Gontrok making his way towards us at a very high speed.

"Damn it!" I hear him shout, and then my body is transported away from the street that we were on.

Just like Breynan warned us, the feeling I'm getting right now is that of my whole body being torn to shreds. It takes all of my willpower to not lose my consciousness while being teleported, and once I finally reach my destination, the first thing I do is to vomit on the ground.

As I slowly recover, I take a quick look around, and I see that although we are in an underground cavern surrounded with seredium walls, there is no teleporter device in sight, and despite having explored the rebel base all day, this tunnel does not seem familiar to me at all. As Breynan is still struggling to keep Illuna alive with one of his healing spells, I begin to finally understand what happened to us, and I ask everyone a question.

"This..." I say. "This isn't anywhere near the underground rebel base, is it?"

"Umm yes..." I say, as I tap on my transceiver through my pocket. "Yes, to both your previous questions, but how did you--"

"Illuna, I just saw a premonition!" Rose shouts. "Someone's going to teleport behind you! Move away from there, quick!"

"A premonition?..." I say. "Wait, since when can you see--"

Before I get to finish my sentence, a man dressed in black robes appears out of nowhere, right behind Illuna, and he attempts to stab her in her heart with a knife. Thanks to Rose's warning, Illuna manages to jump away and to escape with only a light cut on the side of her waist, but her attacker does not give up and he tries to get close to her once again.

"No!" Kate shouts, as she sends several ice cones towards the black-robed man, forcing him to step back. "Stay away from her!"

As I look at our attacker, I notice that he is wearing quite a few rings on his fingers, with different-colored gemstones embedded into them. Something tells me that these rings are lessathi relics that can be used to cast various types of magic. I need to tell the others about this.
