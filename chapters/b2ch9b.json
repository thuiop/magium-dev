        "text": " \"Oh, they were a lot more than just two allies,\" Melindra says. \"Why, six hundred years ago, they were nearly inseparable. You would have almost thought that they were a couple by looking at them, except for the fact that one of them was a human, and the other was a spirit fox from the magical plane.\"<br/>Inseparable, huh? Well, I guess this explains why Eiden got so angry when I suggested that he destroyed the city of Olmnar because he was seeking the fox's forgiveness...<br/><br/>\"Huh...\" Hadrik says. \"Well, the more you know...\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, Melindra, you still haven't told them the funniest part!\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"What are you talking about?\" Melindra asks Arraka, in a cold tone.<br/><br/>\"I'm talking about how the fox has been confined to her sacred forests for decades, because of her spat with Eiden!\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>\"Why?\" Daren asks. \"Did Eiden lock her inside with a spell?\"<br/><br/>\"It's not because of Eiden,\" Melindra says. \"It's because of the dragon, Tyrath. Whenever she leaves her sacred forests, the fox loses most of her powers. The dragon knows this, and he would immediately seize the opportunity to kill her, as soon as she stepped out of her realm.\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah,\" Arraka says, \"but back when the fox and Eiden were still buddies, Tyrath would not dare to attack the fox, even when she left the sacred forests, because he knew that Eiden would immediately teleport to her aid, since he could sense them both from all the way across the continent.\"<br/>\"Wait,\" I say. \"That's the only reason why the dragon hasn't attacked the fox while she was outside her sacred forests? Because of Eiden? Couldn't he just... send some of his elite squads to fight Eiden, and kill the fox while he was distracted, or something?\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Melindra says. \"Definitely not. Eiden would never get distracted from watching over the fox by a few mooks. She's much too important to him. If you wanted to distract Eiden from the fox, you'd need to bring a whole army to fight him. Or a god.\"<br/><br/>\"Hold on a sec,\" Hadrik says. \"Didn't the fox, the dragon and Eiden all have some pact which prevented them from fighting each other? Why would the dragon try to break that pact by killing the fox, when he'd know that it would lead to a direct confrontation with Eiden?\"<br/><br/> \"Because it would be too good of an opportunity to pass up!\" Arraka says. \"And one of the main reasons why the dragon agreed to make this pact in the first place was because he knew that Eiden and the fox were allies, and he didn't want to risk fighting them both at once. Starting a fight with Eiden would be a small price to pay for ridding himself of the fox, especially since he is under the delusion that he could defeat Eiden without destroying the whole continent in the process, if he tried hard enough.\"<br/>\"And you don't think he could?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"Of course he couldn't,\" Arraka says. \"Tyrath would not stand a chance against Eiden if he went all out. Do you remember when Eiden revealed his aura in the arena, and I said that he was finally getting a little bit serious? Well, I wasn't joking that time. Eiden is much more powerful than he lets on. I would know. I fought him in the still winter. He could probably fight the dragon on equal terms even without his tricks. But with his tricks? He would probably destroy him without blinking.\"<br/><br/>",

Once Flower and I are far enough, Melindra unleashes a very powerful blast of air that scatters away all of the smoke, giving us a clear view of the flaming forest ahead of us. As soon as she gets within range, Illuna shoots a very powerful jet of water out of her hands, and she uses it to extinguish the flames from the trees in front of us, one by one.<br/><br/>\"The fires are out,\" Flower says. \"Let's move!\"<br/><br/>After we move past the flaming trees, it does not take us long until we manage to find the three animals, by detecting their auras. As soon as we reach them, the two wolves both turn to face us, while growling and baring their fangs at us menacingly, and the bear is raising himself upright on his hind legs, in order to look more intimidating.<br/><br/>",

After a few hours of walking, we decided to set up camp earlier today, because the sky still hadn't cleared up entirely, and we wanted to make sure that we'd catch some sleep before a new storm would rear its ugly head to blow away all of our tents.<br/>Before going to sleep, Hadrik insisted that we all join him in another card game that he learned from dwarven taverns. While I managed to use my notebook research as an excuse to not participate, the others weren't so lucky. It seemed that the ones he wanted the most to participate in the game were Kate and Melindra, because they both tried to refuse him several times, but Hadrik would have none of it. <br/><br/> It was pretty obvious what he was trying to do. His true purpose was likely to create a scenario in which Kate and Melindra would be forced to interact with each other, in the hopes that they would start to get along better. Everyone probably knew this fact as well as I did, but Hadrik is pretty hard to refuse once he sets his mind to do something, so they all had to reluctantly agree to join his game, eventually.<br/>After about fifteen minutes of sitting on the grass, reading from my notebook, I suddenly see a blue message floating in front of my eyes.<br/><br/>\"Still busy with your notebook?\" Leila writes.<br/><br/>\"Yeah,\" I say, as I raise my eyes to look at her. \"Those loopholes aren't going to find themselves. Weren't you playing Hadrik's card game just now?\"<br/><br/>\"I was,\" Leila writes, \"but the game requires us to call out the names of the cards as fast as we can, and my written messages don't form themselves instantly, so I had too much of a disadvantage, compared to the others. May I have a seat?\" <br/><br/>\"Of course,\" I tell her, as Leila sits herself on the grass, next to me.<br/><br/>",

I was just walking around the house, when I noticed that everything around me was completely frozen. I tried calling out to my siblings, but they wouldn't answer, they wouldn't breathe, they were just standing there, looking straight ahead, while even the leaves falling from the trees were floating in mid-air, completely frozen. And there was nothing I could do. The time eventually got unfrozen by itself, but I have no idea why, and no idea if this might happen again. I can only assume that I somehow activated my time powers by mistake, but I had absolutely no control over them. I'm really scared that the next time this happens, I might not be able to undo the spell, and I'll just get trapped like this forever, in a world where everyone is frozen in time, except for me...\"<br/>\"Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that,\" Melindra says, all of a sudden.<br/><br/>\"What?...\" Daren says. \"What do you mean? Why shouldn't she?\"<br/><br/>\"Because no time-freezing spell lasts forever,\" Melindra says. \"No matter how long it takes, the spell would still need to end at some point. But if you don't feel like waiting, and you don't have any direct way of cancelling the spell, you could always try to physically interact with some of the people who are frozen in time. There is one thing that all of the time-freezing spells have in common, and it's that you can't physically interact with any living beings that are frozen in time without triggering the cancellation of your spell.\"<br/><br/><% } %>",

By the feel of his aura, I'd say that he is most definitely one of the stronger mages that have joined this tournament. Once we get a good look at him, we see that he is a dark-skinned man, in his late fifties, with short, gray hair, a muscular physique, and a stern, unforgiving look in his eyes. He is wielding two large swords in his hands, and he is wearing leather armor that appears to be heavily enchanted. The man walks slowly until he reaches Hadrik and me, and then he stops right in front of us, with a rather calm expression on his face.<br/>\"May I ask if this is the camp where Daren, the healer in armor resides?\" the man says. \"If so, then I would very much like to meet him.\"<br/><br/> \"I think you already know the answer to that question,\" Hadrik says. \"But before we let you go any further, I'm afraid that you're first going to have to introduce yourself. Tell us... who are you and how do you know Daren?\"<br/>\"I am surprised that Daren hasn't told you about me,\" the man says. \"We've known each other for a long time. We are very old friends.\"<br/><br/>\"That still doesn't answer the question,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>The man smiles.<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" he says. \"In that case, I will introduce myself. My name is Nolderan. I am an ex-sage, a renowned enchanter, and a martial arts master. And also, I am the man who gave Daren his scar.\"<br/><br/>",
