Our mages did all they could to preserve the body with their spells, but it has been more than a week since his death, so you should be warned that the sight of him will be a bit shocking...\"<br/>\"How did this happen?\" the king asks, with the same calm voice.<br/><br/>\"He was... attacked in the middle of the street by some tournament participants,\" the ambassador says. \"The earl... fought valiantly for his life, but the mages used cowardly tactics to--\"<br/><br/>\"Some tournament participants did this?\" the king asks. \"How is this possible? Why haven't they been sent back to their own continents by the spell that prevents them from hurting the people of Varathia?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, I am interested to know this as well!\" Eiden says. \"Tell us, ambassador, how were those villainous mages able to bypass such a reliable and non-exploitable protection spell?\"<br/><br/>Even though I can't see them talking, I can easily imagine the smirk that Eiden must have on his face at this point in the conversation, as he is looking at the ambassador with his eyes closed, waiting for an answer.<br/><br/>\"Aren't you going to answer them, ambassador?\" the captain of the royal guards says, after a long pause.<br/><br/> \"We... don't know how these mages were able to bypass the protection spell,\" the ambassador says. \"However, we have reasons to believe that they are capable of harming any of the locals, without any restrictions.\"<br/>\"And these tournament participants... they were executed for their crime?\" the king asks, still in a calm tone, but you can tell that he is barely restraining himself at this point.<br/><br/>\"...No, your highness,\" the ambassador says. \"The gnome king was very opposed to the idea of executing them. Eventually we... reached a compromise and sentenced them to fight in one of the greatest arena events in our entire continent's history, but even without their magic they were somehow able to survive until the end, and so according to the laws written in the treaty between all kingdoms of Varathia, they were released on the same day that--\"<br/><br/>\"You let them go?!\" the king of Ollendor shouts so loudly that I almost had to cover my ears. \"You miserable worm, are you telling me that my brother's murderers are roaming around freely through Varathia at this very moment? I ought to chain you up and feed you to the dogs for your incompetence, you pathetic excuse for a diplomat. Is this why I sent you to Thilias? To negotiate with that idiot gnome as if he and I were equals? Why didn't you tell him that there would be war if he didn't execute those mages on the spot? You just let him walk all over you as if you were one of his lowly servants?!\"<br/><br/> \"My king, I did try to tell him that there would be war, but he wouldn't listen,\" the ambassador says, in a panicky voice. \"And besides, Golmyck was not the only one who took the side of the mages! In fact, the main reason why they were sent to the arena was because...\"<br/>The ambassador stops speaking suddenly, probably because he realized what would likely happen to him if he were to rat on Eiden in front of the king.<br/><br/>\"Because...\" the ambassador says again, in a more trembling voice.<br/><br/>I can probably imagine what the ambassador was thinking in these moments. Would it be better to be killed by the king, or by Eiden? Which one of them would be more likely to spare his life? Was mercy even something that either of those two would be capable of?<br/><br/>\"If I may interject, your highness,\" the captain of the royal guards says when he realizes that the ambassador isn't planning to finish his sentence. \"The intruders that I told you about earlier were also tournament participants, and they were more than capable of attacking me, despite being a citizen of Ollendor. The group that we fought had a fully armored, dark-skinned mage with an 'X' shaped scar on his forehead, a banshee that could use ice as a magical element, a little girl that could cast fire magic, and a giant that was shapeshifted as a dwarf. Do any of these descriptions sound familiar to you, ambassador?\"<br/><br/>\"That's them!\" the ambassador shouts. \"They are the ones who killed the earl! I'm sure of it!\"<br/><br/>",

Do you think that they are still inside the city?\"<br/>\"Most definitely, your highness,\" the captain says. \"Biliborrathrathsarran assured us that the invisible barrier he created around the city prevents anyone from teleporting past our walls using any conventional spells. The only way to get in or out of this city is through the city gates. Wherever these criminals are hiding, it must be inside the city.\"<br/><br/>\"Then it is clear what we must do...\" the king of Ollendor says, and then he takes a short pause before he speaks again. \"Captain, I want the guards to scour every inch of this city until you find these mages, starting now. I don't care if it's almost night time. Wake up every single guard that we have and tell them to look in every nook and every cranny until there is no place left to hide. If our citizens refuse to open the doors to their houses, then you can assume that they are trying to harbor criminals and you are permitted to kill them on the spot. Nobody is allowed to enter or leave the city until all of my brother's murderers are found and executed. This city is going into full lockdown and you, ambassador, are going to oversee this whole operation, together with the captain.\"<br/><br/>\"Me?...\" the ambassador asks, in a slightly fearful tone.<br/><br/> \"Yes, ambassador,\" the king says. \"I am putting you in charge of dealing with these criminals. You will be personally responsible for the results of this manhunt. I don't think I need to tell you what will happen to you if you fail to capture these mages a second time. I'm certain that your desire to right your wrongs will be more than enough motivation for you to do your job properly this time around.\"<br/>\"Yes, your majesty,\" the ambassador says. \"Of course...\"<br/><br/>\"Good,\" the king says. \"Then it's settled. I hope neither of you were hoping to sleep tonight, because I suspect that you are going to be quite busy for some time. Start making the necessary preparations. I want you two to come up with a plan of action in less than an hour. Oh, and captain... would you be so kind as to send one of the palace servants to bring Bilibo... Bilibo... the lessathi here? Tell him that it is a very urgent matter and that I am requesting his presence in the castle immediately. Surely there must be at least one of his devices that would be helpful to us in such a situation.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, my king,\" the captain says. \"I will send someone to contact him at once.\"<br/><br/> \"I will meet you both in my throne room once you are done planning everything,\" the king says. \"Do not keep me waiting.\"<br/>We then hear some footsteps getting further away from the recording devices, as the king and presumably the captain of the royal guards are walking out of the room. Once we can no longer hear the steps, Eiden addresses the ambassador in a low voice.<br/><br/>\"Aren't you glad that the guard captain interrupted you earlier, ambassador?\" Eiden says. \"Thanks to him, you didn't have to tell them about our little secret, and you all got to live to see another day! Be sure to make the most of your next few hours, ambassador. Life is short. You never know what might happen!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes... Creator,\" the ambassador says, in a very forced polite tone. \"I thank you for your wisdom.\"   <br/><br/>We then hear him leaving the room, and a little later, so does Eiden. As the conversation ends, the king of the underground puts the metal cube back in his pocket and then he looks at us to see our reaction.<br/><br/>\"Well?\" the king of the underground says, after a few more seconds. \"What did you think?\"<br/><br/>",

Have you not found it odd that someone as cautious as me would usually hold these meetings with so few of my own men to protect me?\"<br/><br/>\"I did find it a bit strange, now that you mention it,\" Daren says. \"And what I'm finding even stranger is that you have even less security now than in our last two meetings. You used to have two guards by your side before, but now you only have Peter and Albert. Why did you avoid bringing your usual two guards if you knew that today's discussion might lead to a confrontation?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, the answer to that question is quite simple,\" the king says. \"It's because they would be in our way.\"<br/><br/>All of a sudden, an invisible force from above pushes us into the ground so hard that it breaks the wooden chairs we were sitting on into pieces. I try to get up, but due to the ridiculous amount of pressure that is pushing me against the floor, I can barely move a muscle. I eventually manage to turn my head a little, and I realize that all the others except Melindra and Leila are also lying on their backs just like me, unable to move. As I continue to lie there on the ground, trying to figure out what happened, I hear Arraka bursting into laughter.<br/><br/> \"Ahahahahahahaha!\" Arraka laughs. \"I was wondering when you'd finally reveal your hidden power to them, but this is just too much. I'm dying of laughter here. Ahahahahahaha!\"<br/>\"What's the matter?\" the king of the underground asks us, ignoring Arraka. \"The test has already begun. This is the same aura manipulation technique that you were so proudly saying you could fight against as soon as you'd meet the royal guard captain again. Why don't you show me how much you've really improved?\"<br/><br/>Is the king the one doing this to us? I didn't even know he was a mage! Damn it, if only I could move my arm so that I could at least throw my dagger at him or something...<br/><br/>\"You can give up on the test at any time, you know,\" the king of the underground says, after some more time passes. \"Just admit defeat, and I will let you get back up.\"<br/><br/> \"Untangle...\" Daren says, in a barely audible voice, as he is still being pushed against the ground.<br/>\"I beg your pardon?\" the king of the underground says.<br/><br/>\"Untangle... the flow of the aura... with my mind,\" Daren says again, in a louder voice.<br/><br/>He then manages to pull out his sword from its hilt, using it to stab the air above him and then to make a quick slash to the right. As soon as he does this, the invisible force that was keeping us pinned down vanishes completely, and we all immediately get up, assuming our battle stances.<br/><br/>\"There we go,\" Arraka says. \"See? You can do it if you try.\"<br/><br/>",

Alright, you've passed the first phase of the test. Albert, you are free to commence the second phase whenever you are ready.\"<br/>\"Yes, my king,\" Albert says, and a few seconds later he completely vanishes into thin air.<br/><br/>\"What did he do?...\" Hadrik says, as he looks around the room, trying to figure out where Albert disappeared. \"Was that an invisibility spell?\"<br/><br/>\"It's more than just an invisibility spell,\" the king says. \"What Albert is using right now is an ability that only the most skilled assassins can learn. He is completely concealing his presence. Not only is he not visible to you, but you also won't be able to hear him, smell him or even feel his aura. From your point of view, he may as well not be in this room at all.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, so it's similar to Eiden's invisibility spell, then,\" I say. \"Arraka, I'm guessing you know where he is?\"<br/><br/> \"Of course I know where he is,\" Arraka says. \"But I'm not going to waste my time showing you his position just for some lousy mock battle. If you want to pass this lame test, figure it out yourselves.\"<br/>\"Well, no matter where he is,\" Hadrik says, \"he's bound to come out of invisibility to attack us at some point, so I'll just wait for the right opportunity and grab him then. I can still grab people, right? It's not like I'm attacking him or anything, so the fact that he's a local shouldn't mat-- what the?!\"<br/><br/>Hadrik suddenly tries to grab something from the empty air behind him, but nothing happens. When I try to understand what happened, I notice that Hadrik's leather armor has been pierced from behind, and that there is a bit of blood dripping from the upper side of his back.<br/><br/>\"Did he seriously just attack me while he was still invisible?!\" Hadrik says, as Peter is now moving towards one of the walls, in order to observe the fight better. \"Since when do invisibility spells work like that?\"<br/><br/>\"I told you that it's more than just a spell,\" the king says. \"His breathing, his aura control and his special orange-hilted dagger all play a role in helping him mask his presence. This is the result of years upon years of arduous training. You are taking assassins far too lightly if you think that you can simply wait for them to strike before you attack them. If this weren't a mock battle, getting backstabbed like that could have very well killed you, dwarf. Perhaps you should start taking this test a bit more seriously.\"<br/><br/>",

For example, you might not get to drink with us now, but just look at how many rocks are on the ground all around you. While the rest of us are busy with our drinking, you could be snatching up a rare rock that would put Melindra's collection to shame!\"<br/><br/>\"Nah,\" I tell Hadrik. \"The rocks from here won't be any good for them. Half of them are too small, and the other half either don't have the right shades of colors or their surfaces are too smooth. I wouldn't be surprised if Melindra already got all the rocks that they would consider valuable the very first time when we walked through this tunnel.\"<br/><br/> As all the others except Melindra are looking at me too shocked to speak, Flower lets out a loud gasp, while covering her mouth with both her hands.<br/>\"Hey, what do you know!\" Melindra says, with a smug smile as she pats me hard on the back. \"Looks like spending the entire night shift teaching you about rocks wasn't a wasted effort after all! We'll make a rock collector out of you yet!\"<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't count on it,\" I tell her.<br/><br/>\"Oh my gods!\" Flower says. \"Barry actually learned to tell which types of rocks we like to collect. I can't believe it. This is the best birthday ever!\"<br/><br/>We ended up spending the rest of the trip towards the teleporter room eating cake, drinking dwarven ale and helping Flower pick up a few rocks from the cave that she would use to start her very own collection. The time we got to celebrate Flower's birthday was short, but even so, it looked like she genuinely enjoyed it, and so did we. By the time we were done eating our cake, all of us were feeling completely refreshed, and we were now ready to begin the next chapter of our adventure.<br/><br/>",

The delay was caused by some health problems that I had back in November and December and by the extremely complicated path variation in this chapter. (the chapter has 10 achievements in total)<br/><br/>Hint: Some of the achievements in this chapter are on paths that can differ depending on how you interacted with the Overseer at the end of chapter 4 of book 3. There will also be other factors influencing the variation of the paths, like whether or not Rose is alive and whether you passed the king of the underground's test in the previous chapter or not.<br/><br/>Also, remember that every chapter in Magium can be finished without having any points invested in your stats, so if you find yourself unable to pass a stat check, try loading your last checkpoint and redoing some of your previous choices until you find the paths that require no stats.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>",
