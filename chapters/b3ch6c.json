        "text": " \"So that's what your ritual was about,\" Kate says, in a serious tone.<br/>\"Yes,\" Hadrik says, in a somewhat hesitant voice. \"To complete the trial, I had to push the boulder down that cliff just like the first time, and to kill all those innocent people again. Obviously, I didn't know this at first, and just like you guys, I thought that this was my one chance to change my mistake from the past. It took me a long while to understand what the ritual actually wanted from me. It took me even longer to realize that I had to reenact everything that happened, not just the boulder pushing, so I actually had to go down to the village and check every single house for the non-existent survivors, getting a close look at every single one of the people I've killed, including the women and children. Not exactly the best experience to have, considering how hard I've been trying to forget those faces after they've haunted my dreams for years.\"<br/><br/>\"My gods, that's horrible...\" Flower says. \"But... how did this lead to you having a fight with your parents?\"<br/><br/> \"Well, as you can imagine, when I came back to our camp after this event, I was absolutely devastated,\" Hadrik says. \"The very first thing I tried to do was to go to my camp leader in order to turn myself in, along with my friends, for the war crimes we've committed. The leader pretty much laughed in my face, telling me that our war crime rules only applied for wars with other clans of giants, not for our ongoing war with the dwarves. He also told me that those children would have probably grown up to become soldiers later anyway, so it was better to take them out while they were still young. That was the first time when I realized how differently our people would treat the concept of honor when it came to races other than giants. Obviously, I couldn't just let this go, and I tried to get justice for those dead dwarves through every means at my disposal. The other giants thought I was joking at first, but when they understood that I was being serious, they began to treat me a lot more coldly, calling me a dwarf sympathizer, and saying that I no longer had the right to call myself a warrior after taking the side of our enemy.\"<br/>\"Is that why Gontrok said your parents think you've lost your honor?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/> \"Not only because of this, but it was part of the reason, yes,\" Hadrik says. \"The other part of the reason was the fact that when I realized I couldn't get any justice for the dead dwarves by staying with my clan, I decided to go on a self-imposed exile, shapeshifting myself into a dwarf so that I could infiltrate the dwarven lands and track down the remaining relatives of the innocent civilians I killed in that village. Obviously, leaving the clan for a reason like this would pretty much guarantee that I would no longer be welcome if I ever chose to come back. This didn't matter to me, though, because all I wanted was to make things right.\"<br/>\"Did you manage to find any of those relatives, in the end?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"I did,\" Hadrik says. \"It turned out that some of the dwarves I killed that night were only visiting the village, and they left their kids behind, in their own towns. When I found out about this, I took it upon myself to raise those kids until they came of age, and I also helped out a few other kids that had been orphaned because of the war, along the years. Eventually, the war between the giants and the dwarves ended, and the kids that I helped had grown up, now having their own jobs, wives and children, but I no longer had a place to call home back in the giant nation, so I decided to remain in the dwarven lands and to continue my life shapeshifted as a dwarf.\"<br/><br/>\"Did those dwarves never find out that you were a giant?\" Melindra says.<br/><br/>",

After spending so much time in the dwarven lands I pretty much started talking, acting and drinking like any other dwarf, so the majority of them didn't really see much of a difference to begin with. The one thing that I still longed for was the fighting, though. As a giant, it was practically in my blood, and I had gotten a bit tired of having to hold back during tavern brawls so that I wouldn't kill anyone by accident. That's why I eventually started to go on adventures by myself all around the world, so that I could finally find some adversaries that would be able to provide me with a true challenge. I would always end up returning to the dwarven lands after a while, and I would go drink in their taverns some more, but even after all this time, I still never had the guts to tell them what was my initial reason for starting to shapeshift as a dwarf. Maybe one day I will tell them about that dwarven village. Maybe one day...\"<br/><br/> When Hadrik finishes his story, I realize that at some point we'd all stopped moving, and we were just standing in a circle around Hadrik, listening closely to what he had to say.<br/>\"Hadrik,\" Daren says, as he puts his hand on his shoulder. \"Could you do me a favor and pour us two glasses of dwarven ale?

        "text": " \"Actually, I used to be pretty bad at swimming too, until this one time when I was exploring a cave with an archaeology professor and we ended up trapped inside,\" I say. \"In order to reach the only other exit, we needed to swim through a long underwater section of the cave, and since both of us were rather lousy swimmers, we pretty much had to spend hours upon hours learning how to hold our breaths for long periods of time and learning how to move fast underwater. What's funny is that this was probably the easiest part of all the things we had to do to get out of that cave.\"<br/>\"Is this another one of your 'mundane' stories from back when you were doing odd jobs and travelling around the world?\" Leila writes, with a bit of a smirk.<br/><br/>\"Fine, fine, I admit it,\" I say. \"Maybe in hindsight some of these stories are not really as boring as I initially made them out to be. Now, do you want to hear the rest of the story or not?\"<br/><br/>\"I'm all ears,\" Leila writes, with a smile, as we continue to walk slowly towards her father's workshop.<br/><br/> By the time I am done telling Leila my story, we finally reach doctor Reidzek's door, and we knock on it several times to let him know we're here. Seeing that he does not answer even after I call out to him, we conclude that he must not be in his workshop right now and we decide to wait for him here.<br/>As we wait, Leila and I seat ourselves on the ground, with our backs against the door and we begin to exchange stories about our lives before the tournament. Leila tells me about her life with her father after she left the beacon, and I tell her about various things that I've seen while travelling through the Western Continent. <br/><br/>For some reason, talking with Leila like this feels really natural, as if we've known each other for a long time, and now we're just catching up with what the other's been doing since the last time we talked. Our conversation flows effortlessly from one topic to the next, making us lose track of time as we both become more and more relaxed. <br/><br/>\"It's been a while since we've had the chance to just talk and unwind like this, hasn't it?\" Leila writes, as she lazily stretches her arms over her head. \"Lately, it seems like all we've been doing during our free time is training and more training. The only moments when we actually get to loosen up somewhat are our night shifts.\"<br/><br/> \"Speak for yourself,\" I say. \"The last time when I took a night shift with Daren, he made me stand in place and spin around over and over so he could study me from all angles as part of his aura training. He even made me stand on one foot while touching my nose with both my hands. I'm not even joking!\"<br/>Leila giggles silently.<br/><br/>\"That doesn't sound that bad,\" she writes. \"At least not as bad as that one time when Kate almost gave me a heart attack during one of our night shifts by jumping up from the ground all of a sudden and killing some random birds with her icicles because she thought an enemy mage summoned them as scouts...\"<br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>\"Hey, maybe we should do a night shift together too, sometime,\" Leila writes, \"It would be a nice change of pace. And I promise that with me you won't need to worry about being told to stand on one foot and to spin in place... much.\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Doctor Reidzek's been missing for a while, and the last thing we know about him is that he went to the teleporter room to do some regular maintenance,\" Albert says. \"We tried calling both him and Barry on the transceiver, but neither of them are answering. Could you pay Barry a quick visit to see if anything is wrong? And make sure that you have your transceiver open, so you can contact us in case of an emergency.\"<br/>\"Roger that,\" Peter says. \"I'll be right back!\"<br/><br/>\"Thanks,\" Albert says. \"Oh, and Peter! Could you also keep your aura hidden while you approach the teleporter room? Just in case.\"<br/><br/>\"Understood,\" Peter says in a more serious tone, and then he heads into the tunnel leading to the teleporter room without another word.<br/><br/>\"I'm sure that doctor Reidzek is fine,\" Albert tells Leila, when he sees the anxious look on her face. \"He must have just gotten a little too caught up in his work, like always. We just need to wait until Peter reaches the teleporter room, and we'll hear from your father again.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Leila writes, looking as if she were even more anxious now than before. \"We just need to wait.\"<br/><br/>As we stand there, waiting for Peter to contact us, we see Daren coming out of the quarantine area and beginning a conversation with Desmond, who is still guarding the door.<br/><br/> \"Desmond, I'm... I'm so sorry,\" Daren says, with his head bowed down. \"There is no way for me to save your brother. His sickness is just too severe at this point. If I had gotten here a few days earlier, he may have still had a chance, but with the way things are now it's just-- he is too-- I'm sorry...\"<br/>\"It's alright,\" Desmond says, in a resigned tone. \"You don't need to beat yourself up over it. I'm sure you've done all you could. What about the others? Is there any chance that any of them will recover?\"<br/><br/>\"Half of them are already cured, including myself,\" Daren says. \"As for the other half, it is still difficult to say. This treatment works best if you catch the disease in its early stages, but if you catch it too late, the chances of survival decrease drastically. The ones in critical condition will not make it, but the ones whose symptoms are only somewhat severe may still have a chance. We will have to wait for a bit longer until we can draw some definitive conclusions.\"<br/><br/>\"Even if it's only half of them, this is still much more than we could have hoped for,\" Desmond says. \"Until today, anyone who went through that door was considered to be a dead man. Now it's possible that we might not even need to send people into quarantine anymore. You should be proud of what you've accomplished here, healer. Maybe my brother won't make it, but many families will now get to see their loved ones again after they thought them to be dead. I should be the one apologizing for having misjudged you. We are all in your debt.\"<br/><br/> \"I really am sorry about your brother,\" Daren says, looking genuinely depressed. \"I wish I could have saved everyone. The only thing I can tell you is that his final moments will be a little better now that two of the nurses have been healed of the sickness, so they will be able to spend more time caring for the patients.\"<br/>\"You've done more than enough,\" Desmond says. \"Go get some rest. You've earned it.\"<br/><br/>\"I will, soon,\" Daren says. \"Thank you.\"<br/><br/>He then begins to walk towards one of the tunnels leading out of the waiting room but when he sees Leila and me he stops to give us a short update on what he's doing.<br/><br/>\"Sorry, I don't have time to chat!\" Daren tells us from a distance. \"I need to go look for the rebels' white mages so I can teach them how to heal this sickness by themselves once I'm no longer here!\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry!\" I tell him in a loud voice. \"You go do what you need to do. We'll be here when you get back!\"<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" he says. \"See you later!\"<br/><br/>Not long after Daren leaves the room, we finally hear Peter's voice coming from Albert's transceiver, but his tone seems very alert, and he is breathing heavily, as if he were running.<br/><br/>\"Albert!\" Peter says loudly. \"Albert, are you there?!\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Albert says. \"What happened?

The look she has in her eyes immediately reminds me of the time when she almost drowned in the underground lake, while she was trying to scream, but no words were coming out of her mouth.<br/><br/>\"Leila, look at me!\" I tell her, as I grab her lightly by her shoulders. \"We're going to save your father. Together. But for now, I'm going to need you to calm down, okay? If you want to help your father you need to think clearly. Do you understand?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Leila writes, as she tries to slowly come out of her panicked state. \"Yes, I understand...\"<br/><br/>",

What I can tell, however is that the sounds are getting slightly louder with each second. They are getting closer to us. Does this mean that the waiting room will turn into a battlefield soon? What about the evacuation? What will the king of the underground do about all the civilians who will be caught in the line of fire?<br/><br/>Damn it, I shouldn't be wasting time thinking about all of this.
