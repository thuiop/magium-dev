I hear that the troll is holding members of their tribe hostage, and he's threatening to kill them unless they fight by his side. One of those tribe members is a female shaman. You don't see many of those, these days.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait did you say female shaman? So that's why she had those strange garments and markings on her face...\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean? You saw her?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, one of the cells I'm guarding has a few ogres in it. It's the one closest to the locker rooms. I'm guessing Velgos must have asked the owner to move them here, temporarily, so he can easily kill one or two of them in case the warriors misbehave.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah! Those dumb ogres don't even know that their tribe members are right under their noses. Serves them right. If they were stupid enough to get captured, then they deserve to live their lives as the troll's henchmen. I'm sure they'll both provide us with good entertainment!\"<br/><br/>The guards both laugh, and then they resume their patrols.<br/><br/>",

        "text": " I hear a horn signaling the beginning of the second round, and the gate to my division starts to slowly get raised. As I keep walking, I make sure that I advance slowly enough to give Leila the time to catch up to me.<br/>The troll is still taunting me. He must be thinking that I came here to offer him a drink. I don't think he's ever had the privilege of tasting dwarven ale before. Judging by the burning sensation that I got in my throat when I drank my first bottle with Hadrik, I'd wager that this is the strongest alcoholic beverage that money can buy. Maybe Velgos would be a little more worried if he knew what I had in this bottle.<br/><br/>\"Are you trying to bribe me, human?\" Velgos says, with a laugh. \"It's going to take more than a bottle of ale to convince me to spare your life. How about you start by kneeling before me? I want every spectator in the crowd to see how pathetic you are, before I kill you!\"<br/><br/>I stop right in front of the troll, and I smile at him, while raising my bottle. Leila is now only a few dozen feet behind me, and she's closing in, with the other members of my division not far behind her. She is holding the torch behind her back, making sure that the troll doesn't notice it.<br/><br/>\"Cheers!\" I say to the troll, while I have my bottle raised in the air.<br/><br/>\"What are you trying to--\" Velgos starts to say, but I don't let him finish his sentence.<br/><br/>I quickly grab the bottle by its neck, and I smash it into the troll's skull, covering him in dwarven ale from head to toe. The troll seems shocked, unable to understand what is going on.<br/><br/> \"Leila, now!\" I shout, as I jump back from the troll.<br/>As soon as I give the signal, Leila throws her torch at the troll, igniting the flammable liquid, and causing the troll to light up in flames. Velgos starts screaming loudly, as he attempts to extinguish the fire from his head with his bare hands. Leila makes full use of this opportunity, and she quickly dashes towards her enemy, slicing one of his shoulder pads right off his armor, with one of her enchanted daggers. The troll grabs both of his scimitars in his hands, and he tries to cut Leila in half, but she jumps back in time, avoiding his strike.<br/><br/>\"I am going to destroy you,\" the troll shouts at us. \"I will cut you into pieces so small that they won't even find enough of you to give you a proper burial!\"<br/><br/>His eyes are red with rage, as the fire covering him is slowly dying out. The marks left from the burning flames are already starting to regenerate. I suppose I should have expected that regular fire would not be enough against an enemy with such high regenerative powers. What's next, then? If I don't quickly decide what I'm going to do now, the troll won't give me any more time to react. Should I go on the offensive, or should I retreat, giving the others the time to join me?<br/><br/>",

I'm going to finish them off as quickly as possible, so I can rejoin Leila and the others.<br/><br/>Judging by the size of their clubs, no amount of reflexes are going to save me if I engage these monsters up close, due to the huge area that they can cover with a single swing. I either need to be fast enough to dash in and out of their range, or strong enough to be able to kill them before they do me in.<br/><br/>I run towards the ogre on my right, baiting him to try smashing me with his club, and once he goes for the swing, I double up my speed, and I circle around him, stabbing him multiple times in the back. The other ogre tries to help his comrade, but he avoids hitting too hard, in order to not hit his friend by accident. The monster's already slow movements are even further slowed down by his holding back, which leaves me plenty of time to make one quick dash towards him, and to stab him in the heart. As soon as the second ogre is dead, I go back to the first one, which is now lying on the ground, and I slit his throat, finishing him off.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_agility || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) >= 3) {%> <br/><br/>There's no use in prolonging this battle any further.

I either need to be fast enough to dash in and out of their range, or strong enough to be able to kill them before they do me in.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not fast enough to run circles around them without getting hit, but with my level of strength, I might just be able to pull this off.  I slowly advance towards one of the ogres, and I wait for him to attack me with his club. Once he brings his weapon down upon me, I raise my knife, holding it with both hands, and I block his strike right above my head. I then drop my knife, and I grab the club with both my hands, pulling it out of the ogre's grasp. Using my newly acquired weapon, I smash the ogre's head in before he gets the time to react, and then I move towards his friend, preparing to attack him as well. Now that I have the same range of attack as him, the monster no longer has any way to compensate for his slowness. He tries to strike me, but I'm much faster, and I manage to land a hit before he even begins his swing. One hit was all it took for me to send the ogre falling to the ground. As soon as I'm done fighting, I drop the club, and I pick my knife back up from the ground. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_agility || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) >= 3) {%> Swinging a big piece of wood might have worked against these two idiots, but that troll is going to cut through it in an instant.

Ogres are both dumb and slow. The only thing they have going for them is their size and strength. With my wits, I should be able to outmaneuver them, even if I'm weaker than them.<br/><br/>I make a rush towards the ogres, trying to anticipate which direction they'll strike at me from by paying close attention to their slow movements. I realize that one of the ogres is about to swing his club towards me, so I step out of the way and try to get out of his range. Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough, and the monster's weapon smashed my head, killing me instantly.<br/><br/><% } %>",

I just have to wait for the right opportunity, and then I can stab him from behind, right as he makes the jump.<br/><br/>I wait for Leila to begin using a flurry of attacks against her opponent, and when it looks as if the troll is about to jump, I make a quick dash forward, in order to get to stab him with my blade while he is off-balance. <br/><br/>I didn't notice it right away, but there was something different about the way he jumped back this time. It looked as if he weren't going to jump at first, and that he only decided to do it after he saw me dash towards him. Unfortunately, I realized all of this much too late. Velgos jumped back, but this time, he wasn't off-balance at all. He only pretended to be, in order to bait me, and as I tried to stab him from behind, the troll swung one of his blades towards my neck, and he beheaded me in an instant.<br/><br/><% } %>",

If the two of us close in from behind and attack him from both left and right, he won't have any place left to retreat, and Leila will be able to cut his head off easily. Better yet, we wouldn't even risk anything, since he'd be losing his head before he even gets the chance to strike back at us!\"<br/><br/>\"I... suppose that I could help out,\" the mage says. \"If it's risk-free...\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" I say, not giving him any more time to think it over. \"Let's get going, then!\"<br/><br/>I then make a rush towards the troll, and the mage is forced to follow soon afterwards, so he can catch up to me. I knew that he'd jump on the opportunity to join the fight, as soon as I'd offer him a plan without any risks. He's been acting with extreme caution ever since the first round started, but it's clear that he doesn't want to be seen as a coward. Of course he'd be more than happy to be able to prove his worth without endangering his life in any way. And my plan definitely sounds safe enough... at least in the way I presented it.<br/><br/> The fact of the matter is that I've omitted one small detail when I gave him the briefing. While the troll will definitely not get the chance to harm us before he gets his head cut off, depending on how much this next beheading is going to affect him, he may well have enough energy left in him to attack  us, even without his head on his shoulders. That is exactly why I'm not going to stab the troll at all, and let the mage do all the work. As for the mage's own safety... I'm sure that he'll find a way to handle himself. Probably.<br/>We both manage to get behind the troll, while Leila is keeping him busy, and when we are in attack range, I nod to the mage, and we both dash towards our enemy, from opposite sides. Just as I reach Velgos, I jump backwards, without attacking him in any way, and I let the mage stab him by himself. The mage looks shocked at my betrayal, but he doesn't have much time to react, because one of the troll's scimitars is already being swung towards him. Leila immediately takes advantage of the distraction, and she cuts the troll's head off in the blink of an eye. This makes Velgos stop his attack mid-swing, which gives the mage the time to remove his dagger from the troll's body, and to jump backwards, as far away as he can. Just like last time, Leila throws the head to the ground, and she crushes it beneath her sandal.<br/><br/>",

Instead, a new head forms from the troll's neck, taking him only about five seconds to fully regenerate it to its original form. However, judging by the expression that he now has on his face, I'm guessing that this must have been a particularly painful process.<br/>As soon as his head grows back, Leila begins putting pressure on the troll again, making sure that his focus is on her the whole time.<br/><br/>\"Why is she still attacking the head?\" the mage asks me. \"Can't she see that it's not working?\"<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't be so sure about that,\" I tell him. \"You could easily tell that he was in a lot of pain earlier, when he was regenerating his head from his neck. Something tells me that this head regrowing trick of his isn't something that he can do indefinitely. Besides, it's not like we have any better ideas at this point. I say we just keep forcing him to regrow his head, and see what happens!\"<br/><br/> I take another quick look towards the battlefield, and it appears that things are not going very well for Velgos right now. Wilhelm is doing a very good job at constantly getting behind him, undetected, so the troll can't let his guard down for even a second. What's more, Velgos can't afford to turn his attacks against the assassin, either, because if he takes his eyes off Leila for even a second, she'll cut his head off again in the blink of an eye.<br/>It only takes one misstep on the troll's part for Leila to seize the opportunity once more, and to cut his head right off his shoulders. As she crushes it again, the troll regrows his head from the neck, but this time around it seems to be taking longer to fully create it, and it looks like he's having a bit of trouble recreating the exact same facial features that he had before. Leila doesn't leave him any time to fully recover, and she begins attacking him again, trying to catch him off guard one more time. However, Wilhelm seems to have somehow gotten injured in that last fight, so he is currently retreating, in order to tend to his wounds.<br/><br/>",

She then crushes Velgos' head under her sandal, but the head does not regenerate on the ground. Instead, a new head forms from the troll's neck, taking him only about five seconds to fully regenerate it to its original form. However, judging by the expression that he now has on his face, I'm guessing that this must have been a particularly painful process.<br/>As soon as his head grows back, Leila begins putting pressure on the troll again, making sure that his focus is on her the whole time.<br/><br/>\"Why is she still attacking the head?\" the mage asks me. \"Can't she see that it's not working?\"<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't be so sure about that,\" I tell him. \"You could easily tell that he was in a lot of pain earlier, when he was regenerating his head from his neck.

If the two of us close in from behind and attack him from both left and right, he won't have any place left to retreat, and Leila will be able to cut his head off easily. Better yet, we wouldn't even risk anything, since he'd be losing his head before he even gets the chance to strike back at us!\"<br/><br/>\"I... suppose that I could help out,\" the mage says. \"If it's risk-free...\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" I say, not giving him any more time to think it over. \"Let's get going, then!\"<br/><br/>I then make a rush towards the troll, and the mage is forced to follow soon afterwards, so he can catch up to me. I knew that he'd jump on the opportunity to join the fight, as soon as I'd offer him a plan without any risks. He's been acting with extreme caution ever since the first round started, but it's clear that he doesn't want to be seen as a coward. Of course he'd be more than happy to be able to prove his worth without endangering his life in any way. And my plan definitely sounds safe enough... at least in the way I presented it.<br/><br/> The fact of the matter is that I've omitted one small detail when I gave him the briefing. While the troll will definitely not get the chance to harm us before he gets his head cut off, depending on how much this next beheading is going to affect him, he may well have enough energy left in him to attack  us, even without his head on his shoulders. That is exactly why I'm not going to stab the troll at all, and let the mage do all the work. As for the mage's own safety... I'm sure that he'll find a way to handle himself. Probably.<br/>We both manage to get behind the troll, while Leila is keeping him busy, and when we are in attack range, I nod to the mage, and we both dash towards our enemy, from opposite sides. Just as I reach Velgos, I jump backwards, without attacking him in any way, and I let the mage stab him by himself. The mage looks shocked at my betrayal, but he doesn't have much time to react, because one of the troll's scimitars is already being swung towards him. <br/><br/>Leila immediately takes advantage of the distraction, and she cuts the troll's head off in the blink of an eye. This does not make Velgos stop his attack, however, whose scimitars have almost reached the mage's neck. At the very last moment before getting hit, the mage jumps back with superhuman speed, avoiding the fatal blow by mere inches. <br/><br/>",

The mage panics, and he tries to hide the light by putting his hand on top of his pocket, but the harm has already been done.<br/><br/>\"Please excuse the noise, ladies and gentlemen,\" the announcer says. \"That is the sound of our magic detectors being set off.

What do you think we're paying you for?\"<br/>The spectators seem to be unsure of how to react. Velgos appeared to be something of a crowd favorite, so seeing him die in front of their eyes must be giving them mixed feelings about this whole thing. They can't really blame us for having killed him, but they don't seem very eager to cheer for us either. What we get instead are a few moments of awkward silence, while the announcer is still struggling to come to terms with reality.<br/><br/>\"Velgos...\" the announcer says, this time in a pleading voice. \"Don't do this to me! Come on, I even bet good money on you! You can't just die on me like this! What about the rest of the second round? Who's going to fight the other divisions? Velgos, get up, damn you!\"<br/><br/>Once the announcer finishes his rant, we hear Venard, the arena owner, clearing his throat from somewhere behind the announcer.<br/><br/>\"Uh, please excuse me,\" the announcer says, to the spectators. \"I'll be back shortly...\"<br/><br/> He then heads in the direction of the arena owner, descending from his elevated platform and entering one of the upper levels of the main building surrounding the fighting area.<br/>As the announcer was talking, I was barely paying any attention to him, because I was focusing on something else, entirely. After studying the scimitars that had fallen from the troll's hands for a while, I came to the conclusion that they were both in surprisingly good condition. I'm also quite certain that they both have at least the sharpness and durability enchantments cast on them, so they should be pretty comparable to my dagger, in terms of usefulness.<br/><br/>I've never really liked wielding two weapons at the same time when fighting, but maybe I could take one of these with me, so I can use it when I'm in need of a weapon with longer reach? Or maybe I should take the other one too, and sell it at a shop? I'm not exactly sure how much it would be worth, but if I could get Daren to identify all of the enchantments cast on it, I'm sure I could negotiate a reasonable price at the local weapon shops.<br/><br/>",
