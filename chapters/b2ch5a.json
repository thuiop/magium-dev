We'll need all the help we can get against that troll.\"<br/>\"If you're worried about me backstabbing you,\" Wilhelm says, \"then I'll make sure to always be in your line of sight during the battle, so you can keep your eyes on me without much effort. Would that be enough to put your worries to rest?\"<br/><br/>\"I suppose...\" Bruce says. \"As long as I can easily see where you are at all times, you're not much of a threat.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" Wilhelm says. \"Fighting on the front lines is not exactly ideal for me, but I'd rather do this than be forced to fight alone. I only hope that you won't take advantage of this situation to use me as a decoy.\"<br/><br/>Damn it! Now I've lost my train of thought. What was I thinking about, before I got interrupted? I'm sure it had something to do with the troll.<br/><br/>As I take another look towards the fighting area and see the troll still waving at the crowds, my previous thoughts suddenly come back to me.<br/><br/>\"Hey, Leila,\" I say. \"Is it just me or is the troll wearing different armor this time around?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"It's still anti-magic armor, but now he also has shoulder pads. He probably switched armors in order to make it harder for us to cut his head off again.\"<br/><br/>\"Correct me if I'm wrong,\" I say, \"but isn't this specific model of armor he's wearing vulnerable to regular fire?\"<br/><br/> \"The armor he is wearing does not protect him against regular fire at all,\" Leila writes. \"Only against magical fire.\"<br/>\"That's what I thought,\" I say, and then I head towards the door leading to the corridors outside our room. <br/><br/>As I prepare to open the door, I turn towards Leila, to give her one final message before I go.<br/><br/>\"Leila, could you do me a favor?\" I tell her. \"I need you to take one of the torches that are lighting the halls and to bring it with you in the arena when the round begins. Make sure that you don't let the troll see it, when you approach him. When we're both in the fighting area, I'll give you a signal, and then you can throw the torch at him. Got it?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, but where are you going?\" Leila writes. \"What are you planning to do?\"<br/><br/>\"You'll find out soon enough,\" I say, and then I walk out the door.<br/><br/>I make sure that the guards are nowhere in sight, and I start heading directly towards Hadrik's division area. If memory serves, his room should be very close to ours.<br/><br/>",

I hear that the troll is holding members of their tribe hostage, and he's threatening to kill them unless they fight by his side. One of those tribe members is a female shaman. You don't see many of those, these days.\"<br/><br/>\"Wait did you say female shaman? So that's why she had those strange garments and markings on her face...\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean? You saw her?\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, one of the cells I'm guarding has a few ogres in it. It's the one closest to the locker rooms. I'm guessing Velgos must have asked the owner to move them here, temporarily, so he can easily kill one or two of them in case the warriors misbehave.\"<br/><br/>\"Hah! Those dumb ogres don't even know that their tribe members are right under their noses. Serves them right. If they were stupid enough to get captured, then they deserve to live their lives as the troll's henchmen. I'm sure they'll both provide us with good entertainment!\"<br/><br/>The guards both laugh, and then they resume their patrols.<br/><br/>",

As I keep walking, I make sure that I advance slowly enough to give Leila the time to catch up to me.<br/>The troll is still taunting me. He must be thinking that I came here to offer him a drink. I don't think he's ever had the privilege of tasting dwarven ale before. Judging by the burning sensation that I got in my throat when I drank my first bottle with Hadrik, I'd wager that this is the strongest alcoholic beverage that money can buy. Maybe Velgos would be a little more worried if he knew what I had in this bottle.<br/><br/>\"Are you trying to bribe me, human?\" Velgos says, with a laugh. \"It's going to take more than a bottle of ale to convince me to spare your life. How about you start by kneeling before me? I want every spectator in the crowd to see how pathetic you are, before I kill you!\"<br/><br/>I stop right in front of the troll, and I smile at him, while raising my bottle. Leila is now only a few dozen feet behind me, and she's closing in, with the other members of my division not far behind her. She is holding the torch behind her back, making sure that the troll doesn't notice it.<br/><br/>\"Cheers!\" I say to the troll, while I have my bottle raised in the air.<br/><br/>\"What are you trying to--\" Velgos starts to say, but I don't let him finish his sentence.<br/><br/>I quickly grab the bottle by its neck, and I smash it into the troll's skull, covering him in dwarven ale from head to toe. The troll seems shocked, unable to understand what is going on.<br/><br/> \"Leila, now!\" I shout, as I jump back from the troll.<br/>As soon as I give the signal, Leila throws her torch at the troll, igniting the flammable liquid, and causing the troll to light up in flames. Velgos starts screaming loudly, as he attempts to extinguish the fire from his head with his bare hands. Leila makes full use of this opportunity, and she quickly dashes towards her enemy, slicing one of his shoulder pads right off his armor, with one of her enchanted daggers. The troll grabs both of his scimitars in his hands, and he tries to cut Leila in half, but she jumps back in time, avoiding his strike.<br/><br/>\"I am going to destroy you,\" the troll shouts at us. \"I will cut you into pieces so small that they won't even find enough of you to give you a proper burial!\"<br/><br/>His eyes are red with rage, as the fire covering him is slowly dying out. The marks left from the burning flames are already starting to regenerate. I suppose I should have expected that regular fire would not be enough against an enemy with such high regenerative powers. What's next, then? If I don't quickly decide what I'm going to do now, the troll won't give me any more time to react. Should I go on the offensive, or should I retreat, giving the others the time to join me?<br/><br/>",

You'll have plenty of time to free them and get out of the city before they assemble the city guards.\"<br/><br/>\"I will hold you to that promise, human,\" the second ogre says, after thinking about my offer for a few more seconds. \"You'd better not be lying to us.\"<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't dream of it,\" I say.<br/><br/>The two ogres exchange one final look, and then they turn their back on me, preparing to go fight their former ally.<br/><br/>",

I'm going to finish them off as quickly as possible, so I can rejoin Leila and the others.<br/><br/>Judging by the size of their clubs, no amount of reflexes are going to save me if I engage these monsters up close, due to the huge area that they can cover with a single swing. I either need to be fast enough to dash in and out of their range, or strong enough to be able to kill them before they do me in.<br/><br/>I run towards the ogre on my right, baiting him to try smashing me with his club, and once he goes for the swing, I double up my speed, and I circle around him, stabbing him multiple times in the back. The other ogre tries to help his comrade, but he avoids hitting too hard, in order to not hit his friend by accident. The monster's already slow movements are even further slowed down by his holding back, which leaves me plenty of time to make one quick dash towards him, and to stab him in the heart. As soon as the second ogre is dead, I go back to the first one, which is now lying on the ground, and I slit his throat, finishing him off.<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_agility || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) >= 3) {%> <br/><br/>There's no use in prolonging this battle any further.

I either need to be fast enough to dash in and out of their range, or strong enough to be able to kill them before they do me in.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not fast enough to run circles around them without getting hit, but with my level of strength, I might just be able to pull this off.  I slowly advance towards one of the ogres, and I wait for him to attack me with his club. Once he brings his weapon down upon me, I raise my knife, holding it with both hands, and I block his strike right above my head. I then drop my knife, and I grab the club with both my hands, pulling it out of the ogre's grasp. Using my newly acquired weapon, I smash the ogre's head in before he gets the time to react, and then I move towards his friend, preparing to attack him as well. Now that I have the same range of attack as him, the monster no longer has any way to compensate for his slowness. He tries to strike me, but I'm much faster, and I manage to land a hit before he even begins his swing. One hit was all it took for me to send the ogre falling to the ground. As soon as I'm done fighting, I drop the club, and I pick my knife back up from the ground. <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_agility || 0) < 2 && (locals.v_strength || 0) >= 3) {%> Swinging a big piece of wood might have worked against these two idiots, but that troll is going to cut through it in an instant.

Ogres are both dumb and slow. The only thing they have going for them is their size and strength. With my wits, I should be able to outmaneuver them, even if I'm weaker than them.<br/><br/>I make a rush towards the ogres, trying to anticipate which direction they'll strike at me from by paying close attention to their slow movements. I realize that one of the ogres is about to swing his club towards me, so I step out of the way and try to get out of his range. Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough, and the monster's weapon smashed my head, killing me instantly.<br/><br/><% } %>",

If the two of us close in from behind and attack him from both left and right, he won't have any place left to retreat, and Leila will be able to cut his head off easily. Better yet, we wouldn't even risk anything, since he'd be losing his head before he even gets the chance to strike back at us!\"<br/><br/>\"I... suppose that I could help out,\" the mage says. \"If it's risk-free...\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" I say, not giving him any more time to think it over. \"Let's get going, then!\"<br/><br/>I then make a rush towards the troll, and the mage is forced to follow soon afterwards, so he can catch up to me. I knew that he'd jump on the opportunity to join the fight, as soon as I'd offer him a plan without any risks. He's been acting with extreme caution ever since the first round started, but it's clear that he doesn't want to be seen as a coward. Of course he'd be more than happy to be able to prove his worth without endangering his life in any way. And my plan definitely sounds safe enough... at least in the way I presented it.<br/><br/> The fact of the matter is that I've omitted one small detail when I gave him the briefing. While the troll will definitely not get the chance to harm us before he gets his head cut off, depending on how much this next beheading is going to affect him, he may well have enough energy left in him to attack  us, even without his head on his shoulders. That is exactly why I'm not going to stab the troll at all, and let the mage do all the work. As for the mage's own safety... I'm sure that he'll find a way to handle himself. Probably.<br/>We both manage to get behind the troll, while Leila is keeping him busy, and when we are in attack range, I nod to the mage, and we both dash towards our enemy, from opposite sides. Just as I reach Velgos, I jump backwards, without attacking him in any way, and I let the mage stab him by himself. The mage looks shocked at my betrayal, but he doesn't have much time to react, because one of the troll's scimitars is already being swung towards him. Leila immediately takes advantage of the distraction, and she cuts the troll's head off in the blink of an eye. This makes Velgos stop his attack mid-swing, which gives the mage the time to remove his dagger from the troll's body, and to jump backwards, as far away as he can. Just like last time, Leila throws the head to the ground, and she crushes it beneath her sandal.<br/><br/>",

Eventually, he stops moving altogether, and he drops face-first to the ground, lifeless.<br/><br/><% } %>",

As she crushes it again, the troll regrows his head from the neck, but this time around it seems to be taking longer to fully create it, and it looks like he's having a bit of trouble recreating the exact same facial features that he had before. Leila doesn't leave him any time to fully recover, and she begins attacking him again, trying to catch him off guard one more time. However, Wilhelm seems to have somehow gotten injured in that last fight, so he is currently retreating, in order to tend to his wounds.<br/><br/>",

If the two of us close in from behind and attack him from both left and right, he won't have any place left to retreat, and Leila will be able to cut his head off easily. Better yet, we wouldn't even risk anything, since he'd be losing his head before he even gets the chance to strike back at us!\"<br/><br/>\"I... suppose that I could help out,\" the mage says. \"If it's risk-free...\"<br/><br/>\"Perfect,\" I say, not giving him any more time to think it over. \"Let's get going, then!\"<br/><br/>I then make a rush towards the troll, and the mage is forced to follow soon afterwards, so he can catch up to me. I knew that he'd jump on the opportunity to join the fight, as soon as I'd offer him a plan without any risks. He's been acting with extreme caution ever since the first round started, but it's clear that he doesn't want to be seen as a coward. Of course he'd be more than happy to be able to prove his worth without endangering his life in any way. And my plan definitely sounds safe enough... at least in the way I presented it.<br/><br/> The fact of the matter is that I've omitted one small detail when I gave him the briefing. While the troll will definitely not get the chance to harm us before he gets his head cut off, depending on how much this next beheading is going to affect him, he may well have enough energy left in him to attack  us, even without his head on his shoulders. That is exactly why I'm not going to stab the troll at all, and let the mage do all the work. As for the mage's own safety... I'm sure that he'll find a way to handle himself. Probably.<br/>We both manage to get behind the troll, while Leila is keeping him busy, and when we are in attack range, I nod to the mage, and we both dash towards our enemy, from opposite sides. Just as I reach Velgos, I jump backwards, without attacking him in any way, and I let the mage stab him by himself. The mage looks shocked at my betrayal, but he doesn't have much time to react, because one of the troll's scimitars is already being swung towards him. <br/><br/>Leila immediately takes advantage of the distraction, and she cuts the troll's head off in the blink of an eye. This does not make Velgos stop his attack, however, whose scimitars have almost reached the mage's neck. At the very last moment before getting hit, the mage jumps back with superhuman speed, avoiding the fatal blow by mere inches. <br/><br/>",

Then, as his eyes come in contact with mine, the look on his face changes, and he suddenly gains back his focus, while his eyes get filled with rage.<br/><br/>",

Almost immediately after the mage dies, Leila dashes behind the troll, giving him no time to react, and she cuts his head off in one strike, crushing it under her foot soon afterwards.    <br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_agility || 0) < 2) {%> <br/>\"You!\" the mage shouts at me. \"This is all your fault!

What do you think we're paying you for?\"<br/>The spectators seem to be unsure of how to react. Velgos appeared to be something of a crowd favorite, so seeing him die in front of their eyes must be giving them mixed feelings about this whole thing. They can't really blame us for having killed him, but they don't seem very eager to cheer for us either. What we get instead are a few moments of awkward silence, while the announcer is still struggling to come to terms with reality.<br/><br/>\"Velgos...\" the announcer says, this time in a pleading voice. \"Don't do this to me! Come on, I even bet good money on you! You can't just die on me like this! What about the rest of the second round? Who's going to fight the other divisions? Velgos, get up, damn you!\"<br/><br/>Once the announcer finishes his rant, we hear Venard, the arena owner, clearing his throat from somewhere behind the announcer.<br/><br/>\"Uh, please excuse me,\" the announcer says, to the spectators. \"I'll be back shortly...\"<br/><br/> He then heads in the direction of the arena owner, descending from his elevated platform and entering one of the upper levels of the main building surrounding the fighting area.<br/>As the announcer was talking, I was barely paying any attention to him, because I was focusing on something else, entirely. After studying the scimitars that had fallen from the troll's hands for a while, I came to the conclusion that they were both in surprisingly good condition. I'm also quite certain that they both have at least the sharpness and durability enchantments cast on them, so they should be pretty comparable to my dagger, in terms of usefulness.<br/><br/>I've never really liked wielding two weapons at the same time when fighting, but maybe I could take one of these with me, so I can use it when I'm in need of a weapon with longer reach? Or maybe I should take the other one too, and sell it at a shop? I'm not exactly sure how much it would be worth, but if I could get Daren to identify all of the enchantments cast on it, I'm sure I could negotiate a reasonable price at the local weapon shops.<br/><br/>",

In other words, the end of this fight also marks the end of the round. The third and final round will commence shortly, as soon as the organizing team is done with the preparations. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"<br/><br/>He then turns towards us.<br/><br/>\"All gladiators will have to wait in their division areas until the beginning of the next round,\" he says. \"You will not be allowed to roam the halls any longer! Your rooms will be locked until the end of the third round. This time there will be no more... incidents.\"<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that he was looking directly at me when he said those last words. He must still be upset because I entered the fighting area before the beginning of the round last time. Oh well, at least I don't need any more information from my notebook. Being unable to exit my division area shouldn't affect me that much.<br/><br/>As soon as we get back to our room, we hear a person shouting loudly from the hallway outside our door. It is the voice of the ambassador of Ollendor.<br/><br/>\"What do you mean everything is going smoothly?\" the ambassador shouts. \"Are you mocking me?\"<br/><br/> \"Not at all, ambassador,\" Venard, the arena owner says. \"There have been no problems with any part of our arena event, as far as I'm aware.\"<br/>\"No problems?\" the ambassador says. \"The earl of Ollendor's killers are all still alive, and you are telling me that there are no problems?!\"<br/><br/>\"I assure you,\" Venard says, \"that our guests have been given no advantages over the other gladiators of the arena during these fights. Quite the opposite, in fact. Of course, if you have any doubts, you are free to talk with the organizing team in order to arrange the upcoming duels in any way you like. After all, you have always been the one to have the final say regarding the organization of these events.\"<br/><br/>\"I've been a fool to leave things in your care until now!\" the ambassador says, furiously. \"If you are too incompetent to get the job done right, then I'll just have to do it myself.\"<br/><br/>We then hear the ambassador storming away from the hallway, presumably towards the room where the organizing team was making the preparations for the next round.<br/><br/>\"Farewell, ambassador!\" Venard says, calmly, and then we hear him leaving as well.<br/><br/>\"It sounds like a certain someone really has it in for you,\" Leila writes, while looking at me.<br/><br/>\"Who cares?\" I say. \"It's not like they can do anything anymore even if they try.\"<br/><br/>",
