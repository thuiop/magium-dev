He sold us the tip for a reasonable sum, and we arranged the emptying of the streets together with the local guards, in case the healer in question was indeed the one we were looking for. Now then, Zack, you should just stand aside while I deal with these weaklings. I alone should be more than enough to finish them off.\"<br/><br/>\"No, you're not,\" Daren says. \"We already know that your god specializes in illusions. Illusions are useless against enemies who already expect them.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure about that, healer?\" the green robed mage says, and all of a sudden, hundreds of clones of both him and his ally fill the entire marketplace area around us.<br/><br/>\"You haven't moved from your original position, genius,\" Daren says, as he dashes towards him. \"I know which one is the real you.\"<br/><br/>As Daren reaches the two original mages, he slashes his sword and cuts through them both in one strike. Instead of dying, however, the two mages simply fade away into the air.<br/><br/>\"What is the meaning of this?\" Kate asks. \"If those two were in fact illusions, then does that mean that the real mages were hiding invisibly when they cast the illusion spell?\"<br/><br/> \"Arraka,\" I say, \"why didn't you tell us that the mages were invisible?\"<br/>\"Because they weren't,\" Arraka says. \"If anyone were to hide anywhere invisibly, I would have sensed them.\"<br/><br/>\"Then how do you explain the fact that the ones we were seeing were in fact illusions?\" I ask.<br/><br/>\"How am I supposed to know that, jackass?\" Arraka says. \"Figure it out yourself!\"<br/><br/>\"Can you at least figure out which ones of these are the originals?\" I ask.<br/><br/>\"No,\" Arraka says. \"I never bothered to learn how to tell the difference between clones and originals, because whenever someone would cast a spell like this against me, I would simply use a spell of my own to destroy them all at the same time, and that would be the end of that.\"<br/><br/>\"Does anyone have any idea why none of the clones have attacked us yet?\" Hadrik asks us. \"They're just standing there, smirking like a bunch of morons.

None of them are the originals.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you saying that the real mages were never actually here, and they just cast the illusion spell from afar?\" Daren asks.<br/><br/>\"No,\" Arraka says. \"I've been monitoring the whole area around us ever since I noticed that the streets were empty, and I guarantee you that the only mages who were close enough to cast an illusion spell on us were the two that ambushed us.\"<br/><br/>\"But that makes no sense,\" I say. \"If those two were the real mages, then what happened to them? Did they just turn into illusions as well when they cast the spell?\"<br/><br/>Suddenly, an idea comes to me.<br/><br/>\"Wait...\" I say. \"I think I may be onto something, but I'll need some confirmation before I'm sure. Illuna, check my thinking. Could this all be an illusion? Not just the clones before us, but the whole world around us, too? You know, like that time with the shaman.\"<br/><br/>\"No, that's impossible,\" Illuna says. \"If a mind affecting spell of that caliber had been cast on us, then there should have been a visual effect of some sort, for all of us to see, in the same way that the underground caverns were filled with smoke when the shaman cast his spell. There was no such--\"<br/><br/>Illuna pauses for a second, as realization dawns upon her.<br/><br/> \"The green light!\" she says. \"Of course! I should have realized it immediately! This also explains why their so called trap affected Rose. It's because the reverse is what actually happened. Their mind affecting spell could not target Rose, and so, it appeared to us as if she'd been rendered unconscious. It's probably the same for Flower as well.\"<br/>\"Great,\" Daren says. \"So we're back to square one, then. We need to find the real mages so we can kill them and get out of the illusion.\"<br/><br/>\"No, we don't,\" Illuna says. \"We only needed to do that with the shaman because he'd trapped himself in the illusion with us in order to prevent us from escaping, remember? Since the mages are not actually here with us, it means that this illusion's main purpose was not to kill us, but to buy time so that they could kill us in the real world while we were defenseless. This leads me to believe that time is flowing at the same speed here as in the real world, which is different from what we experienced in the shaman ritual.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh gods,\" Kate says. \"If that's true, then it means that Flower has been fighting the two mages by herself in the real world all this time!\"<br/><br/>\"Most likely,\" Illuna says. \"We need to get out of here quick. Everyone, close your eyes and start visualizing the moments before the mages cast the illusion on us. You need to do this with the conviction that the image in your head represents the real world, and that you want to return to it. If we all do this at once, we'll break the illusion's effect over us.\"<br/><br/>",

As I get a clear image of the city's streets in my mind, the image starts to become clearer and clearer, until I feel myself getting pulled into it, and suddenly I realize that my imagination had become reality without me even noticing it. As I open my eyes, I see myself standing in the middle of the street, but everything looks a lot different from how I remembered it. <br/>There are craters all around us, the walls from the houses on the side of the street have all been charred, and there's a huge skeletal dragon standing right in front of us. Rose is on her knees, crying, and Flower looks like she's barely able to stand on her feet, but she's staring at the dragon defiantly. She is bruised all over, and her clothes are a complete mess, but there is a very intimidating aura surrounding her, feeling as if it were made from a fire hotter than that of her elemental magic. When Flower senses that we've finally awoken from the illusion spell, she turns to us and she gives us a tired smile.<br/><br/>\"You broke the spell!\" the girl says. \"I knew you could do it. I knew it...\"<br/><br/>As she utters the last words, Flower's eyes slowly close, and then she drops to the ground, unconscious. Daren is now hurrying over to her side, in order to shield her from the dragon, in case it decides to strike her while she's down.<br/><br/>\"She was so reckless...\" Rose says, as she's holding back her tears. \"She never stopped fighting even after she had clearly exceeded her limits. She was desperately trying to protect you, even at the cost of her own life...\"<br/><br/> \"It's alright,\" Illuna says, as she takes control of the girl's body, but she doesn't get up from the ground. \"The girl only fainted due to exhaustion. She's not going to die.\"<br/>\"Do you see what you've done now, fool?\" Zack the necromancer tells his ally. \"If your useless god's spell had worked properly like you said it would, we wouldn't be in this mess!\"<br/><br/>\"Don't you dare pin this on me!\" the mage in green robes says, while he's sweating all over, looking as if he's about to faint from exhaustion as well. \"My spell was never designed to work against fusioned souls. It just targeted the soul that was controlling the body at the time and left the other one alone. There was no way I could have prevented it from happening. You're the only one to blame for this, you stingy bastard! If you had just used that stillwater summoning spell of yours when I told you to, they would have all died within seconds.\"<br/><br/>\"Be quiet, heathen,\" Zack says. \"I can only cast that spell once a day. It would be an insult to the great God of Death Ulruk if I were to waste its one daily use so early in the morning, on the likes of them.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you kidding me?!\" the green robed mage says. \"Do you have any idea how much magical energy I needed to spend in order to keep them in that illusion for so long? I had to cancel all of my protections two hours ago just so I'd be able to cast the damn spell! I don't even have my magic shield on right now!\"<br/><br/>Just as the green robed mage stops talking, an ice cone passes straight through his head, and soon afterwards he falls on the ground, lifeless.<br/><br/> \"Thanks for letting me know,\" Kate says.<br/>\"You wench!\" Zack says, furious. \"Do you have no honor?!\"<br/><br/>\"It's his own damn fault for not paying attention during a fight,\" Kate says. \"And don't you talk to me about honor! You would have done the exact same thing to us if Flower hadn't protected us while we were defenseless.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't you lecture me, wench!\" Zack says. \"There is no need for honor when killing irredeemable heathens such as yourselves!\"<br/><br/>",

Just as it reaches her, the dragon explodes into a thousand tiny pieces that get scattered throughout the whole area around us.  <br/><br/>\"Really, now...\" Arraka says.<br/><br/>As the dragon's bones fly in all directions, the ground begins to shake, and several skeletons start to slowly rise from it. It doesn't take me long to realize that this is the necromancer's doing, and that all of the skeletons standing in front of us are stillwaters.<br/><br/>\"Do you understand now, banshee?\" Zack says. \"Do you understand who you are facing against? This is the true power of the God of Death! If you get on your knees now and beg for Ulruk's forgiveness, he might just see fit to grant you a quick and painless death.\"<br/><br/>Arraka ignores the mage completely, choosing instead to stare intently at one of the skeletons that have risen from the ground.<br/><br/> \"Wait a minute!\" Arraka says. \"I know you! You're Vallen, right? Short-legs Vallen who couldn't hold a tune to save his life! You're not going to hurt me, are you? Remember all of those fun times we've had during the still winter? Remember that time when we had to fish you out of a pond because you fell in while you were practicing your flying spell and you suddenly remembered that you couldn't swim? Remember how we used to make fun of you because you always walked funny after you expended all your magical energy? Remember when I tied you to a tree and forced you to watch me slowly murder all of your friends until you could manage to hit all the notes in that kiddy song about the lion and the lamb? Those were the days, huh? Now, how did that song go again?\"<br/>Arraka clears her throat and she begins to sing.<br/><br/>\"Oh, there was a lamb, a lamb, a lamb,\" she sings. \"And that lamb had such bright white wool!\"<br/><br/>As Arraka sings the song, the skeleton named Vallen starts to shake uncontrollably, and it puts both its hands on its head, as if it were having an intense headache. Eventually, its pain turns into rage, and it roars loudly, as it starts shooting fire out of its hands. The fire simply brushes off Arraka's magical shield, and she acts as if nothing happened, continuing to sing her song.<br/><br/> \"Why are you just standing there, you fools?!\" Zack asks the other skeletons. \"Attack her! Kill her!\"<br/>The skeletons all start flinging spells at Arraka, attacking her with all types of elemental magic simultaneously, while also using spells to weaken her defenses. Arraka acts as if she doesn't even notice the onslaught of spells that are being cast upon her, and she continues to sing without any interruptions.<br/><br/>",

Since my skeletons are now fully protected against sonic attacks, you could say that they have become near indestructible! There's nothing you can do to hurt them.\"<br/>Arraka stops singing, and she smiles wickedly at the necromancer.<br/><br/>\"Oh, they are protected from sonic attacks, you say?\" she says, with a mocking tone, as the skeletons continue to attack her with everything they've got. \"How impressive! Truly, you are a mage among mages. But tell me, necromancer, did you consider shielding your puppets from pebbles as well?\"<br/><br/>\"What kind of a question is that, you little--\" Zack starts to say, but Arraka doesn't give him a chance to finish his question.<br/><br/>While the necromancer was talking, Arraka made a few pebbles from the ground float into her hand, and then she started flinging them with her fingers towards each of the skeletons. When the pebbles reached them, the skeletons exploded, but this time into pieces so small that they could very well be confused with specks of dust. <br/><br/>When the necromancer saw what happened, his jaw dropped, and he couldn't bring himself to utter another word. He was in too great of a shock.<br/><br/> \"Yeah, you go ahead and wrap that up and then send it to old Ulruk as a present,\" Arraka says, as she gestures towards the piles of dust on the ground. \"Tell him it's from Arraka. Tell him that he should be expecting many more presents from me in the near future. Tell him that once I'm done with the earthen plane, I'll be paying him a visit. I'll visit him, I'll visit Memphir, I'll visit every single one of the so-called gods that thought it would be a good joke to have me banned from the magical plane along with every other banshee in existence. And then we can all have a party together, while we reminisce over times long forgotten!\"   <br/>\"Shut up!\" Daren says to Arraka all of a sudden, as he starts walking towards her, with a furious look on his face. \"I couldn't care less about your past or your personal vendettas.

Maybe I can use that against her somehow. Maybe if I kill her, everything will come back to normal. Maybe if she dies, her spells will be undone, and everyone will come back to life. I won't know until I try.<br/><br/>I rush towards the banshee, but I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my stomach, as a rock flies into me and knocks me off my feet.<br/><br/>\"Oh, I'm sorry, was that too rough?\" Arraka says, as I struggle to catch back my breath. \"I'm not exactly sure how much damage you can take, since I've never really fought against a weakling like you before!\"<br/><br/>\"Please, leave him alone!\" Rose screams, while tears keep flowing from her eyes.<br/><br/>\"I wouldn't want to kill you right off the bat,\" Arraka says. \"We should enjoy ourselves to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?\"<br/><br/>She then flings another rock right below my chest, and I can feel my breath leaving me again.<br/><br/>\"Stop!\" Rose shouts. \"You're hurting him!\"<br/><br/> \"Huh,\" Arraka says. \"Well, I always knew you were a weakling, but I never imagined it would be this bad.

Are you actually telling me that I just witnessed time reversing itself and that everyone still remembers what happened? <br/><br/>I don't get a lot of time to think about what happened, because my suspicions suddenly get confirmed by an enraged Arraka.<br/><br/>\"A time weaver?!\" Arraka shouts from her amulet. \"Are you kidding me right now?! And it was Rose, of all people? You bastards knew this, didn't you? You all set me up! You knew that this would happen! You let me escape on purpose so you could laugh at me, didn't you? Well, you know what?! I'm done being nice! Next time I get out, I'm going to rip every single bone from your bodies and I'll make your families watch. You're going to beg me to give you the easy deaths I gave you today. Do you hear me? I am going to make your lives hell! Stop grinning at me you stupid lowlife dwarf!\"<br/><br/> \"That's enough, Arraka,\" Illuna says. \"I'm not sure what exactly happened after you escaped from the amulet, but I think I can get a general idea from what you just said. You lost. We won. Deal with it. If I hear any more of your whining, I'm going to close this amulet and never open it again. Do you understand?\"<br/>Arraka doesn't say anything, but I don't need to see her face to know that she must be fuming right now.<br/><br/>\"I'm... alive?\" the mage in green robes says. \"But... how?\"<br/><br/>\"It was the wench!\" Zack says, as he points towards Rose. \"I saw it all happen before my eyes. She reversed time! Do you know what this means? Do you know what it would mean if any of our gods could get ahold of this kind of power?!\"<br/><br/>Before the green robed mage gets to answer the question, a cone of ice flies straight through his head, and he dies instantly.<br/><br/>\"Your friend really shouldn't have told us that he canceled all of his protection spells two hours ago,\" Kate tells the necromancer. \"That's just begging to be killed over and over.\"<br/><br/>\"I don't care about that sad excuse for a mage anymore,\" Zack says. \"What I care about more than anything now is the woman you are travelling with. Hand her over peacefully, and I will make your deaths swift.\"<br/><br/>\"It's a tough decision to make,\" Hadrik says, with a grin, \"but I'm afraid we're going to have to turn down your generous offer.\"<br/><br/>",

If you stay too close to us you'll risk getting caught in the crossfire.\"<br/><br/>\"Okay,\" Rose says, as she heads towards the opposite end of the market square.<br/><br/>Once the skeletons have fully surfaced, two of them start attacking us simultaneously with a flurry of fire and water spells, while another one creates a magical barrier around him and all the other stillwaters. Daren uses his shield to create a magical barrier of his own around us all, but it looks like he won't be able to hold it for much longer if the stillwaters keep attacking at this rate.<br/><br/> \"If anyone has any ideas on how we can get out of this alive, now would be a good time to let us know,\" Daren says, as two newly formed walls of rock are closing in on his barrier, trying to break through it by using brute force.<br/>\"We can't fight them head on,\" Illuna says. \"We need to focus on figuring out their weaknesses. They may be stillwaters, but they're still only skeletons. If we examine them carefully, we are bound to discover a thing or two that we can use to our advantage.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, I'm not trying to rush you or anything,\" Daren says, \"but I doubt I can hold this barrier for another minute. Realistically, it'll probably break a lot sooner than that. So, yeah, if you're planning to look for weak spots, you'd better do it quick.\"<br/><br/>Illuna is right. Even if they are stillwaters, their frail undead bodies are bound to leave them with a few exploitable weaknesses. Azarius has shown us this much. Even if the necromancer has learned from his past mistakes and shielded them against sonic attacks, there still should be something we could take advantage of. Not to mention that the necromancer's spell only lasts five minutes and is limited to one use per day, so barring any more unexpected time reversals, we should be in the clear if we manage to hold out for the entire duration of the spell. <br/><br/>",

        "text": " As I examine the skeletons carefully, I notice something peculiar about them. Even though their auras feel similar to that of Eiden, their magical energy feels as if it were leaking out of their bodies at a very fast rate. If I were to venture a guess as to why that is happening, I would say it's most likely because their new bodies cannot keep up with the tremendous amount of energy they have at their disposal. I am honestly surprised that my stat device isn't reacting to any of this. I would have expected it to be beeping like crazy by now. <br/>I take out my stat booster to take a look at it, and I find out to my surprise that even though I don't have any new points to spend, there is a flashing message in the corner of the screen saying: 'Emergency mode available. Tap here to activate.\"<br/><br/>Emergency mode? Is this something that can only be activated when the device gets access to a great amount of energy? If so, then is this what Eiden did to power up my device after he pumped it with energy before my fight with the dragon? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't have much time to think this through. I'm going to have to rely on my guts, here. And my guts say that I should take this chance, while I still have it.<br/><br/> As I tap the emergency mode message, I suddenly feel a great amount of energy surging through my body, similar to what happened before my fight with the dragon, and just like last time, I realize that I now have access to an impressive roster of spells, as well as the knowledge required to be able to cast them.  For a moment, I could see two additional stats being displayed on the device's screen, next to the nine existent ones. The stats were named 'Magical power' and 'Magical knowledge', but they disappeared almost as quickly as they appeared.<br/>I think I may be starting to understand what's happening here. This 'Emergency mode' somehow powers up two hidden stats that I don't normally have access to, but it only does so temporarily, when the device gets ahold of a surplus of energy that it can't assimilate immediately. This is how Eiden powered up my device for my fight with Tyrath. I'm sure of it. The feeling I'm getting is exactly the same as back then, even though I don't seem to have access to nearly as many spells as I did last time. <br/><br/>This time around, it seems that I don't have any flight or teleportation spells available, so I guess I'll have to move around the old fashioned way. I'm also missing some of the bigger spells I had access to last time, and I can feel that the power behind each of my spells is significantly weaker than it was when Eiden powered up the device.<br/><br/> Regardless, this is the best chance I've got to turn the tables around, and I need to take full advantage of this opportunity. I'll first need to decide whether I want to engage the enemy alone, or if I should try to work with everyone as a team in order to take the skeletons out. Working as a team has its advantages, but it also means that I may be forced to limit the firepower behind some of my spells in order to avoid endangering my teammates. However, if I convince them to wait here, I can provide them with various protections that will both keep them safe and out of my way for the duration of the fight.<br/><br/>",

Can't you see how slowly their supporting mage is reinforcing individual parts of the barrier? It's because he never learned how to properly localize his energy output! I kept telling him about it six hundred years ago, but the idiot wouldn't believe me until I demonstrated it to him by using a goddamned tree branch to break through his barrier and puncture his lungs.\"<br/><br/>Taking advice from Arraka is not something I am particularly keen on doing right now, but as I take a look towards the skeleton's magical barrier, I can at least tell that she is not lying. The magical energy is spread thin throughout the barrier, which helps a great deal against spells with a wide area of effect, but it should leave it vulnerable against more focused attacks. I start charging up a lightning attack while I fly around in circles to avoid the other skeletons' magical projectiles.  When my attack is powerful enough, I stop for a second in order to get a clear shot, and then I aim directly at the supporting mage, making sure that all of the power behind my strike is concentrated on a single point.<br/><br/> My lightning strike goes straight through the barrier and it hits the supporting stillwater in the skull, killing him instantly. As the magical barrier starts to disappear, the other four skeletons that were hiding underneath it are now standing around, looking very confused. I take advantage of this and use a great deal of magical energy to create a large pool of acid underneath the stillwaters. <br/>The skeletons were caught unawares and they had no time to react. As they all sink slowly into the pool of acid, the air elementalist uses a wind spell to lift the upper half of his body that hasn't yet melted into the air, but I quickly raise two chunks of rock from the ground, and I use them to smash the skeleton's head between them. Eventually, all of the skeletons sink fully into the acid, and I decide to start heading towards the ground, before my device's energy depletes completely. Once I get down, the pool of acid disappears, but the skeletons had already melted completely before this happened, which means that the necromancer is now the only enemy left standing.<br/><br/>",

I was thinking that we could just wait them out, while we keep reinforcing the barrier and attacking them from a distance.\"<br/><br/>\"In that case, I'm hoping that you have some really good reinforcement spells,\" Daren says, \"because I've pretty much already exhausted all of mine.\"<br/><br/>\"Don't worry,\" I say. \"You just focus on keeping the barrier up. I'll take care of the reinforcements.\"<br/><br/>I turn towards Flower and Kate.<br/><br/>\"Can you three put some pressure on the stillwaters while Daren and I keep the barrier up?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Aye, aye, sir!\" Flower says, as she performs a military salute with her right hand.<br/><br/> \"I'll see what I can do,\" Kate says.<br/>\"Try to aim for the skeleton maintaining their magical barrier as much as possible,\" I say. \"He's the one that's going to be busy undoing my reinforcement spells.\"<br/><br/>\"And what am I supposed to do all this time?\" Hadrik asks.<br/><br/>\"Well, you can, uh...\" I start to say, but I pause to think for a second. \"You can be our last line of defense and make sure to punch back all of their spells in case our barrier fails before the time limit.\"<br/><br/>\"Great!\" Hadrik says. \"It's times like these that make me regret the fact that I didn't bring a pack of playing cards with me when I joined the tournament.\"<br/><br/>Once everyone agrees to follow my plan, I go back to reinforcing Daren's barrier, while Kate, Flower and Illuna start to cast their spells at the stillwaters. Holding the barrier against so many simultaneous attacks is proving to be a little more difficult than I had originally thought. Daren is already at his limit, and keeping the barrier up by myself is quickly starting to drain me of energy. The girls don't seem to be doing very well either, because they've yet to break through the skeletons' barrier, while the supporting stillwater is doing all he can to counter my reinforcement spells.<br/><br/>This isn't working out. I need to revise my plan, or we're not going to last until the five minute mark.<br/><br/>",

By the time Hadrik gets back, the supporting skeleton places a magical barrier around their master, which the dwarf is now trying to break with a flurry of fists.<br/>Daren heads for the five stillwaters, and when he comes close to them, one of the skeletons shoots a powerful beam of fire towards him. Daren uses his sword to absorb all of the fire, and then he sends it back towards his attacker. The skeletons' barrier defends them from the blow, but Daren's actions seem to have caught the stillwaters' undivided attention. They are now all firing spells towards him, while he uses his shield to block and his sword to absorb their elements. <br/><br/>This is what we were waiting for. I wave at Flower, and she nods her head, as she starts to run towards the stillwaters. While running, she jumps high into the air, and she then uses her fire jets to propel herself higher, as she goes to position herself above the skeletons' barrier. I follow her lead and use my air magic to lift myself into the air. Using air magic to fly is nowhere near as easy as it sounds, and I'm feeling a lot clumsier than when I was using the flight spell in my fight with the dragon, but it should be good enough for my intents and purposes.<br/><br/> I catch up with Flower, and we both position ourselves some thirty feet above the stillwaters' barrier, putting a bit of distance between ourselves in order to make it harder for the skeletons to target us both.

I kept telling him about it six hundred years ago, but the idiot wouldn't believe me until I demonstrated it to him by using a goddamned tree branch to break through his barrier and puncture his lungs.\"<br/><br/>Taking advice from Arraka is not something I am particularly keen on doing right now, but as I take a look towards the skeleton's magical barrier, I can at least tell that she is not lying. The magical energy is spread thin throughout the barrier, which helps a great deal against spells with a wide area of effect, but it should leave it vulnerable against more focused attacks. I start charging up a lightning attack while I'm still in the air, and when it becomes powerful enough, I aim it directly at the supporting mage, making sure that all of the power behind my strike is concentrated on a single point.<br/><br/> My lightning strike goes straight through the barrier and it hits the supporting stillwater in the skull, killing him instantly. As the magical barrier starts to disappear, the other four skeletons that were hiding underneath it are now standing around, looking very confused. I take advantage of this and use a great deal of magical energy to create a large pool of acid underneath the stillwaters. <br/>The skeletons were caught unawares and they had no time to react. As they all sink slowly into the pool of acid, the air elementalist uses a wind spell to lift the upper half of his body that hasn't yet melted into the air, but I quickly raise two chunks of rock from the ground, and I use them to smash the skeleton's head between them. Eventually, all of the skeletons sink fully into the acid, and I decide to start heading towards the ground, before my device's energy depletes completely. Once I get down, the pool of acid disappears, but the skeletons had already melted completely before this happened, which means that the necromancer is now the only enemy left standing.<br/><br/>",

But her expression is not the only thing that feels empty about her. Her aura is completely different from before as well. It feels hollow, almost lifeless, and her skin is much whiter, almost as if there was no longer any blood running through her veins.<br/>\"Rose!\" Kate shouts. \"You're alive!\"<br/><br/>\"No,\" Daren says, with a very dark look in his eyes. \"This isn't Rose.\"<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" Kate asks. \"Of course it's Rose. She's right there!\"<br/><br/>\"Only her body is there,\" Illuna says. \"Rose is dead. What you see before you is a revenant. An undead being that is born with the host's previous memories, but with a completely different personality. Now I understand why the necromancer went out of his way to cast a sacrificial spell before killing himself. It was so he could make Rose into a revenant.\"<br/><br/>\"No, that can't be true!\" Kate says, with desperation in her voice, as Rose gets up from the ground and starts to walk slowly away from us. \"Rose, tell them that isn't true!\"<br/><br/>\"The one you refer to as Rose is no more,\" the revenant says, without turning her head towards us. \"I am a servant of Ulruk, the God of Death, and my task is to bring this time weaver body to him safely.\"<br/><br/>\"Like hell, you will, you undead scum,\" Daren says, as he pulls out his sword. \"You're going to leave her body here, so we can give her a proper burial.\"<br/><br/> \"You are in no position to stop me, healer,\" the revenant says. \"I am not like your friend, who did not know how to control her powers. I only have to freeze time for a few hours, and from your point of view, it will be as if I'd teleported out of the city. Now, if you'll excuse me, my master is waiting for me.\"<br/>She then starts walking slowly away from us again, without even bothering to look back, as if she doesn't even consider us to be a threat. Daren's hands are trembling as he looks towards the revenant, and he appears frozen in place. Even if he knows that it isn't Rose, it must still be hard for him to bring himself to attack her.<br/><br/>\"Oh, one more thing before I go,\" the revenant says, as she stops and turns her head towards us. This time, the empty look in her eyes is replaced with one of regret. \"Take care of the kids for me, will you? I don't think that I'll be coming back to that house anytime soon...\"<br/><br/>\"Stop!\" Daren shouts. <br/><br/>He then rushes towards the revenant and tries to slash her with his sword, but she disappears without a trace before he could land a hit, and the only thing that his blade gets to cut is empty air.<br/><br/>As we all stand there in silence, a loud booming noise suddenly starts to echo all throughout the city.<br/><br/>",

It appears that all of the screens are displaying the same thing, which is to say a gnome with messy hair, wearing protection goggles and an oil-stained lab coat, who is currently fiddling with some wires in some kind of a workshop, while he's humming a joyful tune. After a few more seconds of humming, the gnome suddenly looks towards us, takes off his goggles, and he glues his face to the screen.<br/>\"How peculiar,\" the gnome says, as he backs away from the screen. \"How very peculiar! I could swear that I've already connected these wires a million times before, but I've never seen the red light turn green until now! Well, no matter! Can everyone hear me?\"<br/><br/>There is a pause in which we can hear a low murmur coming from the people watching the screens from their windows.<br/><br/>\"Wait, what am I saying?\" the gnome says. \"This is a one way transmitter. Even if you answer me, I won't be able to hear you. Okay, here's what I'll do. I'm gonna go ahead and read you this little speech I've got written here on my parchment, and if nobody can actually hear me, I'll just read it again some other time. Now, where did I put that blasted parchment?\"<br/><br/>The gnome disappears under the screen for about ten seconds, during which the murmur in the market place intensifies.<br/><br/> \"Well, I could swear I had it around here, somewhere!\" the gnome says, as he comes back from under the screen. \"No matter, I'll just improvise, then!\"<br/>The gnome clears his throat before he continues.<br/><br/>\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" the gnome says. \"Or should I just be saying gentlemen in this case? Since there aren't any women mages? Gentlemen and gentlemen! Welcome, to the Magium tournament! I am Golmyck, the king of Thilias, and I have a public announcement to make. First of all, I would like to begin with an apology to all of the mages that have joined this tournament. When you first arrived on the continent, you were all told that you'd be receiving your objectives privately, but unfortunately, the device that was supposed to be relaying these messages to you broke shortly after your arrival. I have been trying to fix it ever since, but given that a whole week has already passed, I decided to use this old transmitter as a temporary solution, until I manage to get the original device to work properly. Normally, this transmission should be reaching all of the cities of Varathia and even some areas in the wilderness, but since I can't guarantee that every single mage on the continent will be seeing this, I would like to ask you all to pass this information to your fellow participants who missed the announcement!\"<br/><br/> The gnome clears his throat again.<br/>\"And now that the introductions are out of the way,\" Golmyck says, \"I believe it is finally time to give you all what you've been waiting for.\"<br/><br/>The gnome grins.<br/><br/>\"Your first objectives!\" he says.<br/><br/>-----End of book 1-----<br/><br/>",
