Two guards are currently standing on each side of the throne, while Albert and Peter are leaning against the wall on our left. The rest of us are all seated in the chairs that are facing the king, including Leila's father and Breynan, who were also invited to the meeting, along with us. <br/><br/>\"Now, then...\" the king of the underground says, as he gets a serious expression in his eyes. \"I believe we should get straight to the point. When I was told of your group, I wasn't aware that the stillwater girl was in your team, but now that I know she's with you, everything makes much more sense. Am I correct in assuming that you all came here to kill the king of Ollendor?\"<br/><br/>\"We did...\" Melindra says. \"But I don't remember ever meeting you. How do you know who I am?\"<br/><br/> \"Well, I don't know your name,\" the king says, \"but I've had informants in the palace for quite some time, and eight years ago they told me how a stillwater girl wearing pajamas was banished from our continent by the mad king. Luckily for me, you are still wearing the same type of clothes, so it was easy for me to recognize you even after having been given such a vague description.\"<br/>\"Hey!\" Melindra says. \"I'll have you know that these clothes are in no way similar to what you people wear as pajamas! Tell me... what pajamas have you ever seen with such an elegant design and high quality fabric? Do you have any idea how long it took me to find someone capable of custom tailoring these clothes for me? Six hundred years ago, the only people who didn't wear these types of garments were servants and prisoners, but nowadays people can't even tell that they are not meant to be sleepwear. It's outrageous!\"<br/><br/>\"My apologies!\" the king of the underground says. \"I did not mean to insult your clothing. I was simply repeating what my men have told me. I imagine that most clothes would start to feel uncomfortable, once you've gotten used to wearing only garments made of such fine silk.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes!\" Melindra says. \"That is exactly why I can't bring myself to wear any other types of clothes. Finally, someone gets it!\"<br/><br/>",

All instances of the expression 'to blow up' will henceforth be interpreted as 'to explode'. The Overseer protocol will now begin an investigation in order to find the cause for your three buildings exploding overnight.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you mocking me?!\" Billy Bob says.<br/><br/>\"The Overseer protocol does not possess the ability to mock,\" the Overseer says. \"The protocol's only purpose is to provide assistance. If you are unsatisfied with the services provided, you can state your complaint, and your request will be handled as soon as possible.\"<br/><br/>\"Forget it!\" Billy Bob says. \"I'll just go ask the guards for the information I need.

We are also quite certain that there was nobody else there, because otherwise our listening device would have at least recorded them opening or closing the door.

Now, why do you think a highly intelligent machine would do such a thing?\"<br/>\"Who knows?\" Hadrik says. \"Maybe it malfunctioned or something.\"<br/><br/>\"That is one possiblity...\" the king says. \"However, another more likely possibility is that the Overseer is a little smarter than we think, and it was in fact transmitting that message directly to us.\"<br/><br/>\"You think the Overseer knew that you had listening devices in that room?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"There is no way to be sure,\" the king says. \"However, that is the scenario which would make the most sense to me.

You can never know, in these situations.\"<br/><br/> \"With all due respect, my king,\" Albert says. \"Do you not think that you might be overestimating this Overseer just a little bit? It is after all, only a machine.\"<br/>\"Machine or no, we cannot afford to waste such an opportunity,\" the king of the underground says. \"Don't forget that Breynan has been warning us for a long time that the Overseer might in fact be smarter than it looks. We should at the very least try to treat this matter as seriously as we can. If it all turns out to be just one big misunderstanding, then so be it, but the potential to gain such a powerful ally on our side is too great to be simply ignored.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, your majesty,\" Albert says. \"Of course. We will look into it as soon as we are able.\"<br/><br/>\"Actually,\" the king says, \"I've already sent scouts to the surface so they can monitor the green-eyed metal balls and see if they are trying to bait us into an ambush or not. As long as everything is fine, we'll be sending a small team tomorrow to negotiate with the Overseer, and I would like our new allies to accompany them as well, if they agree to it, of course. Ultimately, it all depends on what the healer in armor decides, since I'm assuming he's the leader of their group.\" <br/><br/> \"Umm, actually, neither of us is the leader,\" Daren says. \"We usually like to discuss these types of matters between ourselves, before we make important decisions.\"<br/>\"I understand,\" the king says. \"In that case, I will give you some time to reach a conclusion, and you can give us your answer tomorrow. Would that be alright with you?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" Daren says. \"We will tell you tomorrow what we've decided.\"<br/><br/>\"Very well,\" the king says. \"Then we'll discuss the rest of the details once you've decided whether you want to join us or not. Until then, please make yourselves at home. Peter will show you to your rooms as soon as we'll have them ready for you. But where are my manners? I shouldn't be the one doing all the talking.

I'm still too tired to be able to cast any decent healing spells, and these wounds are beginning to feel a little uncomfortable...\"<br/><br/>\"Ah, yes, of course,\" the king says. \"I will arrange for one of our healers to come see you as soon as he is done with his current patients. In the meantime, you can go back to the room where we came from and wait for him there, unless you have any other questions to ask of me.\"<br/><br/>\"Nah, I think we're good for now,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"Alright then,\" the king says. \"Well, in that case, I hope you will all have a pleasant stay, and we will be resuming our discussion tomorrow, after you've made your decision.\"<br/><br/> He pauses for a second to take a quick glance at Kate, but then he addresses one of the rebels instead.<br/>\"Oh, and one more thing,\" the king says. \"Breynan, I know that this won't seem fair to you, but I want you to stay behind tomorrow, when our men visit the Overseer.\"<br/><br/>\"My king?...\" Breynan says, apparently in a state of shock.<br/><br/>\"I realize that I am going against your wishes, but I hope you will respect my decision,\" the king of the underground says, in a more firm tone of voice.<br/><br/>\"But, your majesty...\" Breynan says. \"Of all the people in this place, I am by far the one who knows the Overseer the best! I also interacted directly with him on numerous occasions!\"<br/><br/>\"And that is precisely why I don't want you to be part of that team, tomorrow,\" the king says. \"You are too emotionally involved in this matter to be able to keep a cool head. I want to make sure that the negotiations will be done in a professional manner, by people who are in no danger of letting their feelings cloud their judgment. Rest assured that I've read all of your reports concerning the Overseer, and I will make sure that the negotiations team tomorrow will be taking all of your notes into account. You will, however, not be joining this team, and that is my final decision.

As we make our way back into the waiting room, we all place ourselves near the chairs from the exit that leads towards the teleporter, waiting patiently for the healers to arrive. In the meantime, Peter went to get our rooms ready, while Breynan also went on his own way, without even saying goodbye to us, still looking pretty affected by what the king of the underground had said to him.<br/><br/>\"I guess that Kelrim went back to the quarantine area,\" Daren says, after he takes a quick look around and sees that the goblin is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>\"Either that, or he went to look for his friends,\" Hadrik says.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I guess that might actually be more likely, if I think about it,\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"Forget about the damn goblin!\" Arraka says. \"We have far more pressing issues to concern ourselves with!\"<br/><br/><% } %><% if((locals.v_b3_ch2_goblins || 0) == 1) {%> \"Good,\" the king of the underground says. \"I will be seeing each of you later, then.

Hell, it took me years to develop my aura hardening technique, and I'm not even sure if I've ever seen someone use anything similar in my travels.\"<br/><br/> \"Hadrik is right,\" I say. \"I've been travelling all across the Western Continent, in search for a way to become a mage ever since I was seventeen, and even the most obscure tomes that I've read did not contain any information about aura manipulation techniques.\"<br/>\"Oh yeah?\" Arraka says. \"Well, too bad! Even if you can't do it, the gods most certainly can, and the same goes for Eiden, the golden fox and Tyrath, although the lizard probably can't do it when he's not in his molten lava form. I'm willing to bet that Azarius can do it too, and probably also every other sage except for that moron, Talmak. This isn't something you can just ignore. Not being able to counter these types of techniques gives your opponent an enormous advantage over you. Hell, you saw what that frail old man was doing to you earlier. You can't keep relying on me to point out the weaknesses of these techniques every time they are used against you! You need to learn to deal with them yourselves.\"<br/><br/>\"And how are we supposed to do that?\" I say.<br/><br/>\"With training, obviously,\" Arraka says. \"I'm going to hammer that knowledge into your useless heads, even if it kills me. Mark my words!\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" I say. \"Speaking of training, I just remembered that I had something important to discuss with Leila's father about my stat device.\"<br/><br/>\"Yes, Barry, what is it?\" Leila's father says.<br/><br/><% if((locals.v_b3_ch1_unlock || 0) == 2) {%> \"Well, first of all, I was wondering if you could help me unlock my device,\" I say. \"We got it locked by accident yesterday, while we were trying to unlock the hidden aura stats.\"<br/>\"Oh!\" Leila's father says. \"The aura stats lock!

I would have made these stats available on Leila's device as well, but I had to sort of permanently deactivate them on her stat booster, in order to get her magical writing feature to work properly.\"<br/><br/>\"So, can we do it now?...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"Right now?\" Leila's father says. \"I suppose it wouldn't be a problem.

        "text": " After I wave goodbye to my friends, Leila, her father and I head together towards one of the corridors leading outside of the waiting room. As we are entering the tunnel, we can hear Hadrik's loud voice echo throughout the hall, as he begins to tell everyone a story from his travels that he just remembered.  <br/>\"Barry, I've always meant to ask you something,\" Leila writes, after taking a short glance towards Hadrik, right before we enter the corridor. \"How come you never tell us any of your stories, like Hadrik and Daren do all the time?\"<br/><br/>\"My stories?...\" I ask her, confused.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"From your travels. You did just mention earlier that you've been travelling throughout the Western Continent ever since you were seventeen, didn't you?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh,\" I say. \"Well yeah, I've been in a lot of places, but there isn't that much to talk about, really. Mostly I've been spending my time in libraries, reading old parchments and other stuff like that. None of the things I did could even begin to compare with any of Daren and Hadrik's adventures. I would just end up boring everyone to death with my mundane stories.\"<br/><br/> \"Mundane stories?\" Leila writes, as she turns her head towards me and raises an eyebrow, while we're still walking down the corridor, behind Leila's father. \"Didn't you once tell me that the reason why you know how to fly planes is because you've spent a few months testing out flying machine prototypes for a mad gnome inventor, in exchange for information on how to become a mage? And didn't you also say that one of those prototypes was so bad that its propeller stopped in mid-air, and you were forced to glide your way down to safety? Does this also qualify as a mundane story to you?\"<br/>\"I guess so...\" I say. \"I mean, it's not like I've been spending my life fighting wyverns and rock golems or something.\"<br/><br/>\"Just out of curiosity...\" Leila writes. \"How many more of these 'mundane events' happened to you in the past?\"<br/><br/> \"Well, let's see...\" I say. \"I've been doing a lot of odd jobs along the years in order to pay for my food and travels, so I guess I could start with those. For example, there was this one time when I went to some ruins with an archaeology professor and we almost got buried alive when we accidentally triggered one of the traps. And I've also worked as an apprentice to quite a few mages, who were all very surprised at my ridiculously advanced knowledge of theoretical magic gained from my years of relentless study, and they wanted me to help them develop new spells. I think I've lost count of how many of those experimental spells ended up exploding in my face. Then there was that time when I was accompanying a relic hunter into an old cave, and we somehow ended up getting chased by a group of goblins. Man, that was a close one. To this day, I'm still not sure how we were able to make it out of there in one piece.\"<br/>Leila giggles silently.<br/><br/>\"I can't believe that you were actually claiming to have been an 'everyday ordinary guy' before coming to Varathia,\" she writes. \"How is what you've described to me just now supposed to be anything close to 'ordinary'?\"<br/><br/>\"It's not?\" I ask her, surprised. \"But why wouldn't it be? I mean sure, all this stuff may sound dangerous when I talk about it, but I'm certain that even the most ordinary of people would be open to taking a few risks like these, if it meant getting one step closer to achieving their lifelong dreams.\"<br/><br/>\"No, Barry, I think that's just you,\" Leila writes, with a smile. \"But thank you for telling me all of this. I think I'm starting to understand you a little better, now.\"<br/><br/>",

He is also a generalist, and he is rather skilled, but no matter how many times he's reached the final round of the yearly sage tournaments, he has never once been able to get even close to beating Azarius. Ironically, the two of them are pretty good friends from what I've heard, although I've never seen them interacting with each other during the brief period of time in which I was serving as Brinhorn's apprentice. Anyway, the event I was talking about happened one day when the old mage came to me, saying that he had found a way to solve both our problems. He was claiming that he had found out about an artifact powerful enough to both turn me into a mage and to give him the power to defeat Azarius. Oh, how wrong he was...\"<br/>\"I take it that the artifact wasn't helpful, then?\" Leila writes.<br/><br/> \"It's not that it wasn't helpful,\" I say. \"It's that it didn't even exist in the first place. It was all a trap, set up by some of Brinhorn's rivals from the sage tournament, who were upset that they could never reach the final round because of him, and who had decided to rid themselves of him before the contest even began, so they could finally get to challenge Azarius themselves. Man, that was a day to remember... We were basically trapped in a maze full of magical traps for hours on end, with barely any hopes of making it out of there alive. I practically had to use all of my knowledge about how the different types of magic work together in order to get us out of there in one piece. Luckily for me, Brinhorn was a generalist who could practically cast most types of spells in existence, so all I had to do was steer him in the right direction.\"<br/>\"Steer him in the right direction?\" Leila writes, with her eyes wide open, as her father has also temporarily stopped from his work to take a good long look at me. \"You?... But... you can't cast magic!\"<br/><br/> \"Of course I can't cast magic,\" I say. \"But that didn't stop me from reading thousands of obscure books about all the ways in which the different types of magic work individually, and how they interact with each other. Hell, some of those books that I read were never even published. They were written by random mage hermits that nobody would take seriously, and who were so happy that someone was finally willing to listen to their theories that they let me read their whole manuscripts for free, just so they could have a lengthy talk with me about their writing afterwards. My notebook is filled with this type of knowledge that I've amassed during my travels. None of it managed to help me in any way to become a mage, though.\"<br/>\"Huh...\" Leila writes. \"So, you were about to tell us how you escaped from the maze?...\"<br/><br/>",

        "text": " \"Right, right, of course...\" I say. \"Where was I again? Oh yeah, I was talking about Brinhorn. You see, the thing about Brinhorn is that he had an amazing array of spells at his disposal, but he only knew the very basic applications for each of them. That's probably also the reason why he could never compete with Azarius. Just knowing how to cast the spells is not good enough. The main advantage you get by being a generalist is the flexibility. You can't just cast spells randomly as if you were a specialist and call it a day. Someone who specializes in a certain type of magic will always be better at it than you, on an individual level, but if you combine several types of magic together, the potential is limitless. The more spells you know, the more combinations are available to you, and as long as you know exactly how each individual spell interacts with all the others and how you need to cast them, you can become virtually unbeatable. Given how many spells Brinhorn had in his repertoire, there were countless ways in which he could have dealt with the traps, but since I wasn't exactly sure how much control he had over his own spells, I decided to go with the simplest idea that came to my head, so I told him to try and use multi-step dispelling.\"<br/>\"Multi... what?...\" Leila writes.<br/><br/> \"Multi-step dispelling,\" I tell her again. \"It's a technique that I kind of made up myself, based on information that I gained from reading some older books and from talking with some of the hermit mages that I mentioned earlier. For some reason, nobody else thought of this before, but as long as you can tell exactly what spells were used to create a more complex spell, you can reverse-cast those exact spells against it, in order to cancel its effects. Obviously, this technique won't work all that well against a skilled mage like Azarius, because he'd be able to just change his spells on the fly, in order to confuse you, but if you're dealing with a magical trap, you have all the time you need to figure out which spells you need to cast and in which order. What's more, this technique is really low-risk when you use it against traps, because even if you fail, you won't trigger the trap by accident, so you can pretty much try it again and again, until you get the timing right. We had to spend the whole day in that maze until Brinhorn learned to reliably use the technique, but thankfully his rivals weren't waiting to ambush us outside, so we made it home safely afterwards.\"<br/>\"Hold on a moment...\" Leila writes, seemingly in a slight state of shock. \"You're telling me that you're actually the one who invented the 'Brinhorn dispelling technique'? The technique that completely revolutionized dispelling magic all around the world a few years ago and that got included in most modern mage manuals to date?\"<br/><br/> \"Yeah, well, I didn't mind all that much that Brinhorn took the credit, really,\" I say. \"It wasn't really that complicated of a concept to begin with. You just need to do everything in reverse. The incantation, the movements, the manipulation of the aura flow... I mean it's not like the idea itself is all that revolutionary. The really difficult part is in the execution. You have no idea how many tries it took Brinhorn until he could finally get the timing and the motions right. And even if we theoretically knew how the technique worked, it still took hours of me and Brinhorn racking our brains together, trying to figure out the multitude of spells that had been used to set up some of those magical traps.\"<br/>\"Yes, but still...\" Leila writes. \"Did it seriously not cross Brinhorn's mind that he should at least credit you for your own technique?...\"<br/><br/>",

'Barry's dispelling technique'? There are thousands of Barrys out there. How would anyone have known that it was me? To be honest, the annoying part for me wasn't the lack of credit, but the fact that after that whole episode with the maze, Brinhorn kept insisting that he wanted to introduce me to these scholars he knew, so that we could research magic on a theoretical level together. By that time, I already knew that none of the knowledge available in the world could get me what I wanted, and that the only hope of me being able to achieve my dreams was through the help of a magical artifact of some sort, so I refused him again and again. I had no interest in becoming a scholar. All I wanted was to become a mage. As soon as I found out a rumor about some new artifact, I left the town in which Brinhorn resided, and I haven't heard from him since. Then again, I can't say that I would be too surprised if I ran into him right here in Varathia one of these days. He did seem like the type who would join a tournament like this, after all.\"<br/><br/> \"Barry, what you've just told us is incredible!\" Leila's father says. \"I did not know it was even possible to have such a high understanding of magic only from reading books!\"<br/>\"Yeah, but it's still not high enough, unfortunately,\" I say. \"I've been trying for days to find the type of loopholes that Eiden is using when casting his spells, but I'm still not getting any closer to finding them. The most I can do is figure out the stuff that he already used in front of us, but in order to find new loopholes, I would need a much more intuitive understanding of how magic works. This brings me to another important thing I wanted to ask of you, doctor Reidzek. Do you know if it would be possible for you to also unlock the magical stats from the stat device, along with the hidden aura stats?\"<br/><br/>\"If by magical stats you are referring to the Magical Knowledge and Magical Power stats, then I'm afraid the answer is no,\" Leila's father says. \"The aura stats were only hidden, but the magical stats were locked for a reason, and unless you know the right code, you will never be able to unlock them. If you try to forcefully unlock these stats without the code, you could risk permanently damaging your device. I wouldn't recommend it.\"<br/><br/>",

Half-lessathi were never really seen as equal to pure-blood lessathi, so the locking of the magical stats was almost certainly put in place in order to make sure that a half-lessathi would never get access to these stats by accident. On the other hand, the aura stats were hidden as a safety precaution, because they were still in an experimental state when the lessathi stopped working on these devices, and they never got to finish all the tests.

What do you guys think that--\"<br/>\"Hey, everyone,\" Leila writes in big blue letters, making Daren stop mid-sentence, \"did you know that Barry is the one who invented the Brinhorn dispelling technique?\"<br/><br/>\"What?...\" Daren says, as the others are looking towards me, with puzzled expressions on their faces. \"No, don't be ridiculous. That technique was invented by Brinhorn. It's even in the name. I'm sure that Barry must have been joking, and you simply misunderstood him, or something.\"<br/><br/>\"I wasn't joking,\" I say. \"I really did come up with that technique, while I was working as Brinhorn's apprentice. I told him he could name the technique after himself, because I didn't care all that much about the credit. I'm still not seeing what the big deal is, though. It's just a technique like any other. Even if I hadn't come up with it, I'm sure that somebody else would have done it eventually.\"<br/><br/>\"Barry, what are you saying--\" Daren starts to say, but he gets interrupted by Arraka.<br/><br/>\"He's not lying...\" Arraka says, in a very grim tone of voice, sounding almost as if she were on her deathbed. \"I've been closely monitoring his aura all this time, and he's not lying. No, no, no, this can't be possible. Not him! Anyone but him! Come on!\"<br/><br/> \"Why are you being so affected by this?\" Illuna asks her. \"Like he said, it's just a simple technique. Even a regular person that can't cast any magic should be able to at least come up with a technique by themselves if they've read enough books, shouldn't they?\"<br/>\"It's not JUST a technique,\" Arraka says. \"Don't you get it? I've been alive for more than ten thousand years, and I still never came up with this idea. It was so simple, and yet somehow it never crossed my mind. And it wasn't for lack of trying, either. Do you have any idea how incredibly difficult it was to dispel a complex spell before the invention of this technique? Hell, I even started using it myself, because it was simply too good to pass up. But to find out that this technique was invented by Barry? All this time, I've been using a technique invented by BARRY? Oh gods, I think I'm going to be sick. I'm a spirit in an amulet but I feel like I need to puke. I can't-- I don't--Ugh--\"<br/><br/> Suddenly, Arraka starts making puking noises, even though it's obvious that she can't actually vomit in her incorporeal form. The others are still looking a bit confused, not knowing exactly how to react, except for Daren, who is looking rather impressed.<br/>\"Well, I'll be damned!\" Daren says, with a grin. \"The Brinhorn technique is actually what I used as a reference when I created most of the newer dispelling enchantments that are on my sword. But to think that Barry would be the one who I got the idea from... Come over here, you sly bastard!\"<br/><br/>He then comes closer to me and puts his right arm around my neck, while he closes his left hand into a fist, in order to rub his knuckles against the top of my head a few times, essentially giving me a noogie.<br/><br/>\"What else have you been hiding from us, huh?\" Daren says, still grinning, as he is giving me the noogie. \"Are we going to eventually find out that you used to be Azarius' mentor? Come on... Spit it out!\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, knock it off!\" I say, as I pull myself away from him. \"Listen, I didn't really think it was anything worth mentioning. It happened a few years ago, and I never really pursued a career in magical research after that, or anything. It's just an idea that I came up with on a whim, because Brinhorn and I needed to get out of a maze filled with magical traps. There's no reason to be making such a big deal out of it.\"<br/><br/>",

And to be perfectly honest, I don't think it was a fluke. I always thought it was weird that Barry-boy could figure out how Eiden's tricks worked after interacting so little with him, but now that I know what he's capable of, everything makes much more sense. I don't really care if this is some latent talent of his as a result of being half-lessathi, or if it's a direct result of his single-minded obsession of becoming a mage, or even if it's a little bit of both, but I'll be damned if I won't make full use of this. Change of plans, everyone! Barry is now officially our trump card. From now on, unlocking his magical stats takes full priority. I won't take 'no' for an answer. I want us to have a brainstorming session every single day, trying to figure out new ways in which we could get those two stats unlocked for him. Is that understood?\"<br/><br/> For the next half hour or so, at Arraka's request, we spent our time trying to come up with a different idea of how we could get my magical stats to work. I told everyone that Leila's father couldn't offer us any help on this matter, so we took it upon ourselves to try and come up with new and outlandish ways in which we might be able to acquire the code necessary for unlocking the stats. However, our initial enthusiasm didn't last for long, as we soon came to the realization that our pointless back and forth wasn't really helping us make any meaningful progress. <br/>\"Listen, Arraka,\" Daren says. \"We've already had this exact same exchange three times since we started this conversation. You know that we don't have any better options. Why can't we just stick with our original plan of trying to crack the code by using my enchanting tools?\"<br/><br/> \"Because it's going to take too long!\" Arraka says. \"The next trial could be coming any day, for all we know. We can't afford to waste all our time just unlocking some stats. We need to find a better and more effective way of cracking that code. That's why I've been busting my chops, trying to come up with an alternative plan for the past half of an hour!\"<br/>\"But we've already been over this a hundred times,\" Daren says. \"There is no other way. Can we not just focus on something we are actually able to do, instead of repeatedly trying to accomplish the impossible?\"<br/><br/>\"If that's the way you're going to think, then don't act surprised when that magic-less loser over there will shoot right past you and leave you in the dust,\" Arraka says. \"If there's one thing we can learn from that moron, it's that even the impossible can be achieved, if the amount of determination you have is high enough to be bordering on insanity.\"<br/><br/>\"I never thought I'd see the day when Arraka would give Barry an honest compliment,\" Hadrik says. \"Barry, it looks like you're moving up in the world!\"<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, we couldn't find enough separate rooms for each of you, so we had to give you a larger room instead. I hope this won't be too much of a problem for you.\"<br/><br/>\"Umm... I don't think so?...\" I say, as I look at the others, to see if anyone seems to be disagreeing with my statement. \"I mean, we've been sleeping in tents for most of our time in Varathia, so I don't really think any of us were expecting much comfort to begin with.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, that is a relief!\" Peter says. \"Would you like to take your backpacks to your room now?\"<br/><br/>\"Uhh...\" I say, as my teammates and I once again exchange a few looks. \"I think we'll be holding onto them for now, thanks!\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, alright!\" Peter says. \"In that case, could you tell me if there is anything else I could help you with?\"<br/><br/> \"Yes,\" Kate says. \"I am curious about something. Your 'king of the underground' told us earlier that you have listening devices within the palace, but how are you able to obtain the recordings? Isn't it a bit dangerous to go and retrieve them manually every time?\"<br/>\"There is actually no need for us to go and retrieve the recordings ourselves,\" Peter says. \"We have a room here in the underground where we have a direct connection to our listening devices, and we can hear what they are saying in the castle in real time. That is also where we make all the recordings.\"<br/><br/>\"But didn't you tell us earlier that the seredium walls and ceiling are preventing all of the magical waves and particles from reaching the surface?\" Kate says.<br/><br/>\"We did, but the recording room is different,\" Peter says. \"Here, let me take you there, and you'll see for yourselves.\"<br/><br/>\"Are you sure we're allowed inside there?...\" Leila writes. \"We wouldn't want to get in trouble with the king of the underground and his men.\"<br/><br/> \"Well, I know that I may not look like much, but I still have a little authority around here,\" Peter says. \"I am in fact one of the three founding members of the original resistance movement, together with Albert and Breynan. Even if we're mostly just following the king's orders nowadays, I still like to believe that we have a little bit of independence left. So you don't need to worry about getting in trouble with the king's men. If anything happens, I'll take full responsibility. And besides, we very rarely get to actually hear any of the conversations inside the palace, due to the relatively poor placement of our listening devices, so it's not like there are any real chances of you accidentally overhearing anything important while you're there.\"<br/>\"Well, in that case, lead the way, I suppose...\" I say.<br/><br/>\"The recording room is not very far from the room we are currently in,\" Peter says. \"Follow me.\"<br/><br/>As we all go after Peter, I notice that Hadrik has remained behind, on one of the chairs from the waiting room.<br/><br/>\"Hadrik, are you coming?\" I ask him.<br/><br/>",

After climbing the stairs for quite a while, we finally reach a trapdoor, and once Peter opens it for us, we make our way inside a room full of large metal devices, with lots of buttons and flashing lights on them. One guy was sitting on a chair in the middle of the room when we came in, playing with what appeared to be a virtual pet device, but he immediately put it in his back pocket when he saw us arrive.<br/><br/>\"Peter!\" the guy says, in a somewhat nervous tone. \"I wasn't expecting you here so soon. Is there anything I can help you with, or--\"<br/><br/> \"Relax, Bill,\" Peter says, as he closes the trapdoor once we're all inside the room. \"I'm not here to do an inspection, or anything. I just wanted to show our guests the room where we do our recordings. Anyway, as you can all see, the reason why we can connect to our listening devices from here is because this room is at a higher level of altitude than most of our underground base, so there is a much thinner layer of seredium above us. Unfortunately, we only have listening devices in the more desolate areas of the castle, because we didn't want to risk any of our men getting caught while they were planting them. As a result, we only very rarely get to hear any actual conversations, but when we do, we make sure to record them with the aid of all the machinery present in this room--\"<br/>\"Can you confirm that this is the area where you would like to have the conversation?\" I suddenly hear the metallic voice of a 'droon', coming from one of the large metal devices in our room.<br/><br/>\"Yes,\" I then hear Eiden's voice, coming from the same device. \"Over here, in this empty corner would be perfect.\"<br/><br/>\"Request acknowledged,\" the metal ball says. \"Please stand by.

How much do you know about what is going on in this city, exactly?\"<br/><br/>\"Question unclear,\" the Overseer says. \"Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol cannot provide you with a correct answer if your question is too vague. Please rephrase your previous query.\"<br/><br/>\"Is it really unclear, though?\" Eiden says. \"Or are you simply avoiding answering my question on purpose? As far as I am aware, your intelligence should go far beyond that of a simple machine... Surely, you must have at least some idea of what I'm talking about, shouldn't you?\"<br/><br/>\"The protocol does have a few theories regarding the intent behind your question,\" the Overseer says. \"However, it would be preferable if you provided more details, so that the answer would be more accurate.\"<br/><br/>\"In that case, I will give you a hint,\" Eiden says. \"I am referring to the more hidden aspects of how this city is being run. The kinds of things that are only known by the people in charge of this kingdom. The kinds of things that are of a... particularly questionable morality. Does that help you get a better understanding of what I mean?\"<br/><br/> \"Affirmative,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer has managed to narrow down the scope of your question, and it confirms that it does have ample knowledge about the 'hidden aspects' you have described.\"<br/>\"Then my next question is: what do you think about all of this?\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>\"Pardon?\" the Overseer says.<br/><br/>\"I'm asking about your opinion on the matter,\" Eiden says. \"Your point of view. Your stance. From what I can tell, your artificial intelligence protocol was created in a time when the lessathi prided themselves with their higher morality. Therefore, I cannot help but be curious about what a machine invented by them would have to say regarding the events occurring in a city like this. So, I am asking you again. What do you think about all of this?\"<br/><br/>\"The protocol's only purpose is to provide assistance--\" the Overseer says, but Eiden interrupts it.<br/><br/>\"You keep saying this, but the lessathi who built you are long dead,\" Eiden says. \"So, who exactly are you supposed to be assisting, I wonder?\"<br/><br/>\"Question unclear,\" the Overseer says. \"Please rephrase your query in a way that--\"<br/><br/>\"Why is it that you keep trying to avoid all of my questions?\" Eiden says. \"And why are you still pretending to be just some lowly machine, when we both know that this isn't who you truly are? Tell me, Overseer, what are you really after?\"<br/><br/> \"It appears that the Overseer protocol has not been able to properly assist you,\" the metallic voice says, this time in the more impersonal tone that it was using before activating the Overseer protocol. \"Unfortunately, this protocol is still experimental, and therefore may not always give you the exact guidance you require. Since this unit does not seem to be able to provide you with the information you requested, you are advised to contact one of the city guards instead, who will gladly help you with anything you might need. We apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day!\"<br/>\"So this is your answer, then...\" Eiden says, in a somewhat disappointed tone, as we can hear the propeller of the metal ball getting further away from the listening device.<br/><br/>A few seconds later, we also hear the sound of some footsteps, getting more and more muffled, as Eiden walks away from the listening device as well. <br/><br/>",

I quickly found out that most of the underground was split into several major sectors. First there was the living quarters, where people had their own private rooms in which they could sleep at night. Then, there was the mess hall, where the rebels and the king's men would go to eat their food. They also had an infirmary, and apparently a recreation area as well. I tried to venture outside of these major sectors too, but unfortunately a lot of those areas seemed to be off limits for outsiders like myself. <br/><br/> As I walked around the rebel base, I got to encounter several people that I'd already met before, such as the little girl who had lost her parents, and the two guys that dragged the sick old man to the quarantine zone. At a certain point, I also ran into Flower and Illuna, who were busy doing their training. Before they spotted me, I noticed that they were having an argument again. Apparently, Flower is still trying to imitate Kate's voice and demeanor, thinking that this would somehow make her sound more mature, and Illuna is getting increasingly more irritated by her behavior. When they noticed me, they stopped their fighting in order to greet me, but I'm willing to bet that they got right back into it as soon as I was out of earshot.<br/>While exploring the base, I had to go back to the waiting room several times, since it was situated right in the center of all the major sectors. At one point when I was in the waiting room, I ran into Daren and Arraka, who were apparently on their way to get some healing devices from the infirmary. When we saw each other, we stopped briefly so we could have a short chat about what we've been doing in the past few hours.<br/><br/>",

What about you? Did you find anything of interest while you were exploring?\"<br/>\"Not really,\" I say. \"I'm prohibited from visiting most of the important-looking areas, so I only got to see the kind of stuff that you would normally expect from a place like this.\"<br/><br/>\"Has Hadrik been like that ever since I entered the quarantine zone?\" Daren whispers to me, as he nods his head towards the dwarf, who is currently still sitting on the same chair as before, with a gloomy look on his face, while staring into the distance again.<br/><br/>\"Yeah, he hasn't moved from that spot, as far as I could tell,\" I say. \"I think his recent attitude must have something to do with what Gontrok said to him earlier about that dwarf village from 'all those years ago'. It seemed to me like the giant really struck a nerve when he said those words to Hadrik.\"<br/><br/>\"Do you think it might somehow be related to his trial from the God of Time's ritual?\" Daren says.<br/><br/>\"It's possible,\" I say. \"Either way, he's probably not going to tell us anything if we ask him directly.

After walking around and trying out different doors for about fifteen minutes, I stop for a brief moment, in order to decide where I'm planning to go next. As I am calmly looking around, I suddenly get a chill down my spine when I hear a man's voice coming from right behind me, even though I could have sworn that the corridor was completely empty only a few moments prior.<br/><br/>\"I noticed that you've been having quite a bit of fun exploring our rebel base, Barry,\" Albert says. \"See anything you like?\"<br/><br/>The way he was able to sneak up behind me so easily reminded me almost immediately of Wilhelm from the Thilias arena. As I turned to face Albert, my eyes instinctively went to the dagger that was hanging from his belt, and my suspicions were quickly confirmed when I saw the orange color of its hilt.<br/><br/> \"A fine dagger, isn't it?\" Albert says, when he sees me looking at his blade. \"You couldn't ask for a more perfect weapon as an assassin, honestly. If a regular person were to use it, then it would barely qualify as more than a kitchen knife, but we, assassins, are trained from a young age to make full use of its capabilities. The way it helps us focus when we are concealing our aura is simply extraordinary. Still, I couldn't help but get the feeling that this isn't the first time when you've been in a situation like this. Have you ever met an assassin up-close before, Barry?\"<br/>\"Yes...\" I say, as i try to calm down a little. \"There was an assassin in my division, when I was fighting in the arena of Thilias. His name was Wilhelm.\"<br/><br/>\"Wilhelm...\" Albert says, with a thoughtful look in his eyes. \"The name does sound familiar. I am quite sure that I've heard of an assassin who went by that name before, although I can't recall if I've ever had the honor to meet him. Were the two of you friends?\"<br/><br/>\"Not exactly,\" I say. \"He tried to kill me.\"<br/><br/>\"You were targeted by an assassin, and yet you somehow survived?\" Albert says, intrigued. \"How did you manage such a feat?\" <br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, there is no simple way to answer your question. Eiden has been masquerading as a tournament participant ever since the beginning, and he's interacted with several groups so far, including us. Sometimes he's helped us, and other times he has tried to kill us, so it's difficult to know for sure when he's acting as our ally or not. All we can say is that so far he's proved to be highly unpredictable.\"<br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, but I'm finding all this rather hard to believe,\" the king says. \"In my opinion, it would be a far more likely possibility that you and this 'Creator' are conspiring together, and you are simply trying to hide this fact from us...\"<br/><br/>\"No, we are not conspiring or anything!\" Daren says. \"The only reason why we came to this city is to kill the king of Ollendor. Believe me, we're all on the same side, here!\" <br/>  <br/>\"Are we really, though?\" Kate says all of a sudden, as she looks at the king directly, with an accusatory expression on her face.<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" the king asks her.<br/><br/> \"One would assume that an ally would not need to send their lapdog to keep an eye on us,\" Kate says, \"but your assassin friend Albert over there has been tailing us all day. I've also heard from Melindra that you've been conducting some rather shady business over the years, involving both assassinations and slave trades among other things. What is to say that those 'morally questionable' aspects of this society that Eiden was talking about with the Overseer in your recording weren't directly caused by you as well?\"<br/>\"A fair point,\" the king says. \"However, I would still like to point out that slave trading is not seen as morally reprehensible on this continent, regardless of how people may judge these things outside Varathia. As for the assassinations, there were definitely many of those that were executed on my orders, although I would argue that all of those deaths were beneficial to our society in one way or another. That being said, I cannot prove this to you any more than you can prove to me that you are not working with Eiden, so it is clear that there can no longer be any more progress made on this front.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what do you propose, then?\" Kate says.<br/><br/> \"My proposition is simple,\" the king says, with a smile. \"Instead of an alliance based on trust, we should try to form one based on necessity alone. What this means in practice is that both sides will be using each other as much as they can in order to fulfill their goals, but we will not abstain from backstabbing each other if it serves our interests. In other words, anything goes. Frankly, it seems to me that your group may have already been prepared for such a scenario. Isn't that the reason why you're all still carrying your backpacks with you, despite the fact that we've had a room prepared for you a good few hours ago?\"<br/>\"I suppose you're not entirely wrong...\" Daren says. \"But how are we going to deal with the Overseer meeting in that case? Does your initial offer still stand?\"<br/><br/>\"My men will still be assembling tomorrow, so they can have a talk with the Overseer,\" the king says. \"This has not changed. What you choose to do with this information, however, is entirely up to you.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" Daren says. \"Does this mean that the meeting is over, then? We can go back to what we were doing before?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" the king says. \"You can continue to roam free in these underground tunnels like before. I will even order Albert to stop trailing you, as a gesture of good faith. Oh, and Peter... next time when you get the idea to escort our guests to one of our restricted areas, be a good lad and inform me about it beforehand, will you?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes... your highness...\" Peter says, in a resigned tone.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes he helps us, and sometimes he tries to murder us in cold blood with a smile on his face. Even if it may look like he's helping us now, he could still just be messing with us in some way, and we're just not realizing it yet.\"   <br/><br/>\"I'm sorry, but I'm finding all this rather hard to believe,\" the king says. \"In my opinion, it would be a far more likely possibility that you and this 'Creator' are conspiring together, and you are simply trying to hide this fact from us...\"<br/><br/>\"No, we are not conspiring or anything!\" Daren says. \"The only reason why we came to this city is to kill the king of Ollendor. Believe me, we're all on the same side, here!\" <br/>  <br/>\"Are we really, though?\" Kate says all of a sudden, as she looks at the king directly, with an accusatory expression on her face.<br/><br/>\"What do you mean?\" the king asks her.<br/><br/> \"One would assume that an ally would not need to send their lapdog to keep an eye on us,\" Kate says, \"but your assassin friend Albert over there has been tailing us all day. I've also heard from Melindra that you've been conducting some rather shady business over the years, involving both assassinations and slave trades among other things. What is to say that those 'morally questionable' aspects of this society that Eiden was talking about with the Overseer in your recording weren't directly caused by you as well?\"<br/>\"A fair point,\" the king says. \"However, I would still like to point out that slave trading is not seen as morally reprehensible on this continent, regardless of how people may judge these things outside Varathia. As for the assassinations, there were definitely many of those that were executed on my orders, although I would argue that all of those deaths were beneficial to our society in one way or another. That being said, I cannot prove this to you any more than you can prove to me that you are not working with Eiden, so it is clear that there can no longer be any more progress made on this front.\"<br/><br/>\"So, what do you propose, then?\" Kate says.<br/><br/> \"My proposition is simple,\" the king says, with a smile. \"Instead of an alliance based on trust, we should try to form one based on necessity alone. What this means in practice is that both sides will be using each other as much as they can in order to fulfill their goals, but we will not abstain from backstabbing each other if it serves our interests. In other words, anything goes. Frankly, it seems to me that your group may have already been prepared for such a scenario. Isn't that the reason why you're all still carrying your backpacks with you, despite the fact that we've had a room prepared for you a good few hours ago?\"<br/>\"I suppose you're not entirely wrong...\" Daren says. \"But how are we going to deal with the Overseer meeting in that case? Does your initial offer still stand?\"<br/><br/>\"My men will still be assembling tomorrow, so they can have a talk with the Overseer,\" the king says. \"This has not changed. What you choose to do with this information, however, is entirely up to you.\"<br/><br/>\"Right,\" Daren says. \"Does this mean that the meeting is over, then? We can go back to what we were doing before?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course,\" the king says. \"You can continue to roam free in these underground tunnels like before. I will even order Albert to stop trailing you, as a gesture of good faith. Oh, and Peter... next time when you get the idea to escort our guests to one of our restricted areas, be a good lad and inform me about it beforehand, will you?\"<br/><br/>\"Yes... your highness...\" Peter says, in a resigned tone.<br/><br/>",
