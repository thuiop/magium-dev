 "Rose, listen to me," I say, as I place myself in front of her. "Arraka showed me your ritual. I know that it's going to be hard, but you'll need to--"
"It's not enough..." Rose says, all of a sudden, as she continues to look in front of her.

"What?..." I ask her, confused.

"Barry, it's not enough!" Rose says, as she finally looks me in the eyes. "Nothing that I've been doing so far in my life has been anywhere near enough. I can't just keep hiding behind my powerlessness anymore. I can't keep living like this. I need to do more!"

"What do you mean?" I say. "Do more for whom? The slaves?"

"Not only for the slaves..." Rose says. "But for everyone that I've ever ignored in my life, thinking that I couldn't make a difference. I can't close my eyes to their suffering anymore. I want to help them all!"

 "Rose," Daren says. "That's... very noble of you, but you need to understand that you can't help people just through good will alone. You've already been doing more than enough by collecting herbs and curing the sick people of Thilias. You even gave Ella a home to live in, knowing full well what risks you were exposing yourself to. You can't just blame yourself for the things that would be impossible for you to do. Nobody is expecting you to go on a quest to right the world's wrongs. You're not even a mage. You have no power to change the world in a more meaningful way than you've already been doing."
"Don't I?" Rose says. "Then what about this frozen world, all around us? Was this not my doing?"

"It only happened because of the prophecy," Daren says. "You know very well that you've never had any control over--"

Before Daren gets to finish what he was saying, Rose disappears from where she stands, and she reappears about a dozen feet away from her original position, with a victorious smile on her face.

 "Hey, that was not half-bad, herbalist girl," Melindra says, with an impressed smile. "Not half-bad."
"Rose, that was incredible!" Kate says, as her fatigued expression disappears from her face. "How did you do it?"

"I don't know," Rose says. "I feel... different. As if my head is being constantly flooded with information that I can barely process. I still can't use all my time powers, but everything feels so much more natural to me right now!"

"Hah!" Arraka says. "Don't get your hopes too high up, herbalist. This is only happening because you are still linked to the Magium. Once you'll be done with the prophecy, you will forget all about how to use these powers, and you will become the same boring, powerless girl as before."

"If I will forget how to use my powers, then I'll just have to learn them all over again," Rose says, with a very determined look in her eyes. "I will practice day and night, until I'll be able to use them perfectly. I don't want to go back to the way I was. This time, I want to make a real difference!"

 "Don't listen to Arraka," I tell Rose. "I'm sure you'll be able to master your powers in no time, with enough practice!"
"Thank you, Barry," Rose says, smiling. "I will try hard to make you all proud of me!"

"I don't mean to interrupt or anything," Melindra says, "but didn't you guys say that you were going to try and sabotage the ritual? Because if that's what you are planning to do, then you might want to hurry up a little. We don't know how long it will be until the next stage begins."

"You're right," Daren says. "And I think I might have an idea. Rose, could you try to unfreeze the time for the world around us by using your powers? It might just be enough to cancel the ritual."

"I don't know if I can, but I'll try," Rose says.

She then closes her eyes and tries to concentrate, as the rest of us fall completely silent, in order to avoid distracting her. After a while, Rose disappears from her spot, and she reappears several feet to the left of her original position. She then disappears and reappears again a few more times, in different places, until Daren finally decides to break the silence.

 "Rose, what are you doing?..." Daren asks.
"I'm trying to figure out how this works," Rose says. "I seem to be able to freeze you guys in time whenever I want, and the spell doesn't break, no matter how far I walk away from my original position. I can also unfreeze you at will, but no matter how many times I do it, the rest of the world still remains frozen. I don't understand. It's like the world around us was frozen in a completely different way than by using my powers."

"It was frozen with your powers," Melindra says. "But since you didn't do it consciously, you have no control over it. The reason why time was frozen was so that you could deliver your prophecy. Don't you remember what happened after you were put inside your trance?"

"I... do have some vague memories," Rose says. "I think what happened was that the time got frozen for everyone in the world, including you, immediately after I was put inside my trance, and then I walked all the way here, without stopping, for several days. It was only when I reached this place that I finally unfroze the time for all of you, so I could tell you the prophecy."

"Exactly," Melindra says. "It's all part of how these prophecies work. The God of Time may have found a way to sneak his own rituals in the middle, but that doesn't mean that you can just use your powers to unfreeze time completely."

"Hold on a second, there," Arraka says. "Rose, did you just say earlier that this was the first group you visited after you were put inside your trance?..."

"Yes, I'm sure of it," Rose says. "Why? Is that odd?"

 "Ahahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs all of a sudden. "So, you're telling me that these chumps are the ones who are the most likely to influence the prophecy? Ahahahahaha! That's it. Pack your bags, everyone. This continent is doomed!"
"What is she talking about?" Daren asks Melindra, as Arraka is still laughing in the background. "Why would we be the 'most likely' to influence the prophecy? Are there others who will be receiving the same prophecy after us?"

"Yes," Melindra says. "You are only the first group to be visited by the time weaver. Once the God of Time is done with his ritual, you will be frozen in time once more, and then the prophecy and the ritual will be repeated for other groups of people as well. Not only that, but this same prophecy will be delivered to you and the others at least two more times, before the events prophesized will come to pass, in order to announce you if any progress has been made, towards your goal of averting the disaster. The reason why Arraka said that you were the most likely ones to influence the prophecy is because the time weavers always visit their targets in order of priority, which means that your group may have the most decisive role in the events to come, depending on your choices."

 "I really think that you should consider things a bit more, before you choose to go on this path," I tell Rose. "Even if you manage to fully master your time powers, you will still be placing yourself in a lot of danger, by going through with this plan."
"I was hoping that you would be taking my side on this matter, Barry," Rose says, looking a little disappointed. "But I appreciate the fact that you are trying to look out for me. Don't worry, I'll make sure to not do anything too reckless!"

"I don't mean to interrupt or anything," Melindra says, "but didn't you guys say that you were going to try and sabotage the ritual? Because if that's what you are planning to do, then you might want to hurry up a little. We don't know how long it will be until the next stage begins."

"Out of all the people here, you were the last person I would have expected to criticize me about my recklessness, Barry," Rose says. "But to answer your question, no, I've already made up my mind, and I'm not going back on what I said. Even if it will take me years to do it, I will learn to control these powers, and then I will use them to change this world for the better."

 "Huh..." Daren says. "I'm not sure if I should be feeling reassured that we will be having a good chance of stopping the calamity, or worried that we'll likely be right in the middle of it, when it happens. Either way, we shouldn't be thinking about that now. What we should be focusing on is trying to interrupt the ritual. If Rose can't do it with her powers, then maybe it's time to take matters into our own hands. Hadrik, come with me for a second. I want you to help me take a look around, and see if we can spot something out of the ordinary."
"Alright," Hadrik says. "Lead the way."

"Did you really walk all the way here without any rest?" Flower asks Rose, worried, as Daren and Hadrik are moving away from us. "Aren't you tired? Don't you need to eat?"
      
"No, I'm fine... for some reason," Rose says. "I'm not hungry at all, and I'm not tired either. Actually I feel just as well rested as I was before leaving my home. I wonder if it's because of the trance..."

"Yeah, it's the trance," Arraka says. "You were basically put in a magical stasis for the duration of your walk, so that you wouldn't need any rest, food or water. If the God of Time hadn't intervened to pull you out of your trance prematurely, you probably wouldn't even have remembered that any of this had happened."

"Oh, I see," Rose says. "That explains it, then."

She pauses.

 "Uhm, Arraka," Rose continues, "you wouldn't happen to know if time weavers had any other powers than freezing and reversing time, would you?"
"So, you want to practice, huh?" Arraka says. "Well, I'm pretty sure that you should also have the ability to slow down time. From our perspective, it would look as if you were moving really fast, though. The advantage of slowing down time is that you can also interact with other people, while doing it. I think you might also be able to un-slow people from time, in the same way that you can unfreeze them from time, as long as they are somewhere near you, but I'm not completely sure if that comes as a time weaver power, or if it's just a really complex spell. Aside from these powers, I can't say that I'm aware of any others."

"Thank you!" Rose says. "I can't seem to be able to reverse time at all, but maybe I'll find a way to use that time-slowing spell you mentioned. Let me give it a try."

Not long after her conversation with Arraka, Rose begins to test her powers, while Kate and Flower are helping her with some indications. In the meantime, Daren and Hadrik are apparently still walking around, trying to see if they can find anything unusual that could help them spot a weakness in the ritual. As I am looking around, to see what everyone is doing, I suddenly realize that Leila hasn't participated in any of our discussions, so far, and she has barely even moved from her spot since the ritual started. At the moment, she is just looking at the ground, while avoiding making eye-contact with any of us.

 Could it be that she still didn't manage to get over what happened in her first trial? Come to think of it, she was also at the Beacon, so it wouldn't be too surprising if she got a similar ritual to that of Kate. That is not good... Kate might be strong enough to endure the emotional trauma caused by such a trial, but what about Leila? Maybe I should go talk to her, and see how she's holding out.
"Leila, is everything alright?" I say, as I get a little closer to her.

Leila looks surprised, when she hears my voice. I think she has gotten used to being ignored in these situations, due to her quiet nature and her generally weak sense of presence.

She raises her head, to look me in the eyes, and then she nods, slightly, in order to answer my question.

"I'm fine," Leila writes. "Just a little shaken up, that's all."

"Do you want to talk about it?..." I ask her.

Again, Leila looks at me surprised, for a second, but then she smiles faintly, as she writes a new text in the air, in front of me.

"Not now," Leila writes. "But maybe later..."

 Since Leila didn't really feel like talking at the moment, I decided to give her some space, so she could be alone, with her own thoughts.
As I went back to my original spot, I saw that Flower was now busy talking with Melindra, while Kate was still helping Rose with her tests. Apparently, Rose had already found a way to use her time-slowing powers, and now she was trying to see if she could un-slow Kate as well, so that she could benefit from the effects of her spell. I tried to help Rose too, but after spending more than fifteen minutes doing tests, it didn't look like we were making any progress.

"Wow, it sure has been a while since we finished our first trials," Daren says, after some time. "I wonder why it's taking so long for the second stage to start..."

"I'll tell you why," Arraka says. "It's because you shmucks gave Selkram so much raw material to work with in the first stage, that he's still busy converting it all into energy."

"What?..." Daren says.

"Your negative emotions!" Arraka says. "That's the raw material that Selkram is using to convert into magical energy. And while you losers were busy repeating those rituals over and over, sinking into the depths of despair or cursing the God of Time, you were giving him exactly what he wanted. Honestly, I think he got so much energy from you people, that he might not even NEED a second stage from your group. I guess we'll see about that soon enough."

 "Well, I'm happy to have been of assistance," Daren says, in a dry tone. "I suppose this gives us more time to investigate the area, then. Come on, Hadrik, let's try interacting with more of these frozen insects and trees. Maybe we'll be able to find one that isn't protected by an invisible, impenetrable shield, so we can finally cancel this damned time-freezing spell."
Shortly after Daren and Hadrik begin their new patrol of the area, we hear a familiar voice, screaming horrified, about a hundred feet away from us. When we all turn around to find out who the voice belonged to, we see Cutthroat Dave, with sweat all over his face, looking around him, confused, as he's trying to figure out what's going on. I suddenly realize that Cutthroat Dave must have been the person watching us invisibly from afar that Arraka and the God of Time were talking about, earlier. With all the crazy stuff that's been going on since the prophecy started, I had completely forgotten about him.

"Oh, so you were our invisible stalker!" Melindra says, with a smirk, as she casts a spell on the cutthroat, to lift him in the air. "Why don't you come over here, so we can see you a little better?"

She then makes the air currents slowly carry Cutthroat Dave towards our position, as he is struggling in vain to break himself free.

"Let me go, you wench!" Cutthroat Dave says, as he sends some of his knives to attack Melindra.

Melindra uses a wind spell to effortlessly deflect the knives, and then she continues to bring the cutthroat closer to us.

Although Daren and Hadrik got to patrol the area for quite a while longer, they didn't manage to find anything useful. Eventually, a bright white light covered our area once again, and this time, I could feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, instead of only my consciousness.

When the light fades away, we all find ourselves in the middle of a city which is... unusual, to say the least. The first thing that catches my attention is that there is one very large black tower in every corner of the city,  and on top of each of these four towers, there is an incredible amount of magical energy, that can be seen even with the naked eye. The energy has a purple color, and it is moving wildly in every direction, as if it were trying to escape its prison. On each side of these thousand foot tall towers, there are big, floating platforms, that keep going up and down at a slow speed, and they seem to be carrying hundreds of people towards the levels of the towers that they need to reach.

 Leaving these strange, tall buildings aside, what is even more peculiar is what's happening directly above us. Currently, there are hundreds of metal, horseless carriages, flying through the air, with people inside them. While these carriages are flying around, there are large holographic screens floating above us, picturing a man that is relaying the same message, over and over, in the Common language. The holographic screens look just like the ones that were created by Golmyck's illusion-casting device, when he announced our first objectives. The message that keeps getting repeated is: 'All non-lessathi citizens are to present themselves to the military reserve area immediately. We are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack!'.

I don't care if you look like her, or if you have her memories. You will never be anything other than an empty shell. You will never be anything like Rose. Do you understand? Never!"
The revenant seems to have been genuinely hurt by Daren's words. The expressionless look in her eyes has completely changed, and now it looks as if she wants to ask him a question, but she is hesitant to speak.

"Did... Suzie and Kevin really cry when they found out that--" the revenant starts to say, in a somewhat shaky voice, but Daren does not let her finish her sentence.

"Don't call them by their names!!!" he shouts, furiously. "You are not Rose! Don't pretend to be her! If you really cared about Rose and her siblings, then you would leave her body, so we could give her a proper burial, and that way, Suzie and Kevin would at least get to say their goodbyes."

"That is not something I can do," the revenant says, as she regains the previous expressionless look on her face. "I live to serve the God of Death. Only he may choose to end my life. Nobody else."

 "Then you are our enemy," Daren says, with a dark look in his eyes. "We've already seen what the God of Death's followers are capable of. There's no reason for us to think that your god would treat us any differently than the God of Time. There's no way we could ever trust you!"
"The God of Death has no quarrels with your group," the revenant says.

"But what if he did?" Daren asks. "What if he'd order you to kill us all, one by one. Would you do it?"

"If the God of Death would ask me to kill you, then I would do so without hesitation," the revenant says, without changing her expression at all, while she is talking. "It is not my place to question my master's orders, whatever they may be..." 

"Then you are too dangerous to be left alive," Daren says, as he begins to approach the revenant. "I will end your life here, before you have the chance to betray us."

 "Daren, wait!" Kate says. "You can't kill her. There is still a part of Rose that lives within her. You saw how she reacted earlier when you told her about Rose's siblings. Maybe there is still a way to turn her to our side. Maybe we can--"
"Rose is gone, Kate," Daren says, with a serious tone in his voice. "You can't keep living in the past forever. You need to let her go. It's what Rose would have wanted, if she were still alive."

"Rose would never have wanted you to kill this... person!" Kate says. "She would have wanted us to work together. You know this!"

"Sorry, Kate," Hadrik says, "but I'm going to have to agree with Daren on this one. We don't know what the God of Death is planning. For all we know, he may well be in cahoots with the God of Time, and they're still messing with our heads, as part of the ritual. We can't trust anything she says. We need to get rid of her, before she kills us first."

 As soon as Hadrik stops talking, Daren resumes his walk towards the revenant, with the sword in his hand, but before he gets to reach her, I place myself between the two of them, facing Daren.
"Barry, what do you think you're doing?" Daren asks, as he stops in front of me.

"What does it look like I'm doing?" I tell Daren, as I pull out my dagger.

"We're not seriously going to do this again, are we?" Daren says. "This isn't like that time with Illuna. The revenant literally said that she'll kill us with the first opportunity she has, if her god tells her to do it. She's a danger to us all. Why are you defending her?"

"She'll only be a danger to us if her god turns out to be our enemy," I say. "As it stands, we could really use her time powers right about now. Especially if the next stage of the ritual requires us to work as a group."

"If we'll need to work as a group, then there's all the more reason to deal with her now!" Daren says. "What is to say that she won't backstab us in the middle of the trial? We don't know her true intentions. And even if we knew for sure that she won't betray us this time, this may be the only opportunity we have to face her alone. What if the next time when she comes, she will have an entire team of mages, given to her by the God of Death to hunt us down?"

"But what if you fail to kill her?" I say. "What then? Do you realize that attacking her unprovoked would be akin to declaring war on the God of Death himself? Do you want us to have two gods as our enemies at the same time?"

 "We won't fail, if we all work together," Daren says.
"Daren is right," Hadrik says, as he comes closer to us. "Even those time spells of hers must have their limitations. If we all work together, we should be able to figure out what they are."

All of a sudden, a large ice wall forms itself in front of me, separating the revenant and me from Daren and Hadrik.

"How about we all calm down and take a break, before we do something really stupid?" Kate says, with an ice cold tone in her voice.

"I appreciate what you two are trying to do," the revenant says, as she steps away from me and goes to walk around the wall of ice, "but I assure you that it's not necessary. In fact, I think that Daren and Hadrik both need to experience the futility of their actions, before they'll be ready to work with me as a team. Please do not provide any help. I will fight them both myself."

"Those are some brave words," Hadrik says, with a grin. "Let's see if you've got what it takes to back them up."

 He then immediately rushes towards the revenant, at great speed, and tries to punch her, but she just disappears, right before he lands his strike, and she reappears much further away from him, while looking at him with her usual lack of human emotion in her eyes. Hadrik doesn't let himself get intimidated, and he tries to dash for her yet again, even though this yields him the same results. The third time, it is Daren who tries to slash at her with his sword, but she effortlessly evades his attack as well, by disappearing and reappearing, like the last two times.
"What the hell?..." Hadrik says. "How do you keep doing that? I thought that the time was already frozen!"

"It is frozen for the rest of the world, but not for you," the revenant says. "All I need is to freeze you in time along with the rest of the world, and then I'll have plenty of time to move out of your way before you get to land your blow. But these powers are not good only for defense. They are also very useful for offense. Like so."

She then disappears again, but this time, she reappears right behind Daren, holding a knife at his throat.

"Do you surrender, healer, or do we need to continue?" the revenant says.

}
#if(v_b2_ch11_defend == 0) {
 Instead of intervening, I choose to remain silent, and to let Daren and Hadrik handle the situation.
"Don't get any closer to her," Kate tells Daren, as he is still approaching the revenant. "I'm warning you!"

"What would you have me do?" Daren says, as he temporarily stops in his tracks and turns towards Kate. "Treat her as if she were our ally? You know I can't do that. Not after what she said."

"I'm just saying that we shouldn't attack her unprovoked," Kate says. "I see no reason to antagonize her and her god unless it is absolutely necessary."

"But this may be our only chance to fight her while she's alone!" Daren says. "What if the next time we meet her, she will have a whole army of undead, given to her by the God of Death to hunt us down? We can't risk that!"

"Daren is right," Hadrik says, as he approaches Daren. "If we're going to fight her, then this is our best chance. Even those time spells of hers must have their limitations. If we all work together, we should be able to figure out what they are."

All of a sudden, a large ice wall forms itself in front of Daren, separating him and Hadrik from the revenant.

 "How about we all calm down and take a break, before we do something really stupid?" Kate says, with an ice cold tone in her voice.

 "That's a pretty good bluff you have going there, revenant," Daren says, as he puts his sword in its scabbard, and then grabs the revenant's arm with both his hands, pressing her knife closer to his throat. "Unfortunately, as you can see, your knife is nowhere near sharp enough to be able to break even through my meager magical protection against physical attacks."
The revenant starts trying to pull her hand away from Daren, but he keeps a firm hold on it, with both his hands, as he continues his monologue.

"On the other hand," Daren says, "since you haven't disappeared from this spot already, it means that my instincts were correct, and you cannot escape someone's grasp, with the use of a time-freezing spell. You also don't seem to have the ability to reverse time at will, because if you did, you would have done so, already. In other words--"

Daren now pulls on the revenant's hand, lifting her on his back, and then he throws her to the ground, in front of him, while making sure that he still holds onto her, as firmly as possible.

"--you are now more vulnerable than ever," Daren continues his phrase from before, as he pulls out his sword from its scabbard, while still holding onto the revenant with his other hand.

He then slashes at her throat with one quick strike of his blade, and he severs her head from her shoulders, in a single movement.

"Daren..." Kate says, as she's almost about to cry. "What have you done?..."

 "I only did what I had to--" I hear Daren saying, but all of a sudden, everything in my mind becomes a complete blur, and then I get the very weird feeling that I've only just woken up from a dream.
Instead of seeing the revenant dead in front of my eyes, I get to witness the scene where she puts a dagger to Daren's throat for a second time, except now she does not wait for him to grab her, and she immediately jumps back, making sure that she is no longer anywhere near his range of attack.

What is happening, here? Did I seriously fall asleep in the middle of the battle and had a dream where Daren killed the revenant? Could I have gotten hit by a mind-affecting spell without noticing? I can clearly tell that this is the reality, and that what I saw earlier was only in my imagination, but why would I have had such a vision in a tense moment like this?   

"No..." Daren says, seemingly in a state of shock, as he points towards the revenant. "That's not possible. You were dead! I made sure of it. Even a revenant will die, if their head is cut clean off their shoulders. And yet, I saw with my own eyes how everything got reversed, just like that time when Arraka got out of the amulet! Who was it that reversed the time, if not you?"

 A time-reversal spell?... Of course! Now I understand why I felt like I woke up from a dream. The time was only reversed for Daren and the revenant, so they were the only ones who got to see all of the spell's effects. For the rest of us, who were not caught in the spell's area of effect, it was as if these events never even happened...
"The time did not get reversed as a result of a spell that I cast," the revenant says. "It got reversed thanks to a trait that all time weavers possess, which protects them from getting killed before they finish delivering their prophecy. No matter how many times I get killed, the time will always reverse itself up to a point where I am safe enough to escape from peril. This is why I said that your actions were futile. Even if I were to die, you still wouldn't get to kill me for good."

"You're lying!" Daren says. "If what you said were true, then how did Rose die? Why didn't the time reverse itself to save her, like it saved you?"

"The only reason why the time didn't get reversed for Rose was because of the revenant spell cast on her before she died," the revenant says. "The Magium does not care who gets to inhabit a time weaver's body, as long as it can still fulfill its purpose of delivering the prophecy. Given that I was already scheduled to take Rose's body after her death, there was no need for the time reversal spell to activate, so I became the time weaver, in her place."

"So... Rose would have still been alive, if it wasn't for you?..." Daren asks.

 "Daren..." Kate says, as she approaches him and the revenant. "It wasn't her fault. The God of Death's follower called Zack was the one who cast the spell. She wasn't the one who asked to be put in this body, nor was she the one who asked to serve the God of Death. We can't really blame her for any of this."
She then goes over to the revenant, and she grabs both her hands, gently, as she looks into her eyes.

"Listen," Kate says. "I'm not sure what to call you. 'Revenant' sounds too cold, but I am also aware that you are not the Rose I know. However, if there's anything of Rose left within you, like you said, then please, come travel with us. Forget about the God of Death. You don't need to let him control you any longer. We can try to hide from him together, or we could fight him, or... something. You don't have to go through all of this alone."

The revenant pulls her hands away from Kate, and she takes one step back, as her expressionless gaze momentarily turns into one of sadness and regret.

"I'm sorry," the revenant says. "I am not who you think I am. You should avoid trying to get any closer to me, for your own safety. I was not lying when I said that I would kill you in a heartbeat, if my master ordered me to. My loyalty towards the God of Death will always come first, and you need to understand that. If you put too much trust in me, you're only going to end up getting hurt. It is the Rose part of me that is warning you to stay away from me. Can you understand that?..."

 "Yes," Kate says, with a somewhat disappointed look in her eyes, as she takes a few steps back. "I understand. I won't try to meddle in your affairs anymore. And thank you for the warning..."
"So, what are we going to do now?" Hadrik says. "Work together, like nothing happened?"

"It doesn't seem like we have much of a choice," Daren says, reluctantly, as he sheaths his sword.

"What about the God of Death?" Melindra says, in a serious tone, while she has her arms crossed. "What are you going to tell him when you get back, revenant?"

"If he ever asks, then I will tell him the truth," the revenant says. "I will tell him that I was the one who started the battle, because I wanted to prove my superiority. That way, there should be no reason for him to bear any resentment towards your group."

"I see..." Melindra says.

"However," the revenant says, "I do not think that the God of Death will ask me anything upon my return. From his point of view, nothing will have happened, since time will remain frozen until I come back. He will likely continue to ignore me, just as he's been doing ever since I first contacted him, and I will be forced to keep waiting in one of his temples, until he sees fit to give me an order."

"He's ignoring you?" Kate asks. "But... why?"

 "The God of Death does not trust me," the revenant says. "He thinks that I am an undercover agent, sent by the God of Time to infiltrate his followers, and nothing that I've said has been able to change his mind on the matter. He even tried to kill me a few times, but he gave up after he saw that it was impossible to do so. Currently, I am not allowed to leave the temple that I entered when I first contacted him, and he is keeping me in the dark about most of his plans, out of fear that I might leak the information to the God of Time."
Arraka laughs.

"That does sound just like him!" she says. "Ulruk has always been very paranoid when it came to the God of Time. I can only imagine how shocked he was when he found a time weaver right on his doorstep, revenant or no. You'd better find yourself a hobby, because you're probably going to be sitting in that temple for a long time."

"Oh, those two have never really gotten along," Arraka says.

Obviously, Selkram is much too proud to ever stoop to such a level, but the God of Death has always been a bit of a nutcase, much like his own followers, so nobody managed to convince him that his fears have no basis in reality."

There's barely even any flow in her aura to speak of. Maybe there would be a chance to get a decent reading in those rare cases when she exhibits some form of emotion, but I wouldn't exactly bet money on that."

"Why not?" I ask.

"Because you refused to keep the communication channel between our two transceivers open, like I asked you to," the revenant says. "There was an important action that needed to be taken on your part right before the time-freeze, but I couldn't be too specific about it, because otherwise the God of Death might have overheard our conversation, and arrived to the conclusion that I was conspiring with the enemy. Either way, it's too late for that now. There is another way to find out the information we need, but it is less effective. Does anyone in this group have a particularly keen magical sense?"

"No," the revenant says. "If you try to activate it now, it will only take effect right after the time-freezing spell ends, and it won't be of any use to us. The temporary stat boost that gets activated with your secret code is entirely dependent upon a short magical timer, which won't set itself off as long as the world is frozen in time. However, if you had managed to activate it right before the time froze, the timer would have frozen as well, and it would have granted you extra hearing capabilities for the whole duration of this time-freezing spell."

"So, when you called me, the time wasn't frozen, yet?" I say.

 "No," the revenant says. "But I knew that it would freeze in a matter of seconds, because I had a few time-freezing spells go off without my control, right before I was put in the trance. Something similar to this also happened before the previous time I called you, except back then the time only froze once, without my control, and I was not put in a trance during that time, so I knew that it was only a small test, before the main event.

"Yes, that was the reason," the revenant says. "Like I said before, the spell that brought me into this world was designed to implant a lot of the God of Death's knowledge into my mind, and amongst that knowledge, there was also some information about the stat devices, and how they work. In short, the temporary stat boost that gets activated with your secret code is entirely dependent upon a brief timer which won't set itself off as long as the world is frozen in time. However, since you managed to activate it right before the time froze, the timer has frozen as well, thus granting you extra hearing capabilities for the whole duration of this time-freezing spell."

"So, when you called me, the time wasn't frozen, yet?" I say.

"No," the revenant says. "But I knew that it would freeze in a matter of seconds, because I had a few time-freezing spells go off without my control, right before I was put in the trance. Something similar to this also happened before the previous time I called you, except back then the time only froze once, without my control, and I was not put in a trance during that time, so I knew that it was only a small test, before the main event. This is why I asked you to keep your communications channel open, so that I could later tell you to activate the code, right before the prophecy started. Having the code activated isn't enough, though. In order for my plan to work, you would also need to have four points or more, already invested in hearing, so that together with the bonus points offered by the secret code, you would get a level of seven, in that stat. Do you have enough points?"

 "Yeah, I already have my hearing stat maxed," I say. "What do I need it for?"
"First of all, you're going to need to get as close as you can to the place where the God of Time first materialized into this world," the revenant says.

"Oh, okay," I say. "Melindra, can you--"

Before I even got to start my sentence, Melindra had already cast her magical air currents on me, which are now slowly raising me into the air.

"Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask," I say. "Thanks!"

I then raise my arms in the air, and I fly all the way up to where the God of Time was floating when he first made his appearance.

"Alright, I'm here," I say, as I stop in mid-air and turn towards the revenant. "Now what?"

 "No," I say. "Four is the maximum level I can have for a stat right now, and I haven't maxed my hearing just yet."
"If the maximum level for your hearing stat is four," the revenant says, "then the only way to go over that limit would have been to activate the secret code when you already had four points in your stat. Otherwise, even if you have available points to spend, the stat device won't let you manually add any extra points, over the maximum level of four. Sadly, it seems that we will need to go with my secondary plan. There is also another way to find out the information we need, but it is less effective. Does anyone in this group have a particularly keen magical sense?"

 As soon as the revenant finishes her sentence, we all turn towards Arraka's amulet.
"Arraka, will you--" Illuna starts to say, but she is interrupted.

"Yeah, yeah, I get it," Arraka says. "What do I need to do?"

"First of all, you're going to need to get as close as you can to the place where the God of Time first materialized into this world," the revenant says.

"I'm on it!" Flower says, as she jumps into the air and starts her fire jets.

She then flies all the way up to where the God of Time was floating when he first made his appearance, and she stops, turning her head towards the revenant.

"I'm here," Flower says. "Now what?"

 "Now I want you to focus hard, and to tell me if you can hear some very faint echoes, coming from that area," the revenant says. "Given that this is the place where the God of Time first made his link to the Magium, there should be a small, invisible rupture in space and time, through which it's possible to hear our own voices, coming from the future. You won't be able to hear them unless you block out all other sounds with your mind, and focus exclusively on those voices. Can you do it?"
"I'll try," I say.

"Take your time," the revenant says. "The second stage of the ritual is still a long way from beginning."

As I block all of the sounds around me and focus only on this small area, like the revenant said, I suddenly become aware of some barely audible voices, which are all talking at the same time. It's already difficult enough to actually hear the voices, but to also be able to make out what they are saying, I'm going to require a lot more concentration than this. I start to focus even further, until I'm able to separate what each person is saying. I manage to identify a few dialogues this way, but after a while, I get a very intense headache, and I am forced to stop.

"Is everything alright?..." the revenant asks me, as she sees me massaging my forehead, while I'm keeping my eyes closed.

"Yeah," I say, as I'm still trying to recover from the pain. "I just got a sudden headache, that's all."

 "If you needed to focus so hard that you got a headache, then you shouldn't force yourself any longer," the revenant says. "We wouldn't want you to faint of exhaustion in the middle of the ritual. Did you manage to find out anything useful?"
"Yes," I say, as I slowly stop massaging my forehead and open my eyes to look at her. "There was a woman whose voice I couldn't recognize, gloating about the fact that she had cast some sort of spell on you, to prevent you from concentrating on freezing time. That's about all the useful information I had time to gather, before the headache hit me."

"A spell that would prevent me from freezing time?" the revenant says. "It must be a dizziness spell of some sort. Does anyone here know how to cast any magical protections against dizziness?"

"Yes, I do," Illuna says. "However, I should warn you that this spell will also make you vulnerable to suggestion spells. Do you still want me to cast it on you?"

"If it's the only spell against dizziness that you have, then yes," the revenant says. "I'd rather protect myself against a known threat, than worry about a threat that may never come."

"Very well," Illuna says.

 She then points her palms towards her and says an incantation, as a white light surrounds the revenant for a few seconds, which then disappears almost as quickly as it appeared. In the meantime, I head back towards the ground, and as soon as I land, the air currents around me stop moving completely.
"It's done," Illuna says. "I finished casting the spell."

"Well, that's... something, I guess..." Daren says. "But I was hoping we could find some way to stop the next trial from happening altogether, instead of just gaining a small advantage. Revenant, couldn't you try to unfreeze the time for the world around us, and see if that cancels the ritual?"

 "Now Arraka is going to need to use her magical sense to see if she can detect some very faint echoes, coming from that area," the revenant says. "Given that this is the place where the God of Time first made his link to the Magium, there should be a small, invisible rupture in space and time, through which it's possible to hear our own voices, coming from the future. If Arraka inspects the area very closely with her magical sense, maybe she could make out some of the words being spoken, even if she doesn't actually hear them."
"Oh, I get it!" Arraka says. "Yeah, I can sense the rupture. And there are definitely some faint echoes coming from it. But they're all in a jumble, and hard to distinguish from one another. Let me see if I can figure something out."

We all wait, in complete silence, in order to make sure that we don't distract Arraka from what she's doing. After about half a minute, Arraka finally gives her verdict.

 "Yeah, there's no way for me to get any useful information out of there," Arraka says. "If there were only a few voices, then maybe I could handle it, but there are just too many of them, talking all over each other, constantly, and they're too faint for me to be able to make any clear distinctions, by using only my magical sense."
"Are you sure?" the revenant says. "There's still plenty of time left before the second stage of the ritual begins, so there's nothing stopping you from trying again."

"No, there's nothing I can do, no matter how hard I try," Arraka says. "If you want to sabotage the ritual, find some other way, because this isn't going to work."

"Isn't there some way in which we could stop the next trial from happening?" Daren asks the revenant, as Flower is now descending towards the ground. "Couldn't you try to unfreeze the time for the world around us, and see if that cancels the ritual?"

 "The time-freezing spell around us was cast without my control, so I can't undo it," the revenant says. "I'm not sure if you realized this, but the time got frozen long before I first appeared in front of you. Up until recently, your group has also been frozen in time, along with the rest of the world, while I've been in that trance, walking for days, until I managed to reach you. The time only got unfrozen for you when I was close enough to deliver the prophecy."
"Hold on, a second," Arraka says. "You're saying that this is the first group you've visited, since you entered your trance?"

"Yes, I'm quite certain of it," the revenant says. "Why do you ask?"

"Ahahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs all of a sudden. "So, you're telling me that these chumps are the ones who are the most likely to influence the prophecy? Ahahahahaha! That's it. Pack your bags, everyone. This continent is doomed!"

"What is she talking about?" Daren asks Melindra, as Arraka is still laughing in the background. "Why would we be the 'most likely' to influence the prophecy? Are there others who will be receiving the same prophecy after us?"

 "Yes," Melindra says. "You are only the first group to be visited by the time weaver. Once the God of Time is done with his ritual, you will be frozen in time once more, and then the prophecy and the ritual will be repeated for other groups of people as well. Not only that, but this same prophecy will be delivered to you and the others at least two more times, before the events prophesized will come to pass, in order to announce you if any progress has been made, towards your goal of averting the disaster. The reason why Arraka said that you were the most likely ones to influence the prophecy is because the time weavers always visit their targets in order of priority, which means that your group may have the most decisive role in the events to come, depending on your choices."
"Huh..." Daren says. "I'm not sure if I should be feeling reassured that we will be having a good chance of stopping the calamity, or worried that we'll likely be right in the middle of it, when it happens. Either way, we shouldn't be thinking about that now. What we should be focusing on is trying to interrupt the ritual. If the revenant doesn't have any more ideas, then maybe it's time to take matters into our own hands. Hadrik, come with me for a second. I want you to help me take a look around, and see if we can spot something out of the ordinary."

"Alright," Hadrik says. "Lead the way."

"Did you really walk all the way here without any rest?" Flower asks the revenant, worried, as Daren and Hadrik are moving away from us. "Aren't you tired? Don't you need to eat?"

 "I am undead, so I require neither food, nor rest," the revenant says, in her usual expressionless tone. "However, even if that were not the case, the trance that I was in earlier would have shielded me from any such problems. When you are inside the trance, your body is practically put in a magical stasis, of sorts, and all of your bodily functions are put on hold, until you are out of that stasis. If it weren't for the God of Time intervening in the middle of these prophecies, I probably wouldn't even have remembered that any of this has happened."
"Oh, I see..." Flower says, not being sure how to interpret the revenant's complete lack of emotion when talking to her. "Uh, sorry to have bothered you..."

The revenant looks at Flower, surprised, seemingly unable to understand why she apologized to her, all of a sudden. For a second there, it looked as if she were about to ask her what was wrong, but ultimately, she decided against it.

 "Hey, Flower," I say.
"Yeah?" Flower says.

"Just so you know, the revenant wasn't bothered by you, or anything," I say. "It's just the way she talks, due to being an undead. You should probably ignore her tone of voice altogether, if you want to avoid any more misunderstandings."

"Oh!" Flower says, as she suddenly turns towards the revenant. "Sorry! I thought you were mad at me for asking stupid questions. I didn't mean to upset you!"

"You did not upset me," the revenant says. "And you weren't asking stupid questions."

"Glad to hear it!" Flower says, with a smile.

She then approaches the revenant, and holds out her hand to her.

"Friends?" Flower asks her.

"I... already said earlier that if the God of Death were to order me to kill you, I would--"

"It doesn't matter," Flower says. "We can still be friends despite that fact! But only if you want to, of course..."

The revenant hesitates for a second, but then she slowly grabs Flower's hand, and she grips it firmly, as a sign of their newly formed friendship.

"Great!" Flower says. "Remember, friends always look out for each other! If you ever need my help, just call. Uh, unless you have been ordered to kill me or something..."

 "Thank you," the revenant says. "I will remember that."
After a while, Flower goes to talk to Melindra, while the rest of us remain behind, waiting in silence for the next stage of the ritual to begin. In the meantime, Daren and Hadrik are apparently still walking around, trying to see if they can find anything unusual that could help them spot a weakness in the ritual. As I am looking around, to see what everyone is doing, I suddenly realize that Leila hasn't participated in any of our discussions, so far, and she has barely even moved from her spot since the ritual started. At the moment, she is just looking at the ground, while avoiding making eye-contact with any of us.

Could it be that she still didn't manage to get over what happened in her first trial? Come to think of it, she was also at the Beacon, so it wouldn't be too surprising if she got a similar ritual to that of Kate. That is not good... Kate might be strong enough to endure the emotional trauma caused by such a trial, but what about Leila? Maybe I should go talk to her, and see how she's holding out.

 "Leila, is everything alright?" I say, as I get a little closer to her.
Leila looks surprised, when she hears my voice. I think she has gotten used to being ignored in these situations, due to her quiet nature and her generally weak sense of presence.

She raises her head, to look me in the eyes, and then she nods, slightly, in order to answer my question.

"I'm fine," Leila writes. "Just a little shaken up, that's all."

"Do you want to talk about it?..." I ask her.

Again, Leila looks at me surprised, for a second, but then she smiles faintly, as she writes a new text in the air, in front of me.

"Not now," Leila writes. "But maybe later..."

Since Leila didn't really feel like talking at the moment, I decided to give her some space, so she could be alone, with her own thoughts. As I was going back to my original spot, I saw the revenant displaying a bit of emotion in her eyes again, as she was preparing herself to ask Kate a question.

"I... have a question to ask," the revenant tells Kate, with hesitation in her voice. "What happened with Kevin and Suzie? Did you have to leave them at an orphanage, or--"

"No, we didn't need to do that," Kate says. "We left them with Enrique. He offered to move in with the children, after he found out about Rose's death, so he will be taking care of them, from now on."

 "Enrique..." the revenant says, as she seems to be recalling some distant memories. "Yes, Enrique is a good man... I'm sure he will take good care of the children. Thank you."
The feeling of anxiousness that could be seen in the revenant's eyes is now turning into one of relief. Those human emotions do not last long, however, because soon afterwards, the look in her eyes turns back to the empty, expressionless gaze that she had before.

"Wow, it sure has been a while since we finished our first trials," Daren says, after some time. "I wonder why it's taking so long for the second stage to start..."

"I'll tell you why," Arraka says. "It's because you shmucks gave Selkram so much raw material to work with in the first stage, that he's still busy converting it all into energy."

"What?..." Daren says.

"Your negative emotions!" Arraka says. "That's the raw material that Selkram is using to convert into magical energy. And while you losers were busy repeating those rituals over and over, sinking into the depths of despair or cursing the God of Time, you were giving him exactly what he wanted. Honestly, I think he got so much energy from you people, that he might not even NEED a second stage from your group. I guess we'll see about that soon enough."

 "Well, I'm happy to have been of assistance," Daren says, in a dry tone. "I suppose this gives us more time to investigate the area, then. Come on, Hadrik, let's try interacting with more of these frozen insects and trees. Maybe we'll be able to find one that isn't protected by an invisible, impenetrable shield, so we can finally cancel this damned time-freezing spell."
Shortly after Daren and Hadrik begin their new patrol of the area, we hear a familiar voice, screaming horrified, about a hundred feet away from us. When we all turn around to find out who the voice belonged to, we see Cutthroat Dave, with sweat all over his face, looking around him, confused, as he's trying to figure out what's going on. I suddenly realize that Cutthroat Dave must have been the person watching us invisibly from afar that Arraka and the God of Time were talking about, earlier. With all the crazy stuff that's been going on since the prophecy started, I had completely forgotten about him.

"Oh, so you were our invisible stalker!" Melindra says, with a smirk, as she casts a spell on the cutthroat, to lift him in the air. "Why don't you come over here, so we can see you a little better?"

She then makes the air currents slowly carry Cutthroat Dave towards our position, as he is struggling in vain to break himself free.

"Let me go, you wench!" Cutthroat Dave says, as he sends some of his knives to attack Melindra.

Melindra uses a wind spell to effortlessly deflect the knives, and then she continues to bring the cutthroat closer to us.

Maybe we'll be able to find one that isn't protected by an invisible, impenetrable shield, so we can finally cancel this damned time-freezing spell."
Although Daren and Hadrik got to patrol the area for quite a while longer, they didn't manage to find anything useful. Eventually, a bright white light covered our area once again, and this time, I could feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, instead of only my consciousness.

When the light fades away, we all find ourselves in the middle of a city which is... unusual, to say the least. The first thing that catches my attention is that there is one very large black tower in every corner of the city,  and on top of each of these four towers, there is an incredible amount of magical energy, that can be seen even with the naked eye. The energy has a purple color, and it is moving wildly in every direction, as if it were trying to escape its prison. On each side of these thousand foot tall towers, there are big, floating platforms, that keep going up and down at a slow speed, and they seem to be carrying hundreds of people towards the levels of the towers that they need to reach.

 Leaving these strange, tall buildings aside, what is even more peculiar is what's happening directly above us. Currently, there are hundreds of metal, horseless carriages, flying through the air, with people inside them. While these carriages are flying around, there are large holographic screens floating above us, picturing a man that is relaying the same message, over and over, in the Common language. The holographic screens look just like the ones that were created by Golmyck's illusion-casting device, when he announced our first objectives. The message that keeps getting repeated is: 'All non-lessathi citizens are to present themselves to the military reserve area immediately. We are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack!'.

 "Watch out!" Daren says. "Cutthroat Dave's knives have a life of their own. They're going to keep attacking you, even if you deflect them!"
"Oh, no!" Melindra says, in a sarcastic tone. "Whatever shall I do?"

She then casts a spell which surrounds each of the knives that were attacking her with their own magical air currents, making them stop and spin in mid-air, indefinitely. Cutthroat Dave keeps flailing his arms and legs around, in the air, in the hopes that he could break himself free from Melindra's spell, but eventually he reaches our position, and Melindra gives him a good long look, before she addresses him again.  

"Why are you so upset, cutthroat?" Melindra says. "Is it because you accidentally cancelled your invisibility spell when you panicked earlier? Or was your ritual really so terrifying that you still haven't gotten over it? How does a lowlife like you get access to such a sophisticated invisibility spell, anyway?"

"As if I'd be stupid enough to tell you where I got the elixir from," Cutthroat Dave says. "I'm way too smart for you to be playing your mind games with me, you understand?"

 "Oh, so it was an elixir that made you invisible!" Melindra says. "Interesting."
"He also had an expensive teleportation scroll, the last time we fought him, which he used to get away from us," Daren says. "I wouldn't be too surprised if he also had some other magical items, hidden in his pockets."

"Is that so?" Melindra says. "Let's find out what else he has, then!"

As soon as she stops talking, Melindra casts a spell which makes a few items float right out of the cutthroat's pockets, and into her hands. In her right hand, she is now holding a small flask, which is closed with a cork and has a green liquid inside, while in her left hand she is holding two furled scrolls that are likely single-use teleportation scrolls, like the one that the cutthroat had used before.

"You thieving whore!" Cutthroat Dave shouts, furiously, as Melindra makes the flask float in the air, in front of her, while she unfurls the scrolls, to take a quick look at them. "Give me back my items, or I promise that you'll end up full of holes!"

 "You promise?" Melindra says, as she stares at the cutthroat with a look of curiosity in her eyes. "I am intrigued. Do you not realize who you are threatening, right now? Or has this tournament completely robbed you of your common sense?"
"You think you can scare me?" Cutthroat Dave says. "Just because you're a stillwater? Your friend in armor over there was hailed as a legendary mage too, and that still didn't stop me from bringing him to his knees. What makes you think you're so special?"

"Wait," Arraka says. "The healer lost a fight against this weakling? Ahahahahahaha! That's one of the most hilarious things I've ever heard."

"Who are you calling a weakling, you crappy piece of jewelry?" Cutthroat Dave says.

"He called me a piece of jewelry!" Arraka says. "Ahahahahaha! This is too much! I can't take it anymore. Somebody make him shut up, or I'll end up dying of laughter!"

 "Hey, Melindra," I say. "Can I have those items?"
"Sure," Melindra says, as she hands me the scrolls and the elixir. "Knock yourself out."

The fact that she didn't think twice before giving me the items made me a little suspicious, so the first thing I did once I got them was to read what was written on the scrolls. As I suspected, the scrolls seem to be tailored specifically for the cutthroat, and they can't be cast by anyone other than him. I can't say much about the elixir, but considering how Cutthroat Dave went out of his way to get scrolls that would work only for him, I wouldn't be surprised if this green liquid acted in a similar manner.

Melindra gives me a smirk, when she sees that I'm done reading the scrolls.

"As you've probably figured out by now, those scrolls are completely useless to us," Melindra tells me. "The elixir might work, but I personally wouldn't risk it. Who knows what nasty side-effects it might have, if it were used by the wrong person?"

"Well, it's still better than nothing," I say. "I'll keep it for now."

I then put the flask inside my backpack, and I tear the teleportation scrolls into pieces, to make sure that the cutthroat won't be able to use them anymore.

 "You're all going to pay for this," Cutthroat Dave says, as he is looking at us, furiously. "You think you can just mess with Cutthroat Dave and get away with it? You're looking at the future winner of this tournament! You have no idea just how big of a mistake you've made."
"The future winner of the tournament?" Arraka says. "Damn! Barry, it looks like you've finally found yourself some worthy competition!"

"Shut up," I tell her.

"I think I've heard enough," Kate says, as she sends three ice cones straight for the cutthroat's face.

Cutthroat Dave reacts almost instantly, and he sends three of the knives that he had in his belt, to deflect the ice cones at the very last second.

She then tears both the teleportation scrolls into pieces, and she opens the flask, spilling all of its contents on the ground, as she smiles at the cutthroat, who is currently shaking with rage.

"What did you do that for?" Daren asks her. "We could have used those teleportation scrolls to get to Ollendor!"

"No, you couldn't," Melindra says. "They were both tailored specifically for the cutthroat, so that only he could use them. And that elixir of invisibility was likely made in a similar way. Those items would have been completely useless to us."

"Oh," Daren says. "Well, in that case, it's better that you got rid of them, I suppose..."

 "You're all going to pay for this," Cutthroat Dave says, as he is looking at us, furiously. "You think you can just mess with Cutthroat Dave and get away with it? You're looking at the future winner of this tournament! You have no idea just how big of a mistake you've made."

 Before Cutthroat Dave has the time to say any more words, Kate unleashes all of her ice cones, and two of them go right through his head, killing him instantly.
"So much for the cutthroat, I guess," Melindra says, as she drops his corpse on the ground.

"And good riddance, I say," Hadrik says. "We've wasted enough time with him as it is. Let's get back to work. We don't know how much time we have left."

After we were done with Cutthroat Dave, we all got back to what we were doing initially, but shortly afterwards, the area around us got covered in a bright white light again, and this time, I could feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, not just my consciousness.

"Why shouldn't I?" Kate says.

"He could still be useful, in the upcoming ritual," the revenant says. "Let me ask him a few questions."

"Ask your questions," Kate says, "but I'm not guaranteeing that I'll leave him alive afterwards. He might do more harm than good in the ritual, after all."

The revenant nods, and she approaches the cutthroat, so she can look directly in his eyes.

"Tell me, cutthroat," the revenant says, "why were you following this group, invisibly? Did someone send you here to spy on them?"

"Cutthroat Dave don't work for no one," the cutthroat says, in disgust. "I was following them invisibly, because I couldn't manage to get close enough to their camp this morning to slit their throats in their sleep!"

 "Why not?" the revenant asks.
"Cause the elixir I took didn't mask my aura completely, so I couldn't risk it!" Cutthroat Dave says. "I didn't think these bastards would have guards around their tents at all times. Since I'd already wasted my elixir for nothing, I figured I may as well follow them around until its effects were over, in the hopes that they'd leave their guards down at some point."

"But how did you find them in the first place?" the revenant says. "Who led you to their camp?"

"Woman, are you daft?" Cutthroat Dave says. "I told you I don't work for no one. I found them by accident. Nobody led me there. Now, tell your whore friend to put me down, so we can have ourselves a real fight--"

Just as the cutthroat was finishing his sentence, a bright white light covers our area, and this time, I can feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, instead of only my consciousness.

The flying carriages are moving in a frenzy, while people around us are all hurrying in the same direction, which I'm guessing is the way to the military reserve area. As if this wasn't already unsettling enough, I can't help but notice that the whole city is filled to the brim with dark blue banners, having a hawk holding the sun in its talons drawn on each of them.

Very shortly after being transported here, I also heard someone talking loudly in the lessathi language, through a magical voice magnifier, and the message he was transmitting was: 'Please stay clear of the eastern district. The lessathi high council are having an important meeting in the great hall, and do not want to be disturbed.'

I'm not really sure what kind of an attacker could make a whole city panic like this, but something tells me that we are about to find out, very soon.

"I can't believe this..." Melindra says, as she looks at the black towers in the distance. "Those towers coated in seredium dust look exactly like the kind of buildings the lessathi empire used to have thousands of years ago. I've only read about them in books. Even six hundred years ago, before the lessathi empire fell, you would not see something like this in their cities. The closest I've ever come to seeing anything resembling these towers was in Ollendor, where they are still preserving old relics from the lessathi empire's days of glory, but still, those were only ruins. For these towers to be in such good condition, we would need to have been sent back to when the lessathi empire was at its very peak. Four thousand, or even five thousand years ago! What is the God of Time thinking?"

 "Never mind the history lesson. Any idea who might be attacking the city?"
"A rogue city, perhaps?..." Melindra says. "The history of the lessathi empire hasn't been very well preserved, so I'm not sure if they had any conflicts between their own cities in the past. It's also possible that they might be getting attacked by some very powerful mages of their times. Maybe we'll get more details if we keep listening to their announcements."

}
#if(v_b2_ch11_towers == 1) {
 "Should I take it that we are still in Varathia, then?"
"Well, technically it wasn't named Varathia back then, but yes, we're on the same continent," Melindra says. "The Varathian towns from our present time have been built on the ruins of the old lessathi cities, and the only place where the lessathi ever had an empire was on this continent, so there's no doubt about it."

}
#if(v_b2_ch11_towers == 2) {
 "How do these towers work, exactly?"
"From what I know," Melindra says, "the energy from these towers was supposedly charged by mages from the city, who worked voluntarily every day to keep the energy alive, and who would receive monthly payments from the empire as a reward for their contributions to their society. This energy would then be used to power up these flying vehicles that you see above us, and also other technologically advanced devices that would make life easier for every citizen."

#if(v_ch4_spared_dave == 1 && v_ch11_saved_rose == 0) {
 "What the hell are you two talking about?..." Cutthroat Dave says, as he now seems to no longer be constrained by Melindra's air currents, and he is looking at all the flying carriages with apprehension in his eyes. "What is this place?"
"It's a city from the old lessathi empire!" Melindra says. "Haven't you been paying attention?"

"So, if we've been sent to the past again, does this mean that there are some events we have to repeat?..." Hadrik asks.

"No, this is a different type of ritual!" Arraka says. "Can't you see that you've been transported here with your bodies, instead of just your consciousness?"

"You're saying that this time we're allowed to change something that happened in the past?" Daren says.

"No, that's not what I'm saying," Arraka says. "The only way you can change the past is through a time reversal spell. This is obviously not our world. Neither of you were here five thousand years ago. We are in a parallel world, similar to ours, where the future hasn't happened yet. No matter what we change, here, it won't affect our reality."

"But then, what is the purpose of this trial?" Daren says.

"No idea," Arraka says. "But I do think I've managed to figure out why we've been sent here, of all places."

"What do you mean?" Illuna says.

 "Remember how in every one of the rituals so far, Selkram has sent you to relive events from your own pasts?" Arraka says. "Well, like I said before, neither of you have lived anywhere near long enough to have experienced these current events. So by process of elimination, the past that we are now exploring is most likely... mine."
Not long after Arraka is done talking, the whole sky gradually darkens, as a powerful, sinister aura envelops the area above us. The flying metal vehicles are now falling one by one, and crashing into the buildings below, while a woman in her late thirties is emerging from the dark clouds, and descending towards us. The robes she is wearing are similar to the traditional wizard robes that used to be worn hundreds of years ago, back when mages were still being called wizards, and that only traditionalist mages like Azarius are still wearing nowadays. As the woman gets closer to us, I see that her eyes are pitch black, and that she has a very familiar looking malicious grin on her face.

"Well, well, well..." the woman says, as she looks towards Arraka's amulet. "It looks like Selkram sent me a little present. You're all coming from the future, I presume? Let me check my future self's aura, for a second. Wow... So, you're five thousand years older than me, huh? I guess I must have gotten really senile with old age, if I managed to get myself captured in an amulet by a glorified circus troupe. Seriously, what even are you people? A little girl dressed like a clown? A giant masquerading as a dwarf?  A woman dressed in pajamas? It's like you're trying to compete for the most ridiculously dressed wizard group of the century."

 "I'm not dressed like a clown!" Flower shouts, all of a sudden. "These are acrobat clothes. Acrobat clothes! How is it so hard to tell the difference?"
"Aha- Ahahahahahaha!" the woman laughs, as her voice temporarily turns into the three female voices that Arraka always lets out, when she loses control over the way she speaks. "Acrobat clothes, she says! Oh, man, this would be so much funnier if it weren't so sad at the same time. Is this really where I'll end up in five thousand years? Trapped in an amulet, while I'm forced to play the role of some clown girl's pet? What kind of a cruel joke has my destiny played on me?"

"Shut up, you moron!" the Arraka from the amulet says. "This is your one chance to fix your pathetic past. I mean, your future. Don't blow it! Set me free from this amulet, and we can make all those self-proclaimed gods pay for banishing us to this realm. They might have beaten us alone, but together, we'll be unstoppable! We will kill every single one of the gods from this cheap copy of a world, and then we'll go back to my real world, and kill them all over again. Just break this amulet, and we will make a team so unbelievably powerful that even the Magium will tremble before us!"

 "The Magium?" the Arraka in the woman's body says. "Ahahahahaha! You're treating the Magium as if it were some sort of a person, now? What kind of an idiot have I turned into over the years?"
"Are you going to free me or not?" the Arraka in the amulet shouts.

"No," the Arraka from the past says, now adopting a more serious tone. "I am not going to free you. You might have forgotten this, due to your old age, but I haven't yet grown as senile as you. Do you seriously expect me to believe that once you get out of that amulet, you will seek to ally yourself with me? Don't make me laugh. I know exactly what you're thinking. As soon as you'll get out of there, the first thing you'll do is to attack me, since I am by far the biggest threat to your existence. And with all the knowledge you've been amassing in those five thousand years, you may as well end up beating me. Why would I take the risk? It's much easier for me to just leave you inside that amulet to rot, until I can find a way to get rid of you for good. You should blame yourself for having been stupid enough to get trapped in an amulet in the first place. I assure you that I will not be making that same mistake any time soon."

 "Oh, yeah?" the Arraka from the present says, furiously. "You want me to tell you what your future holds, you arrogant buffoon? I'll tell you what's going to happen. You're going to get trapped in a mountain for thousands of years, and all of your plans of vengeance will go down the drain. You're going to be even more useless than I am right now. At least in my current form I can cast a few spells. But you won't be able to do anything. For thousands of years! And you deserve everything that's coming to you! I hope you'll have fun in your new prison, you stubborn piece of trash!"
"A mountain, you say?..." past-Arraka says, with a grin. "How informative. So all I need to do in order to avoid your past mistakes is to stay clear of any mountains, then... Perhaps you're not so useless after all. Maybe I should snatch you away from that girl's neck, and make you into a pet of my own, so that you can tell me everything you've learned during your extra five thousand years of life."

"You wish you could do that, you worthless copy of a banshee," present-Arraka says. "When I'll be done with you, there won't be a single speck of dust left from your carcass!"

"How about you keep quiet for a second, while I quickly annihilate all of your friends?" past-Arraka says. "We'll have plenty of time to talk afterwards, when I'll be wearing you as a piece of jewelry around my neck."

We all rush out of the area where we were first transported into, and we look all around us, trying to find a house with black dust on its walls.

"Arraka, aren't there some houses in the vicinity that have walls you can't see through with your magical sense?" Illuna says.

"Huh?..." Arraka says, looking as if she's only now realized what we were trying to do. "Oh, right, let me check... Yeah, there is one. But it's pretty far from here. Take a left at the next crossroads, and go straight ahead. I'll tell you when to stop."

"Wouldn't it be faster for Melindra to fly us all the way there?" I say, as we keep running.

"No offense," Kate says, "but I think we can run faster than Melindra can carry us with her air currents."

"There aren't that many obstacles anyway," Arraka says. "It's just a long way until we get there."

"Where did that cutthroat run off to?" Daren says.

"He never came with us," Arraka says. "He ran in the opposite direction as soon as the time froze. That's probably a smart move. My past self will most certainly be coming for us, after all."

 As we keep running, the revenant suddenly gets a strong headache, which makes her lose control over her time-freezing spell. Once the time gets unfrozen, it unfortunately takes past-Arraka no longer than three seconds to teleport herself right in front of us, and to block our path.
"Such a shame," past-Arraka says. "You were so close to escaping. It's too bad that the time weaver couldn't hold on to the spell for just a little longer. Frankly, I'm surprised that she held out as much as she did. After all, the first thing I did when I arrived, earlier, was to cast a spell that prevented everyone in the area from using time powers. I'm guessing that she must have had a protection from dizziness of some sort? Well, no matter. In the end, it didn't help you in any way. The time weaver is too tired to concentrate now, so all you can do is--"

But the rest of us have been travelling with her for a long while. We know some of her secrets. We could trade you that information... in exchange for our freedom."
"You've got nerves of steel, trying to barter with me, I'll give you that," past-Arraka says, with her malicious grin back on her face. "But what kind of information could you possibly give me that I couldn't find out by myself?"

 "Well, there are certain events from your future that didn't exactly turn out the best for you," I say. "Wouldn't you rather have an edge, by knowing these things in advance? It costs us nothing to give you this information. This is not our world, after all. No matter what you choose to do in here, it will not affect us."
"Your offer would be much more tempting, if your real intentions weren't so transparent, boy," past-Arraka says. "I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to stall for time until your time weaver friend can use her powers to freeze me. It's not going to work. The first thing I did after I arrived in this place was to cast a spell that prevented everyone in the area from using time powers. I figured that one of you had to be a time weaver, given that Selkram was involved. Your friend over there has been trying to cast a time-freezing spell for the past minute, but she gets hit with a huge headache every time she begins to concentrate. Your desperate attempts to delay the inevitable have had no effect on your current situation. None, whatsoever--"

 "You won't be able to take us down that easily," I say, as I take out my dagger and begin to approach her.
"I'm not here to play games with you, boy," past-Arraka says. "If I want you dead... then you're dead."

She then waves her hand towards me, and I can feel every part of my body drying up quickly, as my vision starts to blur.

"Oh, and you can forget about trying to use your powers to save him, time weaver," I hear Arraka saying, as I'm slowly losing my consciousness. "The first thing I did when I arrived was to cast a spell that prevented everyone in the area from using time powers. Your friend is dead, and you will all follow him soon enough."

The last thing I get to see is Arraka waving her hand towards the others as well, and then I lose my consciousness completely, while I turn into dust.

TEXT: 

 An avalanche of flames coming from the right engulfs Arraka, just as she was finishing her speech, and we are forced to step back, because even the air surrounding those flames feels like it could melt off our skin. Arraka was clearly caught unaware, and she's trying to push back the flames with her hands, as she's struggling to keep hold of her magical shield. The whole ground below her is quickly turning into lava, while the banshee looks like she is getting slowly pushed back, by the incredible force of the magical flames that just keep on pouring. Eventually, she is forced to teleport away, fifty feet above her current location, which causes the flames to immediately stop.
Then, completely out of the blue, a familiar looking dragon made out of magma appears right next to us, and in the next second, we find ourselves being teleported away from the city streets, along with him. As we take a quick look around to see where the dragon Tyrath transported us, we realize that we are now situated in a large building with a very high ceiling, and from the looks of it, the whole construction surrounding us has been coated with seredium dust. The inside of the building looks like a big, closed, amphitheater, with rising rows of seats, and the illumination seems to be coming from magical devices, rather than torches.

 Judging by the size of the amphitheater, I'd say that it could probably fit around a thousand people or more in those seats, although currently there are only a few hundred of them sitting on the chairs, while they're murmuring and looking towards us. If I were to take a guess, based on the important looking clothing of these individuals, I'd wager that these must be the people ruling this city, who were in an emergency meeting discussing about the city being attacked, before we interrupted them.
Meanwhile, in the middle of the amphitheater, where the dragon and our group are currently standing, there are also quite a few human mages gathered, all dressed in traditional wizard clothing, along with a few women who are dressed in wizard robes as well. A particularly old man with a long white beard, who seems to be the person presiding over the meeting, is now addressing Tyrath from an elevated platform, speaking to him in a tone that is somehow both polite and condescending at the same time.

"Who are these... strangely dressed wizards that you've brought before the lessathi high council, king of all dragons?" the old man says. "I thought we'd made it clear that this meeting was supposed to be held behind closed doors. When we invited you into our great hall, we did not give you permission to bring guests as well."

 "Nobody asked for your permission, you old fool," Tyrath says, in disgust. "You know full well that I wouldn't be here if the situation weren't as dire as it was. This... powerful female wizard named Arraka, who claims to have come from another plane of existence is a threat to us all. I've fought her soon after she first made her appearance, yesterday, and I can assure you that she is not an enemy to be trifled with. My whole army of dragons was completely powerless before her. Only I was powerful enough to hold her back, but not enough to actually defeat her. You should already have an idea of the extent of her powers, now that she's attacked your city as well."
"If you know how dire the situation is, then why do you bring uninvited guests in the middle of this very important meeting?" the old lessathi says. "What benefit could they possibly bring to us, in such circumstances?"

"These people are not what they seem," Tyrath says. "I overheard Arraka saying that one of them was a time weaver, while I was making my way towards this hall. And if you look closely, you will see that the aura coming from that amulet around the little girl's neck is eerily similar to that of Arraka. So similar, in fact, that I would be tempted to say that the two of them are somehow the same person. The Arraka we know was about to kill them all, before I intervened. Surely, even someone as limited as you could see the advantage of having these people as our allies?"

 "But at what cost?!" another lessathi from the high council says, as he raises himself from his seat. "I've only just received word from my men through the transceiver, and they've told me that your downpour of flames from earlier has caused the deaths of more than a hundred civilians. Was it worth it to kill so many innocent people just to save this small group?"
"Even if my flames hadn't killed them, they would have most certainly gotten killed by Arraka a few moments later," Tyrath says. "Your civilians were practically already dead from the moment when she stepped foot in that area. There were hundreds of your flying metal vehicles crashed into the nearby houses when I arrived, and Arraka hadn't even started her rampage, yet. Every moment wasted arguing here will mean the death of a hundred more of your civilians, until we manage to put together a plan of attack that has some realistic chance of success."

"I will have to agree with Tyrath that arguing any further will get us nowhere," the old lessathi says. "Please sit down, councilman Hrelezar. We will be interrogating this strange group of wizards shortly, and we will soon find out whether the deaths of our fellow countrymen were worth it or not."

The lessathi man that stood up earlier is now reluctantly sitting back down, as the older lessathi addresses one of the women dressed in wizard robes.

"Olyrra, can you please continue where you left off, before we were interrupted?" the old lessathi says.

 "Yes, chairman Ezzeloff," the woman says. "As I've said, none of us have ever experienced anything like this before. Our magical powers have simply vanished, yesterday, and we found no way to bring them back. For some reason, only the women seem to be affected, but even some of our strongest female wizards have been reduced to simple commoners, in the course of a day. We've tried many methods to stimulate our magical auras, but none of them seem to work. If this doesn't get fixed, half of our elite wizard troops will be completely useless in the upcoming battle."
"This is grave news indeed," Ezzeloff says. "The female wizards from our elite troops were a force to be reckoned with. Our highest priority must be to find a way to bring their powers back, at all costs."

"Hah!" Arraka says, from her amulet. "You can try all you want. Your women are never getting their magic back."

"What are you talking about?" Ezzeloff says.

 "Didn't you find it strange that all your women lost their powers on the exact same day that the past version of myself made her appearance?" Arraka says. "Of course you didn't. You're morons. Well, let me spell it out for you. The reason why your women were able to cast magic until yesterday was because they were subconsciously linking themselves to female spirits from the magical plane. Since yesterday was obviously the day when I and all the other female spirits got banished from that plane of existence, their magic will never work anymore. You might as well give them some swords and shields to fight with, because that's the most you'll be able to get out of those troops from now on."
"You called the other Arraka a past version of yourself..." Tyrath says. "Does this mean that you're coming from the future?"

"Impressive, Tyrath!" Arraka says. "I never knew that you had mastered basic logic at such a young age. I guess that's why the other dragons made you their king."

"Spare me your insipid humor and answer me this," Tyrath says. "Why have you come here? Why were you fighting the Arraka from our time? Did you come here to avert some great crisis, or did you simply happen to arrive in this place by pure chance?"

 "Actually, we were sent here against our own will."
"Explain," Tyrath says.

"Well, do you know anything about the God of Time, and his rituals?" I say.

"I have very little interest in both the gods, and their occupations," Tyrath says. "Should I take it that this 'God of Time' is the one who sent you back here against your will?"

"Yes, exactly," I say.

"And now you are looking for a way to go back?" Tyrath says.

"Uh... I'd say that at the moment, our highest priority is probably our survival," I say.

"Then your best chance would be to cooperate with us," Tyrath says. "If you would share with us the information that you know from the future, we would be much better equipped to fight Arraka." 

"What kind of information are you looking for, exactly?" I ask him.

"I have a plan, which may well be our only real chance of defeating Arraka for good," Tyrath says. "I've been discussing it with the elite wizard troops since yesterday, after I first warned the high council that this place might be targeted by Arraka soon. Given that you are from the future, I would like to know if you've ever heard of such a plan being used in the past, and if it was successful. In short, there is a large mountain, not far from this area, which we could use to--"

 "I'm gonna stop you right there, Tyrath," Arraka says. "First of all, the good news is that in our past, you did use this plan on me, and you did manage to successfully trap me in that mountain for a few thousand years. Now, the bad news is that I may have... accidentally told the Arraka in your world all about your plan, which means that you may as well scrap the idea entirely, because it's completely useless, now."
"You did WHAT?!" Tyrath shouts loudly, as the magma from his scales erupts like a volcano.

Before Arraka gets a chance to answer him, a white light suddenly fills our entire area, and once again, we are transported back to our own world, which is apparently still frozen in time. As we're all looking at the forest around us, the God of Time materializes himself out of thin air once more, floating a few dozen feet above the ground, in front of us.

"I'm afraid that we'll have to continue this ritual some other time," the God of Time says, "since I've already reached my limit for how much energy I can gather from a single group. Do not worry, you will have the opportunity to continue this trial from where you left off, as soon as the time weaver will be sent to give you the prophecy again. I would like to say that you've all performed much better than I expected. You have my sincerest congratulations. "

 "Hah!" Arraka says. "I told you losers that you gave him exactly what he--"
"And your performance was the greatest of them all, Arraka," the God of Time interrupts her.

"What did you... just say?" Arraka asks.

"I wouldn't even have dared to imagine that you would contribute to my ritual out of your own free will," the God of Time says. "However, your feeling of pure dread at the thought of being completely erased from existence by the Magium was exactly what I needed for my ritual to be a complete success! I will be looking forward to what you will have in store for me, in the trials to come."

"You son of a--" Arraka starts to say, but she is cut off by the God of Time.

"Now, before I depart, I will ask you all to kneel before me one last time," the God of Time says.

 "Kneel?" Cutthroat Dave says, making us realize that he's also been transported out of the ritual, together with us. "Kneel?!"
He steps in front of us, so he can see the god closer.

"Cutthroat Dave kneels before no one," the cutthroat says.

"You will kneel before your god, or you will face the same treatment that the others have faced, the last time they defied me," the God of Time says.

When he hears what the God of Time had to say, Cutthroat Dave spits on the ground in front of him, in disgust.

"You are no god," Cutthroat Dave says. "All you are is an ugly-looking faceless bastard with too big of an ego. You're just like every mage that joined this tournament. You think you can just flaunt your magic powers in front of others, and expect them to bend to your will? How about you earn your respect instead of acting like it's your birth-given right? You can pretend that you're special all you want, but deep down, you'll always know what you really are: a worthless piece of shi--"

 Just as he was ending his sentence, Cutthroat Dave disappeared from before our eyes, and he was replaced by a faint, gray smoke that was now slowly raising itself into the air.
"What did you do to him?..." Kate asks.

"He will be spending some extra time in the world from your previous trial, as punishment for his transgressions," the God of Time says. "If he won't be dead by then, you will surely be meeting him again, when you will resume your ritual. Now, I will repeat myself one last time. Kneel."

 My friends and I exchange a few looks, but in the end, we all choose to stand our ground. Seeing that none of us are planning to kneel, Melindra starts slowly massaging her forehead, with her eyes closed, out of frustration. Since she knows that no matter what she does, the result will be the same, she decides to stand her ground as well, this time around.
"Have it your way, then," the God of Time says, as a powerful force pushes all of us except the revenant to the ground, in a horizontal position, and then he begins to slowly squash us, with the same magical force.

As I am being pushed against the soil, I start getting flashbacks of my first ritual, and of my parents begging me to save them, while I just stood there and watched, with the pitchfork in my hands. A sudden feeling of rage takes hold of me, and for the whole duration of the god's spell, a single thought goes through my head, over and over.

'I will make him pay.'

'I will make him pay.'

'I will make him pay.'

While we were still being pressed against the ground, the revenant's eyes suddenly became bright yellow again, and she slowly started walking away from us, while gazing into the distance, with an empty look in her eyes.

"It looks like our time is up," the God of Time says. "I will be seeing you all again, soon. Make sure not to get killed in the meantime. Your future contributions to my ritual are highly anticipated."

 Almost as soon as the god is done talking, he and the revenant simply disappear, and the world unfreezes itself, making it look almost as if nothing had happened. Now that there is no longer a force pushing us against the ground, we all get up and we dust ourselves off calmly, without saying anything. Not even a few seconds later, I hear the revenant's voice, coming from the transceiver in my pocket.
"What happened after I was gone?" the revenant says, in a low voice. "Did the God of Time pay you any more visits while the time was frozen?"

"No," I say. "From our point of view, it's only been a few seconds since you left. What about you? Do you remember anything after you walked away from here?"

"It's mostly just one big blur," the revenant says. "I remember that the people I visited right after you were Azarius and his pupil, but I don't know what happened after that."

"Alright," I say. "Are you going to keep your transceiver channel closed from now on, too?"

"Yes," the revenant says. "I am still being closely monitored, and I don't want to appear more suspicious than I already am. If there's ever anything urgent, I will call you from my end. Take care."

"You too," I say, and then the revenant closes her channel once again.

 "I... think we should all take a small break, so we can clear our minds a little," Daren says, with a very tired look on his face. "Shall we all meet back here in twenty minutes?"
"Yeah," Hadrik says. "I could use a break right about now."

As everyone goes to find a place where they can be alone, for a while, Daren goes to sit on a tree stump, and begins to sharpen his blade, in order to make himself look busy.

 My friends and I exchange a few looks, but in the end, we all choose to stand our ground. Seeing that none of us are planning to kneel, Melindra starts slowly massaging her forehead, with her eyes closed, out of frustration. Since she knows that no matter what she does, the result will be the same, she decides to stand her ground as well, this time around.
"Have it your way, then," the God of Time says, as a powerful force pushes all of us except Rose to the ground, in a horizontal position, and then he begins to slowly squash us, with the same magical force.

As I am being pushed against the soil, I start getting flashbacks of my first ritual, and of my parents begging me to save them, while I just stood there and watched, with the pitchfork in my hands. A sudden feeling of rage takes hold of me, and for the whole duration of the god's spell, a single thought goes through my head, over and over.

'I will make him pay.'

'I will make him pay.'

'I will make him pay.'

While we were still being pressed against the ground, Rose's eyes suddenly became bright yellow again, and she slowly started walking away from us, while gazing into the distance, with an empty look in her eyes.

"It looks like our time is up," the God of Time says. "I will be seeing you all again, soon. Make sure not to get killed in the meantime. Your future contributions to my ritual are highly anticipated."

 Almost as soon as the god is done talking, he and Rose simply disappear, and the world unfreezes itself, making it look almost as if nothing had happened. Now that there is no longer a force pushing us against the ground, we all get up and we dust ourselves off calmly, without saying anything. Not even a few seconds later, I hear Rose's voice, coming from the transceiver in my pocket.
"Is everyone alright?" Rose asks us. "Did anything else happen after I was gone?"

"No, nothing happened," I say, as I tap on my transceiver. "From our point of view, it's only been a few seconds since you left. What about you? Do you remember anything after you walked away from here?"

"It's... mostly just one big blur," Rose says. "I remember that the people I visited right after you were Azarius and Henry, but I don't know what happened after that."

"Alright," I say. "If anything out of the ordinary happens, don't forget to give us a call."

"I will," Rose says. "I have to go check on my siblings, now. We'll talk again later."

"Talk to you later," I say, and then I close the transceiver.

 "I... think we should all take a small break, so we can clear our minds a little," Daren says, with a very tired look on his face. "Shall we all meet back here in twenty minutes?"
"Yeah," Hadrik says. "I could use a break right about now."

As everyone goes to find a place where they can be alone, for a while, Daren goes to sit on a tree stump, and begins to sharpen his blade, in order to make himself look busy.

 "So..." I say, as I approach Daren. "What exactly are you planning to do after this 'break'?" 
"What do you mean?" Daren says, as he continues to sharpen his sword, without looking at me. "After the break, we'll continue to march towards Ollendor, like before. Isn't this what we set out to do, when we left Thilias?"

"Of course," I say. "But you know very well that this is not what I meant. When I asked what you were planning to do, I was thinking more in the long-term. I was talking about the God of Time, and the upcoming rituals he's threatened us with. What are you planning to do about those?"

"I don't know, Barry," Daren tells me, as he stops sharpening his sword and looks me in the eye. "You tell me. Because I'm not really seeing an obvious way out of this. The way I see it, all we can do is prepare ourselves the best we can for the next rituals, and hope that we can pass them, like we passed our last trials."

"Well, I was thinking that we could find a more... permanent solution to our problem," I say.

"Like what?" Daren says. "Kill the God of Time? Barry, be reasonable. We're talking about a literal god, here. We were having trouble even against a sage, not so long ago. What would you expect us to do against a god? We are nowhere near powerful enough to challenge him."

"That's funny," I say, "because you're nowhere near as powerful as Eiden either, and yet you kept challenging him again and again, every time we've met."

 "That's different!" Daren says. "Despite his power, Eiden is still a mage. We've all fought mages before. Some of them are more powerful than others, but you still have a general idea of what to expect when fighting one. But to challenge a god?... Barry, neither you nor I have even the slightest bit of experience in dealing with something like this."
"Then maybe we should ask someone who does," I say.

Before Daren gets to say anything else, I start walking towards Illuna, who was apparently having a discussion with Arraka. As I get closer to them, the two of them interrupt their conversation, waiting to see what I want.

"Arraka, I have a question to ask of you," I say, with a very serious tone in my voice.

"Uh, sure..." Arraka says. "Fire away."

"How do you kill a god?" I ask her, calmly.

 There is a short pause, after I ask my question, during which neither of us says anything.
"You want me to tell you how you can kill a god?..." Arraka says, as she seems to still be recovering from the shock of what I've just asked her.

She waits for a few more seconds, to try and figure out if I'm joking or not, and when she finally understands that I'm being serious, she starts to laugh. 

She laughs, and she laughs, as loud as she can, with all three of her voices, and it doesn't look like she's planning to stop anytime soon. However, I am not upset. This isn't one of her usual, mocking laughs. This laughter is one of excitement. She is enjoying this.

Arraka's laugh manages to grab the attention of everyone in the area, and they're now all looking at us, curiously. I pay them no mind, and I keep waiting patiently for Arraka to stop laughing. When she finally falls silent, she waits for a few more seconds, and then she gives me her answer.

"Barry, my boy..." Arraka says. "I thought you'd never ask!"
