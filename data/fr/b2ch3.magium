Illuna's friend was waiting for us in an area not far from the one where the trolls ambushed us. He was leaning on a wooden staff, with several dead trolls lying on the ground around him, and he was studying us closely, as we approached him. 

His appearance shocked me at first, but when I saw Illuna nod to him, I immediately realized that he was the one that she brought us to meet. Illuna's friend was no taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, a crooked nose, pointy ears, and green skin. 

I must admit that I wasn't expecting this friend of hers to be a goblin, but given the fact that Illuna is a banshee, I suppose that I shouldn't find it too strange that she'd have a few monster allies in Varathia. I've heard before that goblins are supposed to be really smart, compared to other monsters, but this goblin in particular has a very shrewd look about him, and his cunning grin reminds me of those slimy merchants that are constantly looking for new ways to rip you off. And he's not trying to hide it, either. 

 His high intelligence is likely a result of his old age, which I've heard is not an easy feat to achieve if you live your life as a goblin. Most goblins die young, either because of starvation, or because they get killed, while trying to steal food, in order to survive. Since they are considered monsters by other civilized races, they are forced to live from scraps, and often need to resort to illegal activities such as smuggling and stealing in order to get the goods they require. But this goblin's skin is all wrinkly, which means that he must have lived well over two hundred years, given how slowly goblins are known to age, compared to humans. Living this long as a goblin, especially in a place like Varathia, is definitely not something that you can achieve through sheer luck.

"Is this the lessathi you were talking about, Illuna?" the goblin says, in the Common language, as he looks towards me.

"Yes," Illuna says.

"And the lessathi girl?" the goblin asks. "Is she from your group too?"

"The lessathi girl is apparently a teammate from his arena division," Illuna says. "I only just met her, myself."

"Hmm..." the goblin says. "If she's a gladiator, then I suppose I can safely assume that she has nothing to do with Meridith's group. I'll admit that I was a little worried, at first."

"Hold on!" I say. "You're telling me that you can both tell she's a lessathi from just one glance?"

 "If your magical sense is sharp enough, you can tell the difference between a human and a lessathi with minimal effort, as long as you study their auras closely," Illuna says. "However, when you've dealt with as many lessathi as we have, it becomes second nature."

"Are you sure that these two can be trusted?" the goblin asks Illuna.

Illuna gives me one long look, before she answers the goblin.

"Barry is trustworthy enough," she says. "I don't know much about the girl, but I don't see any reason why she wouldn't agree with what we're planning to do. She is a gladiator, after all."

"Hey, wait a minute!" I tell Illuna. "If we're talking about trust, then the same question goes for him as well. Just how much are you willing to trust this guy? To me, he looks just about as trustworthy as a swindler who would try to trick you into playing a rigged game of cards, on the main streets of Bagelberry."

The goblin laughs out loud, after hearing what I had to say about him.

"I like this one," the goblin says. "He speaks exactly what's on his mind without making any effort to sugar-coat his words."

 "To answer your question, Barry," Illuna says, "I do not trust him at all. And he does not trust me, either. However, we are both smart enough to know that neither of us would benefit from betraying each other. The information he provides me with regarding the other monster races' activities is invaluable, and in return, I've been helping him from time to time, by ridding him of some of his enemies, or by joining him in covert missions such as this one."

"And what exactly is this covert mission that you are talking about?" I say.

"There is a minotaur being held here, in these tunnels," the goblin says. "They call him the undefeated champion of the arena. You are supposed to be fighting him in the second round, provided you survive the first one. I want to make him an offer."

"What offer?" I ask.

"I will offer him his freedom, if he agrees to join my goblin camp, and to be part of my army," the goblin says.

"You have an army?" I ask him, confused. "I thought you were just some random goblin that was acting as Illuna's informant."

The goblin laughs again.

"There really isn't any limit to your bluntness and disrespect, is there?" the goblin says.

"The goblin you are talking to is Fyron, the general of all free goblins," Illuna says, in a bored tone. "He is at the top of the hierarchy of all the goblins from Varathia that are not under Tyrath's rule."

 "Tyrath?" I ask. "You mean the dragon that I fought on my second day here?"

"The one and only," Illuna says.

"I am intrigued," Fyron says, as he strokes his chin, and he looks at me. "I can't say that I've heard of many beings that fought Tyrath and lived to tell the tale. How exactly did you manage to escape his wrath?"

 "Who said that I escaped?"

"So you managed to persuade him to let you go, then?" the goblin general says. "Or are you going to tell me that you defeated him all by yourself?"

"Not by himself," Illuna says. "He had help from a certain stillwater that I believe you are well acquainted with."

"You are talking about Eiden?" Fyron asks.

"Yes," Illuna says. "Eiden seems to have taken an odd interest in Barry and his group for whatever reason. I hear that the stillwater appeared out of nowhere in the middle of their battle with the dragon, and he powered up Barry's stat device in a way that allowed him to cast spells. This is the reason why Barry was able to fight Tyrath on equal terms."

"What you are telling me should be impossible," the goblin general says. "Unless the item itself is the one casting the spells, a lessathi should not be able to use magic by any means, because of the complete lack of magic in their aura. I did hear that the lessathi of old experimented with adding magical stats to the device a long time ago, but I am quite certain that they never managed to make it work. In order for someone to be able to cast spells by using those stats, they would need to have both the low magical frequency in their aura that is specific to the lessathi, and the potential to cast spells. They'd practically need to be both a lessathi and a--"

 The goblin stops talking suddenly, looking as if he'd just made a shocking realization. Seeing the look on his face, Arraka starts to laugh, from within her amulet.

"So you've finally figured it out, eh?" Arraka says.

"You knew?" Fyron asks her.

"I figured it out a while ago, after he started casting spells left and right, against a bunch of skeletons," Arraka says. "But I thought he was a regular lessathi too, at first. Eiden is probably the only one who knew it from the start."

"So that's why he's taken an interest in him..." Fyron says.

 "They're saying that you're a half-lessathi," Illuna says. "A half human, half lessathi to be more exact."

Upon hearing Illuna's words, Leila suddenly turns her head towards her, and she watches her attentively. This is the first time I've seen her react in any way, since the beginning of our conversation.

"A half-lessathi, you say..." I tell Illuna.

"It's the only possible explanation," Fyron says. "I don't know of any other races that look the way you do, and as long as you are also half human, your use of the magical stats makes sense."

"To be honest, I don't really care either way," I say. "Being a half-lessathi doesn't really make much of a difference to me. Besides, I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to use those magic stats that you are talking about. So far, I've only been able to use them for a very short period of time, and only after gaining access to a huge source of energy. That's not exactly ideal."

"There is a way to unlock those stats permanently," Fyron says. "However, doing so would require a code that is likely only known by a handful of lessathi, in the top brass of their organization. I wouldn't realistically expect you to get a use out of those stats any time soon."

 "So, uh," I say, "it's not that I'm not enjoying our conversation and everything, but shouldn't we maybe get moving, before the trolls send more reinforcements our way?"

"Why would they send any reinforcements?" Fyron asks. "I already took care of all their scouts."

He then gestures towards all the dead trolls lying on the ground around him.

"Nobody else should know that we're here," Fyron continues.

 "Speaking of the trolls," Arraka says, "are you guys going to hide these bodies any time soon, or are you planning on hanging them as decorations? Not that I'm against either of those ideas, of course."

"Can't you just wake up Flower, and have her incinerate the troll corpses?" I ask Illuna.

"I'd rather not wake up Flower unless it's absolutely necessary," Illuna says. "Stealth missions were never exactly her specialty, and she doesn't really get along with Fyron all that well, either."

"No need to worry," Fyron says. "I've got everything covered."

The goblin then smacks his staff into the ground, and all of the troll corpses get engulfed in flames, at the same time. After a few seconds, the flames disappear, and the dead bodies are replaced by ashes.

"Shall we proceed?" the goblin says.

"Arraka, are there any enemies in our way?" Illuna says.

"Nah," Arraka says. "You've already killed most of the guards from this area."

"And no one is hiding invisibly?" Illuna says.

"No one," Arraka says.

"Excuse me," Leila writes, as she looks at Illuna. "Did you just say that the banshee from the amulet is named Arraka?"

"Oh, so that's what she was doing!" Arraka says. 

"Can't you see the writing?" I ask her.

"No, I can't 'see' anything from inside here, are you stupid?" Arraka says. "I have no eyes. I can make out most things with my magical sense, so I don't really need my eyesight for anything important, but to me, the girl's drawings in the air were just magical particles, floating around at random.

"What the hell are you doing?!" Arraka shouts, while I spin her. "Show this to whom? Who were you even talking to? Has all the stress from this past week finally made you lose your mind?!" 

"What do you mean, who was I talking to?" I say, as I stop spinning the amulet. "I was talking to Leila."

"You really like to play with fire, don't you, Barry-boy?" Arraka says.

"As long as she stays in that amulet, she's not a threat to us," Illuna tells Leila. "Come on, let's get going. We've been standing in one place for long enough."

She pauses.

"But before that," she says, "I'm going to cast a few healing spells. Most of your wounds seem to be older than one day, and they're not severe, so I should have no trouble healing them completely. Barry, I have no idea if the blood on your clothes comes from your wounds, or from the trolls I killed earlier, but if you need healing, I'll tend to you afterwards."

 After Illuna is done with the healing, the goblin general takes the lead, and he guides us through an empty tunnel, on the opposite side of the tunnel we came in from.  

"That is quite an interesting method of communication you are using, young girl," Fyron says. "Judging by the way the magical particles are forming in the air, I would venture a guess that you are using some kind of modified version of a stat booster to transmit your messages, am I correct?"

Leila does not answer the goblin immediately, and she takes a few moments to look him in the eyes before she writes her response.

"I see that you are very knowledgeable when it comes to magical devices," Leila writes.

"I've fiddled around with a few artifacts and devices, including my staff, yes," Fyron says. "But nothing as complex as your translator. It must have taken a very thorough understanding of the ins and outs of mind reading magic and years of hard work to make something this sophisticated. Whoever worked on your device must have been very talented."

"He is," Leila writes, with a solemn look on her face.

"So, uh," I say, "why are you looking to invite the minotaur into your army? Are you planning to go to war against the dragon?"

 "How intriguing," the goblin general says. "You have absolutely nothing to gain from this information, yet you are casually asking me to divulge to you some of my most important military secrets without offering me anything in return. I know that you're not a spy, because no spy would be stupid enough to ask me something like this directly. So what is the reason behind this question, I wonder?"

"I believe this is what humans like to call 'small talk'," Illuna says, in her usual indifferent tone. "Empty words, with the sole purpose of engaging in a conversation, for no reason in particular. Barry is just particularly bad at being discreet, so he never stopped to think whether his question was appropriate or not, for this situation."

"Give me a break!" I say. "If you were so worried about me knowing your plans, then you would have never allowed me to find out about the minotaur in the first place. If you have any reason to think that I might somehow leak the information, then you can just tell me that you're looking to hire the minotaur as the army's accountant, and leave it at that. It's not like I can verify the information that you give me, anyway."

 "Ah, so you are not completely stupid after all," Fyron says, with a smirk. "That is a relief. Well, in that case, as you've said, the minotaur will be joining our accounting team as soon as he completes his training program. I am expecting great things from him in the months to come."

Arraka laughs.

"If I were you," she says, "I'd make the minotaur do the accounting anyway, just to mess with him. I hear that jobs that do not involve physical labor are considered to be the most dishonorable, by minotaur standards."

 "I'll keep that in mind," Fyron says, as he knocks on a wall with his staff, and a secret path opens up in front of us.

"You really know your way around these tunnels, huh?" I tell the goblin, as we all enter the hidden corridor.

"Fyron spends a lot of his time exploring hidden passages and underground ruins," Illuna says. "His hobbies are not much different from those of Flower in that regard."

"Now, now, Illuna," Fyron says, "there is no need to insult me like this. After all, isn't it due to my so-called hobby that we have managed to remain undetected thus far? I would appreciate it if you refrained from comparing me to your dimwitted companion over a small similarity such as this."

"Oh?" Illuna says. "Did you forget perhaps that it is thanks to my dimwitted companion that you were able to build that staff of yours? We would have never met in that cave twenty years ago if not for Flower's unrivaled stupidity."

"Aha- Ahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "I still remember your face when you woke up in the middle of that cave, surrounded by fire elementals! I can't believe that she actually fell for my bluff! Just thinking about it makes me burst into laughter!"

"Hello?" we hear a voice coming from a dark corridor to our right. "Is anyone there? Can you hear me?"

 We all stop suddenly, and we look towards the corridor, in an attempt to find the source of the sound. The voice seems to have come from the end of the tunnel, but it's much too dark to see anything clearly.

"If you can hear me, please, help!" the voice says, again. "I've been trapped here for months. I'll do anything you want! Please!"

"Hmm..." the goblin says, as he creates an orb of light with his staff, and then he makes it float all the way to the end of the tunnel.

Now that we get a clear look, we see that at the end of the corridor there is a locked cell, which holds only one prisoner: a tiger.

"Were you the one calling out to us earlier?" Fyron asks the tiger.

"Yes," the tiger answers him. "Please, let me out of here! I'll do whatever you ask!"

"Oh?" the goblin says, with a mocking smile. "Are you certain that it's a good idea to be addressing us in Common like this? I heard that the old fox is executing anyone who dares to speak in this language nowadays."

"The golden fox can go to hell and so can her rules!" the tiger shouts. "I'm never going back to that horrible place again!"

"You do not wish to return to the fox's domain?" Fyron says. "But what other place is there for animals like you? Who else is going to protect you, if not the spirit fox?"

The goblin grins.

"Let me see if I understand this fully," Fyron says. "From what you've hinted so far, I'm assuming that you'd abandoned the fox's domain long before you've been captured, am I correct?"

"Yes," the tiger says, with his head still lowered.

"Were there other animals captured alongside with you?" Fyron asks.

"No," the tiger says. "I've been living by myself, ever since I left the sacred woods."   

  "I see," Fyron says.

He then makes his orb of light float closer to the iron bars of the cell, and the light from the orb begins to fade.

"Hmm," Fyron says. "As I suspected, the cell you have been placed into restricts the use of magic. Should I take it that you are a mage, then?"

"I am," the tiger says.

The goblin grins again, and he turns his gaze towards me.

 The goblin laughs.

"Pay us no mind," he says. "We were only jesting. Although, you did say that you'd do anything I ask, so you should not act so surprised, even if I made you arrange desk papers for a living."

"I suppose..." the tiger says.

"Illuna, could you take care of those iron bars for me?" the goblin general says. "The anti-magic properties of the cell do not seem to spread beyond those bars, so you should be able to slice them with your water whips from the outside."

"Very well," Illuna says.

She then conjures two whips made out of water that she appears to be holding with her hands, and she uses them to slice the iron bars into pieces.

 "You are now free!" Fyron says, looking at the tiger that is now walking out of his cell. "And by this I mean that you are free to do my bidding. I really do hope that you are not planning to betray me and rejoin the fox immediately after we get out of this place."

"I assure you, that is not going to happen," the tiger says.

"Hmm?" the goblin says. "May I ask what it is that the fox has done in order to lose your loyalty to such a degree? Why would you still refuse to go back to your homeland, even after all this time has passed?"

"I have my reasons," the tiger says.

"See, that's not very reassuring," Fyron says, as he points towards the tiger with his staff. "If you're going to give me vague answers like that from the very beginning, what's to tell me that you didn't in fact make up that whole story about leaving the fox's domain, just to gain my sympathy?"

"No," Fyron says. "I simply took over."

"I'm sorry," the tiger says. "What was it you said you wanted me to do, again?..."

 The goblin laughs.

"Pay us no mind," he says. "We were only jesting. Although, you did say that you'd do anything I ask, so you should not act so surprised, even if I made you arrange desk papers for a living."

"I suppose..." the tiger says.

"Illuna, could you take care of those iron bars for me?" the goblin general says. "The anti-magic properties of the cell do not seem to spread beyond those bars, so you should be able to slice them with your water whips from the outside."

"Very well," Illuna says.

She then conjures two whips made out of water that she appears to be holding with her hands, and she uses them to slice the iron bars into pieces.

 "You are now free!" Fyron says, looking at the tiger that is now walking out of his cell. "And by this I mean that you are free to do my bidding. I really do hope that you are not planning to betray me and rejoin the fox immediately after we get out of this place."

"I assure you, that is not going to happen," the tiger says.

"Hmm?" the goblin says. "May I ask what it is that the fox has done in order to lose your loyalty to such a degree? Why would you still refuse to go back to your homeland, even after all this time has passed?"

"I have my reasons," the tiger says.

"See, that's not very reassuring," Fyron says, as he points towards the tiger with his staff. "If you're going to give me vague answers like that from the very beginning, what's to tell me that you didn't in fact make up that whole story about leaving the fox's domain, just to gain my sympathy?"

"Of course!" Fyron says. "Perhaps accountant isn't the right word to use in this situation. Maybe I should have said that I'm looking to have him work as a consultant, instead?"

"I'm sorry," the tiger says. "You want me to do what?..."

The goblin laughs.

 "The fact that I'm speaking to you in the Common language," the tiger says.

"Explain," Fyron says.

"Eleya, the great golden fox," the tiger says, "has a habit of interrogating all of the animals that return to her domain, after a long period of captivity. One question that is always asked is if you'd spoken to any humans in Common, while you were away. There is no way to hide the truth from the great fox. As long as she is studying your aura, she can easily tell if you are lying or not. Even if I weren't an exile, like I said, going back to my homeland now would be nothing short of suicide. She would execute me on the spot."

"I admit that I have heard of the fox's interrogations," Fyron says. "But I assumed that she would make an exception for mages, and for other valuable members of her community."

"The fox does not make exceptions," the tiger says, with a look in his eyes that seems to show both anger and terror at the same time. "I used to think the same as you, before she murdered the leopard's son in cold blood."

"The leopard?" I say. "You mean Leo, the leopard?"

"Yes, that is who I was referring to," the tiger says. "He was her most loyal retainer. He still is. But that did not stop her from executing his cub, for the heinous crime of begging for his life in Common, to a couple of human hunters. The leopard may have accepted her judgment, but I never will."

 The tiger pauses, for a few seconds, and then he repeats himself, in a lower voice.

"I never will," he says.

"Ah," Fyron says, "Now things are starting to make more sense. If the fox later also executed your family, in a similar manner to how she executed the leopard cub, I can see why you would choose to leave her domain forever. That would also explain why you left your homeland by yourself."

The tiger is looking pretty angry, after hearing the goblin's words, but he chooses to remain silent.

"You've said enough," Fyron tells the tiger. "At the very least, I would find it very unlikely that you would return to the golden fox after all you've just said. Regarding your debt to me, I ask only that you accompany me to my goblin camp on my way back. If the life there is not to your liking, then you may leave at any point, and consider your debt to me paid. I am, however, quite confident that you will choose to remain."

"And why is that?" the tiger asks.

"You will understand, once you get there," Fyron says. "Now, follow us. There is still another prisoner that we need to rescue before we can leave this place."

"Another prisoner?" the tiger asks, as he joins us, and we all resume our walk through the caves. "You don't mean the minotaur, do you?"

 "Who else could I mean?" Fyron says. "Is there anyone else here that would be worth the effort of releasing?"

"I suppose not," the tiger says. "The minotaur is likely the only prisoner from this place aside from me who is not some mindless beast."

"I'm curious," I say. "You say that all the creatures trapped in these caverns are mindless beasts, but I've also seen some sabre-toothed tigers on my way here. Do you feel the same way about them, too?"

"Of course I do," the tiger says. "What kind of question is this?"

"Well, they are tigers..." I say.

"No, they aren't!" the tiger says, furiously. "They are sabre-toothed tigers, not tigers! How can you even compare the two?"

"Barry is not from Varathia," Illuna says. "Believe it or not, in the continents outside of Varathia there isn't much of a difference between animals and creatures. A tiger from the Western continent is just as much of a mindless beast as a sabre-toothed tiger." 

 "You can't be serious!" the tiger says.

"On the contrary," Illuna says. "I am quite serious. I do not know if the high level of intelligence shown by the animals in Varathia is due to the golden fox's influence, or due to some other factors, but the fact of the matter is that Varathia is the only place in the world where animals can speak, and it is the only place where they live in civilized societies."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "How does it feel to know that there are animals out there who are dumber than ogres? Did you think that you were anything special? I'm willing to bet that people from outside of Varathia would not even be able to tell the difference between you and a wild beast. To them, you're nothing but a mindless creature, no different from a harpy, or a giant slug. Isn't that right, Barry?"

"Who the hell is that clown from the amulet?" the tiger says. "Some sort of prankster spirit?"

"That's rude, you know!" Arraka says. "You should not assume I'm a clown just because the girl wearing my amulet is dressed in clown clothes! Don't they teach you manners in animal school?"

"As unbelievable as it may sound," Illuna says, ignoring Arraka, "the banshee trapped in this amulet is the one responsible for the exile of all the banshees to the earthen plane. The gods didn't want to deal with her, so they banished her here, along with all her kind. Or so she claims."

 She does not get to finish what she had to say, because Illuna snaps the amulet shut in the middle of her sentence.

She then turns to me.

"Barry, do you and Leila have a means of returning to your cells?" Illuna says. "I think I should warn you that Fyron and I will be teleporting out of here as soon as we free the minotaur, so we won't be there to escort you back."

"No, we don't have a means of returning to our cells," I say. "The way we came is sealed shut and a hundred feet above the ground. We need to find another way back."

"If you're looking to reach the main corridors below the arena," Fyron says, "there's a secret tunnel that I can open for you, not far from where the minotaur is located. You might have to get past several traps, in order to reach your destination, however."

"That's... awful nice of you," I say. 

"Do not worry," Illuna says, seeing the mistrust on my face. "Fyron is not foolish enough to risk his alliance with me for no other reason than to amuse himself. He is not Arraka. If he says that there's a tunnel leading to the corridors below the arena, then he likely speaks the truth."

 "I see," I say. "Well, in that case, thanks, I guess..."

"There's no need to thank me, Barry," Fyron says. "I never help people for free. There may come a time when I will be in need of your help as well. If that time ever comes, I'd rather have you owe me a favor, than the other way around. That's all there is to it."

 "Fyron, is this the last tunnel before the labyrinth?" Illuna says.

"Yes," Fyron says. "The tunnel's exit should leave us very close to the maze's entrance."

"Wait, what maze?" I say.

"Do you know that old legend," Fyron says, "in which the gods worked together to build an elaborate maze for the sole purpose of trapping the king of the minotaurs? Well, it seems that the owner of the arena liked the story so much that he decided to build his own underground labyrinth, as soon as he got hold of a minotaur. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to visit these tunnels since the maze was created, so once we reach it, I won't know my way around as well as I have so far."

"I don't think that will be a problem," Illuna says, "since there will likely be no need to hide ourselves anymore, once we reach the maze. They will surely have caught on to our presence by then. I think we should be able to handle their guards by ourselves easily, but if worst comes to worst, I'll wake up Flower as well."

"I'm sorry, who is Flower?" Leila writes, confused.

"Flower is the little girl inhabiting this body," Illuna says.

 "You mean... she's still alive?" Leila writes, shocked. "But, aren't you a banshee? Didn't you consume her soul when you took over her body?"

Illuna laughs.

"If only it would have been that easy," she says. "Unfortunately, the two of us have been stuck together in this body for the past twenty years, and we'll likely continue living like this for years to come. Our souls are fused."

"I see..." Leila writes, simply.

She looks as if she'd still have some questions to ask, but ultimately she decides against it. As the tunnel's exit draws closer, Illuna reopens Arraka's amulet, and she asks her if she can spot any enemies nearby.

"Oh, so now you want me to talk?" Arraka says. "You're not going to close the amulet in my face anymore? Well, what if I don't want to talk? What do you say to that?"

"If you're not planning to talk, then I have no further need of you," Illuna says, as she starts to close back the amulet. "Have a good nap."

"Wait, wait, wait!" Arraka says, just as Illuna was about to close the amulet completely. "Okay, fine! You win! There are some trolls much further down the next tunnel, but they're not in viewing range of the maze's entrance. The coast is clear."

 "That doesn't sound right," Illuna says. "They should have at least some guards at the entrance of the labyrinth. I'm much more inclined to believe that they've become aware of our presence, and that they deliberately emptied the next tunnel, in order to lure us into the maze."

"That changes little," Fyron says. "The only way to reach the minotaur is through the maze. If the trolls choose to stand in our way, then we'll just have to make our way through them."

Once we reach the next corridor, we make sure that the coast is indeed clear, and then we proceed to enter the maze. The walls inside the labyrinth look a bit different from all the rocky walls that we've seen in the caverns so far. They are black as coal, and they appear to be made from a different material.

Fyron, who seems to have spotted the difference as well, gets closer to one of the walls, and he looks at it curiously. He swipes the wall briefly with his index finger, and then he brings the finger closer to his face, studying the black powder that has accumulated on the tip of it attentively.

"Tell me, Arraka," the goblin says, "are you sensing any trolls nearby?"

"What?" Arraka says. "No, I already told you that the coast is clear."

"Are you sure?" Fyron asks.

"What kind of question is that?" Arraka says. "Of course I'm sure!"

 "Oh?" Fyron says. "Then could you perhaps describe to me what lies beyond this black wall?"

"Yeah, hold on a sec," Arraka says.

For about ten seconds, we all wait silently for Arraka's answer.

"Well?" Fyron says. "Weren't you going to describe to us what's on the other side?"

"There's... a bit of interference," Arraka says. "I'm still working on it."

"Oh, then by all means," Fyron says, "do not let this old goblin's ramblings interrupt you from your work. Please, take all the time you need."

It takes thirty more seconds of silence until Illuna finally snaps.

"Good gods!" she shouts. "How long is it going to take you to admit the obvious? This wall is clearly made from a material that blocks magical sense. We can wait here all day, and you're still not going to get through it. Are you really that stubborn?"

"Fine!" Arraka says. "I admit it! I can't get through it. I have no idea what's on the other side. Are you happy now?"

 Fyron grins.

"Thank you, Arraka, I believe that will suffice," he says. "As Illuna noted, this wall is made from a material that does not allow magical sense to pass through. This type of black rock is not uncommon in underground caves such as this, and it is called 'seredium'. The owner of the arena must have chosen to build his labyrinth here specifically because of the existence of these rocks. There wouldn't be much point in making a labyrinth if people could just use their magical sense to see through walls, now would there?"

As the goblin was talking, Leila was busy inspecting the floor of the cave, with a very focused look on her face. Fyron notices her, and he goes closer, in an attempt to figure out what she is studying so attentively.

"Is there something special about this corridor's floor?" Fyron asks her. 

Leila nods. She then points towards a black spot on the ground, which is almost indistinguishable from the color of the rest of the floor.

 "This is no ordinary black stain," Leila writes. "It is troll blood. Look, there's more over there. And there as well. The trail is fresh. If we follow the drops of blood, they might just lead us to the minotaur."

"Or the trolls could very well be baiting us, so that we walk directly into their ambush!" the tiger says. "Since when do trolls leave blood trails, anyway? Don't they have regeneration powers that heal all of their wounds in a matter of seconds?"

"Not all of them," Illuna says. "The effectiveness of their regeneration varies from individual to individual. There are also certain types of wounds that heal slower than others. We have no way of knowing whether this trail was left deliberately or accidentally. Not that it matters, really. As long as we aim to reach the minotaur, we're going to run into the trolls sooner or later, whether we follow this trail or not."

 "In that case, I propose we follow the trail," I say. "If the trolls left it deliberately, then we'll have to fight them, like we were already planning to. But if they did it by accident, then at least we won't have to waste hours of our time navigating the labyrinth."

"A valid proposal," Fyron says. "Does anyone have any objections?"

"As I've said, it's all the same to me," Illuna says.

"Do what you want," the tiger says.

Leila remains silent, but she does not appear to want to make any objections.

"Very well, then," Fyron says. "We will pursue the blood trail. However, our first priority should be the mapping of this maze. Arraka, I understand that you have the ability to generate holograms?"

"Yeah," Arraka says. "But I can't make a map of this place if my magical sense can't pass through the walls."

"It doesn't matter," Fyron says. "You can just draw the map as we walk. What's important is that we don't lose track of where we are. I will be marking the walls periodically, as we advance through the maze, for that same purpose."

"Alright then," Arraka says. "Here goes."

 She then conjures a hologram similar to the one she made in the ogre stronghold, where we are represented by colored dots, and the map is covered by a black fog, except for the corridor that we are currently in. In the meantime, Fyron uses his staff to imprint a complex symbol on the wall to our right, in magical green ink.

As we walk, the fog from Arraka's map is beginning to clear, little by little, getting replaced by the parts of the maze that we already know, while Fyron is making sure that he leaves no wall unmarked.

"Are you the... intruders?" the troll says in Common, while breathing heavily.

"We are indeed," Fyron says.

"Please," the troll says, "could you help me... remove this arrow... from my chest?"

"And why would we do something like that?" Fyron says.

"You are... looking for the minotaur... yes?" the troll says. "If you help me... I can lead you to him. I know the way..."

As we advance through the corridors, I suddenly hear the voices of several trolls, talking in low voices, far away from our position.

The language they are communicating in is one that I haven't heard before, but luckily, the knowledge that I received from my stat device is enough for me to understand them.

"Please," says one of the trolls. "At least remove the arrow!"

"We'll remove the arrow from your wound as soon as you're done with your task," another troll says. "Now tell me, do you remember what you need to do?"

"Yes," the wounded troll says, while breathing heavily. "I need to... lure the intruders... and when they're near me... I press the button."

"Exactly," the other troll says. "And as soon as you press the button, we'll receive our signal, and we'll know that we can ambush the invaders. After we kill them all, you will receive your treatment."

"Yes..." the wounded troll says. "The treatment..."

 "Do not fail us like before," the other troll says, and after this last phrase, the corridors once again fall silent.

A few minutes later, we finally reached the end of the trail of blood, which led us to a dead-end, but also to a wounded troll with an arrow stuck in his chest, sitting on the ground, with his back leaning against a wall.

Illuna grabs me by the arm, in an attempt to stop me.

"Just what do you think you're doing?" she says.

"Calm down," I tell her. "I know what I'm doing. Don't you think I can handle one wounded troll by myself?"

Illuna frowns at me, but she lets me go.

"Don't say I didn't warn you," she says.

I approach the troll, and I kneel next to him, so I can properly remove the arrow from his chest. 

"Thank you... sir," the troll says. "You are... far too kind..."

As I focus on carefully removing the arrow, I notice, with the tail of my eye, that the troll is holding something in his hand, behind his back. 

"Barry, get back!" Illuna shouts, but it is too late.

Before I can react, the whole area around me explodes, and I barely get to understand what happened, before I lose my consciousness for good.

"No, wait!" the troll shouts, as he tries to get up, and he coughs some blood. "I can help you! Don't leave me like this! Come back!"

We all ignore the troll's desperate cries for help, and we begin to walk down a different corridor, while Fyron and Arraka resume their efforts to map the maze.

 Where are all the other trolls that you were talking to, earlier?"

The troll panics when he hears what I had to say, but he tries, in vain, to appear calm and collected.

"W-what other trolls?" the troll says. "I don't know what... you're talking about! I'm the only troll here. The others left me here to... die!"

"You are hiding something behind your back, aren't you?" I tell him. "Some sort of remote? I heard the other trolls telling you to press the button after you convince us to approach you."

"N-no!" the troll says. "You must have... misheard something!"

"You do realize that the remote they gave you is probably meant to trigger an explosion, don't you?" I tell him. "If they really wanted to ambush us, they wouldn't have needed a signal to know when to come. All they had to do was hide somewhere nearby."

"No, that's not true!" the troll shouts. "They would never do something like this!" 

 "They wouldn't?" I ask him. "What about that arrow in your chest, then? As far as I know, we should be the only intruders in these caverns. Who shot that arrow at you, if not the other trolls?"

"They said they would treat my wound if I... completed my task..." the troll says.

"Hey, if you trust your friends that much, then who am I to convince you otherwise!" I say. "Go ahead and press that button. Your cover has been blown, anyway, so you might as well use that signal to call your friends to help, right?"

The troll looks at me, helplessly, as he holds his thumb over the button, but in the end, he does not have the courage to press it, and he lowers his head, in defeat.

"I see that you've finally decided to stop deluding yourself," I tell him. "That's good. It means that now we might actually be able to work out a deal. How about it? You give me that remote of yours, and I'll remove the arrow for you. Then you can hold your promise of leading us to the minotaur. Sounds good?"

The troll makes no sound, for the next few seconds. 

"You speak to me as if I had a choice..." the troll says.

 "Well, if you've already made up your mind," I say, "then go ahead and throw that remote over here. I'll make sure to catch it without accidentally pressing the button."

"Take it," the troll says, as he throws his remote, and I catch it with both my hands. "I throw myself at your mercy..."

"Here, hold this," I tell Illuna, as I hand her the remote. "Meanwhile, I'll go remove that arrow."

"Keep the remote," Illuna says. "Removing the arrow will fix nothing. He's obviously been poisoned. Otherwise, he would have healed himself by now. Unless I cast a spell to remove the poison, he's not going to get up from there."

She then approaches the troll, and she carefully pulls the poisoned arrow out of his chest. Afterwards, she touches his wound with her hands, and a white light engulfs them both, as the poison is slowly being cleansed from the troll's body.

"Your wound is healed," Illuna tells the troll. "Although this could have all been avoided if you had bothered to drink a blasted anti-poison elixir before coming here. Is ten copper pieces really such a high sum to pay for a mercenary?"

"I... didn't think I'd need it..." the troll says.

 "Hmph, of course you didn't," Illuna says. "Get up. We've fulfilled our end of the bargain. It's time for you to fulfill yours."

"I will," the troll says, as he gets up and then takes the lead. "Follow me."

"Hold on," I say. 

"Oh, what is it now?" Illuna says.

"Hey, troll," I say, as I lift his remote in the air. "Watch this!"

I press the remote's button, and the area in which the troll was sitting earlier immediately gets covered in fire, as a loud explosion brings down the walls and the ceiling around it, eventually transforming the whole corridor into a big pile of rubble.

"I just wanted to make sure that you don't regret your decision of joining us," I tell the troll, as I look at the shocked expression on his face.

 "I understand..." the troll says.

"Did you really have to alert every single troll in this maze of our position?" Illuna asks me.

"Think positive!" I say. "The trolls who knew about the trap will now think that we're dead, which means that they will be coming here with their guards lowered. All according to plan!"

"Right..." Illuna says.

We begin to follow the troll, and as soon as we reach the end of the corridor, we all instinctively take a right turn, choosing the only path available to us.

"Wait, not that way!" the troll says.

"What do you mean, not this way?" the tiger says. "This way is the only way we can go! Don't tell me that you want us to go back?"

"It's not the only way," the troll says, and then he walks right through the wall on the left side, disappearing from our sight.

 "This is the correct path," we hear the troll's voice coming from beyond the wall. "Just walk through that wall. It is an illusion."

"I must admit that I would have never guessed it if you hadn't told me," Fyron says, as he touches the wall with his hand. "It even mimics the sensation to the touch, to a certain degree. At least, enough to make me not question its authenticity. I wonder how many of these fake walls I've marked on my way here, without even realizing it."

We all walk through the illusion wall, and we continue to follow the troll throughout the many twists and turns in the maze. As we take another right turn, Arraka's map seems to indicate that we are heading towards one of the already visited paths.

"Hey, wait up!" Arraka says. "That's not the right way. We've already been through that corridor once. Look at the map!"

"The fake walls are not the only illusions being used in this maze," the troll says. "There is a spell that affects your sense of direction, as well. I see that you've also been marking the walls, aside from drawing the map. I'm sure that you'll believe me when you'll see that the corridor I'm leading you to will be completely devoid of such markings."

 To our surprise, when we reached the corridor, we found out that the troll was not lying. The walls were indeed empty of markings, even if according to Arraka's map, this should have been a corridor that we'd visited before. 

"Damn it!" Arraka says. "What a waste of time this map turned out to be."

"The fake walls and the misdirection," the troll says, "are meant to keep intruders inside the maze long enough for our captain to come and finish them off. They're not expecting you to find your way to the minotaur, so his cell will likely only have a few guards posted in front of it. You shouldn't have much trouble freeing the minotaur, but I'm not sure how you're planning to get out alive afterwards."

"Oh, you don't need to worry about that," Fyron says. "We have our escape route covered. We also have room for one more passenger, if you feel like handing in your resignation."

"I... might just take you up on that offer," the troll says.

"May I ask for what reason the other trolls chose to turn against you?" Fyron asks him. 

 "I was the one guarding the entrance to the caverns," the troll says. "They blamed me for having let you inside, even though none of you ever went anywhere near the entrance."

"That makes sense," Fyron says, while rubbing his chin. "We would never have made it this far undetected, if any of the guards knew about the existence of the secret tunnels. How much further is it until the minotaur?"

"Not much further now," the troll says. "We need to take about three more turns."

When we got closer to our destination, we finally met a few more trolls, who were likely the ones chosen to guard the minotaur's cell. They barely got the time to react to our presence, before Illuna sliced their heads off, with her signature water whip.

"Aren't you going to burn the bodies?" I ask the goblin.

"I'm not wasting any more energy from my staff for something this trivial," Fyron says. "If you want, you can hide the bodies yourself. Not that it would make much of a difference at this point."

 We walked through the maze for about fifteen minutes without encountering any resistance. Along the way, we reached a few dead-ends, but Arraka marked them all on the map, so there would be no risk of running into them again. As we continued our journey through the maze, however, we ran into a situation that we had not predicted. 

Even though we'd been carefully following Arraka's map the whole time, somehow we ended up in the middle of a corridor that had already been marked with Fyron's green symbol. Dumbfounded, we all look at Arraka's map, in an attempt to understand what we missed, while Fyron carefully inspects his symbol from the wall.

"How is this possible?" Illuna says. "I've been closely monitoring Arraka's map while she was drawing it, and I am certain that it's accurate. According to the map, this should be an unexplored area. Did the trolls manage to falsify the green symbol?"

"It's not a copy," Fyron says. "My mark cannot be so easily reproduced. And aside from that, I also recognize this corridor. I can tell you with a certainty that we've been here before. Although I'm not exactly sure how we--"

As he is talking, a certain rock formation in one of the walls catches his eye, and it makes him stop mid-sentence. 

"Hmm..." he says, as he gets closer to the wall, and he taps it lightly with his staff.

"The goblin is not wrong," we hear a voice coming from a darker part of the corridor.

 As the one who just spoke gets closer to us, we see that he is a particularly bulky troll, wearing anti-magic armor from head to toe, and holding two scimitars in his hands. He is grinning triumphantly.

"You've been running in circles ever since you entered this maze," the troll says. "I knew that you'd be coming back to this corridor, soon."

"Psst," I whisper to Illuna, while the troll is giving us his victory speech. "Why aren't you killing him?"

"He is wearing anti-magic armor, and he has a helmet," Illuna whispers back to me.  "That means that I can't make my water sharp against him, so I won't be able to cut his head off with my water whips."

"Yeah, but isn't anti-magic armor basically just regular armor with some protections on it?" I whisper. "Can't you have Flower burn him alive?"

"There is no anti-magic armor in existence without protection from fire," Illuna whispers. "Casting fire magic on him would be pointless."

 While the two of us were whispering, hiding behind Leila and the tiger, the troll seemed to have finished his gloating, and was now preparing to attack.

"There is no way for you to escape," the troll says. "Resign yourselves to your fate. Today is the last day of--"

Leila appears to have had enough, as she makes a dash towards the troll, shocking him with her speed, and slashing his head right off with her dagger in an instant. Instead of dropping to the ground, however, the troll's body attacks her with the two scimitars, which Leila barely manages to avoid, by making a quick jump backwards.

"That's not how you begin a battle, human," the troll's head says, from the ground. "Attacking an enemy out of the blue without giving them proper warning is a mark of cowardice. Did they not teach you proper gladiator etiquette when they brought you to the arena?"

His body then picks up his head from the ground, and it places it back on top of its neck. Within seconds, the head attaches itself back to its body, making it look as if there had never been a wound in the first place.

 "A troll that doesn't die even when you cut his head off?" Fyron says. "This is not what I signed up for. Illuna, use the cage spell."

"I can only use that spell once per day," Illuna says. "If I use it now--"

"It doesn't matter," Fyron says. "You won't need to use it later. I have a plan. Cage him, now!"

Illuna frowns at him, but she does as he asked. She stretches her arm towards the troll, and out of nowhere, a golden cage appears around him, trapping him inside. It is the same spell that she used to trap us when we were at the ogre fort. The golden fox's spell.

 "Do you seriously think that a mere cage can stop me?" the troll says, as he begins slashing furiously at the cage's golden bars.

"Yes, we do," Fyron says, and he smacks his staff into the ground, generating a cloud of gray smoke that fills the entire corridor.

I then hear the sound of rocks moving to my right, and after that, I can see the outlines of my companions through the smoke, moving past me.

"Over here!" I hear Illuna's voice, as she grabs me by the arm and pulls me towards her.

I follow her through the smoke, and we both enter a narrow passage, leading to the other side of one of the walls. Once we are all through, Fyron smacks his staff into the cave's wall from the inside, and the hole in the wall closes itself back up. He then makes his way past us, to retake the lead, and he smacks his staff on the other end of the passage, opening another secret door, which leads us into an unexplored corridor, without any markings on the walls.

 "That cage isn't going to hold him for long," Illuna says, as we all make our way out of the passage, and the secret door closes itself behind us. "Would you mind telling me what this plan of yours is?"

"He doesn't need to be held for long," Fyron says, "I very much doubt that he knows about the existence of that secret passage, so he's not going to find us anytime soon. More importantly, I recognized that corridor from earlier, and I recognize this one as well. It seems that they've kept some of the old corridors, and included them in the labyrinth, when they built this place. If that's the case, then I think I have a pretty good idea of where we are, and the minotaur's cell should not be far from here. Follow me."

 "I've been meaning to ask," I tell Illuna. "Wasn't the golden cage from earlier one of the golden fox's spells? How did you manage to learn it?"

"It's not the fox's spell," Illuna says. "It is a complex spell that can only be used by beings that originate from the magical plane. I learned it from Arraka."

"I see..." I say.

"Hah, I was wondering why I didn't remember there being a wall on this side!" Fyron says.

As we turn to him, we see him walk straight through one of the walls, disappearing from our sights. 

"Come over here!" Fyron shouts, from the other side. "The wall is an illusion. This is how they must have been fooling us for so long. If they've got illusions like this set up, then I wouldn't put it past them to also have a spell cast on this place that messes with our sense of direction. That would explain why Arraka's map didn't help. It doesn't matter, though. If my intuition is correct, we should be almost there."

 We all walk through the illusory wall, and we continue our journey towards the minotaur. A few minutes later, when we were almost at our destination, we encountered a few more trolls, who were likely the ones chosen to guard the minotaur's cell. They barely got the time to react to our presence, before Illuna sliced their heads off, with her signature water whip.

 "Fine, I'll hide them by myself, then," I say.

"Suit yourself," Fyron says. "The minotaur's cell should be a little further down the corridor. You can find us there when you're done."

As the others head towards the minotaur, I prepare to lift one of the troll bodies, when I notice Leila walking to the other end of the corpse and then grabbing it by the legs.

"Oh," I say to her, when I understand what she is doing. "Thanks!"

She smiles at me, and then we both grab the troll's body and carry it over to a nearby secret passage. There's not much we can do about all the blood on the floor, but given the darkness of the corridor, at least it will be harder to notice from a distance than a bunch of corpses lying in plain sight. Once we're done moving all the bodies and the heads into the passage, we close the secret door, and we hurry to catch up with the others. Just as we approach them, Fyron uses his staff to cast a spell on a magical panel from a wall. The panel fizzles, and it unlocks the gate of a cell near it.

"Perfect," the goblin says, as he sees me and Leila approach. "You've arrived just in time!"

With the gate now open, the prisoner inside the cell steps outside. He has the head of a bull and the body of a man, but he is taller than Daren and has twice the muscles. The minotaur takes a quick glance towards us as he gets out, and then he turns towards the goblin.

We make our way towards the end of the corridor, where we find a single cell, with a magical panel on the wall beside it. Inside the cell, there is only one prisoner, with the head of a bull, and the body of a man, laying on the floor, with his back against the wall. The minotaur is taller than Daren, and he has twice the muscles. When he hears us arrive, he does not move an inch, and he doesn't even turn his head to look at us.

"Who are you?" the minotaur asks.

"I guess I was right when I figured that they'd place you in the old paralysis cell," Fyron says. "The maze's only purpose was to keep the intruders out, not to keep you in."

"Who are you?" the minotaur asks again.

"I am Fyron, the general of all free goblins in Varathia," Fyron says. "I've come here to recruit you to join my army. What do you say?"

"A goblin army?" the minotaur says.

 He laughs bitterly.

"I never thought I'd live to see the day," the minotaur says, "when I would actually seriously consider an offer like this." 

"It's not as bad as you might think," Fyron says. "At the very least, in our goblin camp you should have access to more food than here, and you wouldn't have to spend your days locked up in a paralysis cell. Or would you rather spend the rest of your life entertaining these humans?"

"This goblin army of yours..." the minotaur says. "Is it made only of goblins? Or have you also recruited other warriors such as myself to join it before?"

 "It is made mostly of goblins," Fyron says, "but our goblin camp accepts all races, as long as they follow our rules, and pay the yearly tribute."

"And how much is the yearly tribute?" the minotaur asks.

"It depends," Fyron says. "On average, it is about one copper piece for each goblin."

"Per year?" the minotaur asks, somewhat surprised.

"Per year," Fyron says. 

"And why is it that you are recruiting?" the minotaur asks. "Are you preparing for war?"

"That remains to be seen," Fyron says. "For the moment, let's just say that I like being cautious."

The minotaur pauses for a bit, to consider the goblin's words.

"We can negotiate the terms of your employment later, if you wish," Fyron says. "The last thing I would want is to force you into this, by taking advantage of your current situation. All I want is your word that you will take my offer seriously, and that you will join me on my trip back to the goblin camp. I know how much minotaurs value honor, so as long as you give me your word, that is enough for me. We can discuss the details afterwards."

 "You are clearly a skilled diplomat, goblin," the minotaur says. "You have a gift for finding the exact words that someone wants to hear, and you deliver them at just the right moment. Normally, my natural hatred for diplomats would make me not think twice before refusing your offer, but in this case, as you are well aware, I do not have much of a choice."

He pauses again.

"Very well, general Fyron," the minotaur says. "I give you my word. As long as you free me from here, I will accompany you to your goblin camp, and I will take your employment offer as seriously as I am able."

"That is all I wanted to hear," Fyron says, with a grin. 

He then uses his staff to cast a spell on the panel outside the cell, which deactivates the paralysis spell, and opens the gate.

He then turns to Illuna.

"Illuna," Fyron says. "Can you teleport the minotaur to the surface? As far as I know, your daily teleportation spell does not have a weight limit. Mine, on the other hand costs additional energy for every extra pound. I would rather you take the minotaur with you, since he is by far the heaviest of the group. I will be with you shortly, after I lead your friends to the secret passage I mentioned earlier."

Illuna nods, and the goblin now turns towards the minotaur. 

"Once you are on the surface, Illuna won't be able to help you," Fyron says. "Everyone in this city knows your face from the arena, so she can't be seen fighting alongside you, unless she wants to get a criminal record. Don't wait for us. As soon as you are out of the caverns, make a rush towards the city gates, smash right through them, and don't stop until you reach the Mertram woods. We will meet you there."

"I will be waiting," the minotaur says.

 "We should get going," Illuna says, and she grabs the minotaur's hand, in order to get ready for teleportation.

She gives us all one last look, stopping her gaze for a few seconds when her eyes meet mine.

"Don't die," she tells me, simply.

"I won't," I say.

She then casts her teleportation spell, and both her and the minotaur disappear from our sight.

He then stops by a wall, and he taps it lightly three times with his staff, causing a secret door to open up, and to reveal a hidden passage.

He then casts his spell, and he vanishes into thin air, alongside the tiger. Leila and I waste no time, and we enter the secret tunnel, as the door shuts itself behind us.

"Oh, there was one last thing I wanted to tell you," Fyron says, as he looks towards me. "A few days ago, four goblins that I'd exiled from my camp came back, with the two copper pieces that they required in order to pay the yearly tribute. When I asked them where they got the money from, they said that they got it from a scrawny human, who was travelling with a dark-skinned warrior dressed in heavy armor, and with two other women. They also said that the warrior had an 'X' shaped scar on his forehead. Since the warrior they were talking about is clearly the healer in armor, I can only assume that the scrawny human was you?"

 "Yeah, that was me," I say.

"Hmm..." Fyron says, giving me a curious look for a few seconds. "Well, the four goblins said that they were very eager to meet you again, so if you ever find your way into our goblin camp, be sure to drop by their house. I'm certain that they will be of help to you in one way or another."

"Sure thing," I say. "If I ever have business there, I will pay them a visit."

Fyron nods, and he prepares to cast his teleportation spell.

"Oh, I didn't mean it in a bad way," Leila writes. "It's just that I wasn't expecting to meet two banshees and a goblin mage in the same day."

"Well, to be fair, I can't say that I was expecting the goblin, either," I say. "But after the time I've spent here, in Varathia, nothing really surprises me anymore."

I pause for a few seconds, and then I change the subject.

"So, uh... why didn't you accept the goblin's offer, earlier?" I ask her. "Is it because you didn't trust him?"  

"Oh, no, it's not that," Leila writes. "It's just that I never intended to break out of here."

"Why not?" I say. "Couldn't you just run past all the guards in the city, now that your wounds are healed?"

Leila shakes her head.

"The lessathi that framed my father are watching me carefully," she writes. "As long as I survive the arena, the charges against me will be dropped, and they won't be able to touch me, but if I escape illegally, they will use all of the means at their disposal to hunt me down. I would never make it to the city gates alive."

 "You are saying that you'd rather fight the creatures from the arena," I say, "than have a direct confrontation with the lessathi from this city?"

"Yes," Leila writes. "The lessathi have powerful artifacts that allow them to use magic, similar to the staff that the goblin general was using. At least in the arena nobody is allowed to use magic, so as long as I have my stat device, I can stand a chance."

"Yeah, I guess I see your point," I say. "Speaking of stat devices, I think we should pull them out to light this place up a bit. The goblin did say that there might be traps around here, so we should watch our step."

We walk down the dark tunnel for a few minutes, carefully checking every step of the way for traps, or enemy ambushes. As we step into a larger area, lit by the glowing blue crystals that we've seen before, we realize that all of our efforts to spot hidden ambushes have been wasted, because the enemy was waiting for us here, in this very room, without making any effort at hiding themselves.

 A single troll stands between us and freedom. Unfortunately for us, it is the troll that we would have wanted to meet the least. It is the one that we managed to avoid earlier, thanks to Illuna's golden cage spell. However, Illuna is not here now, and our chances of survival are looking slim.

The bulky troll grins triumphantly at us, like before, and he announces his presence by speaking as loudly as possible.

"Did you really think that you could get away that easily, after all you've done?" the troll says. "Unfortunately for you, the existence of this passage was never a secret to us. As soon as you triggered the alarm by freeing the minotaur from his cell, I knew at once that you would try to use this tunnel to escape! Now tell me, where is the minotaur?"

 "He's gone," I tell him. "He teleported away with our friends. I doubt you'll ever see him again."

"You are lying!" the troll shouts, furiously. "You would have never went through the trouble of navigating the maze, if you could have just teleported in and out at your leisure. And if your friends really did teleport out of here, then they would have surely taken you with them. If you're not going to tell me where the minotaur is, then I will just have to walk over your dead bodies, and search him for myself. You should know by now that you stand no chance against me. If you want this to be over quickly, then don't move. I will be sure to grant you a merciful death."

 A single troll stands between us and freedom. However, it is a troll that is particularly bulky, and is wearing anti-magic armor from head to toe, while holding two scimitars in his hands. He grins triumphantly at us, and he decides to announce his presence by speaking as loudly as possible.

"Did you really think that you could get away that easily, after all you've done?" the troll says. "Unfortunately for you, the existence of this passage was never a secret to us.

He does not get to finish his sentence, as Leila makes a dash towards the troll, shocking him with her speed, and slashing his head right off with her dagger in an instant. Instead of dropping to the ground, however, the troll's body attacks her with the two scimitars, which Leila barely manages to avoid, by making a quick jump backwards.

 "That's not how you begin a battle, human," the troll's head says, from the ground. "Attacking an enemy out of the blue without giving them proper warning is a mark of cowardice. Did they not teach you proper gladiator etiquette when they brought you to the arena?"

His body then picks up his head from the ground, and it places it back on top of its neck. Within seconds, the head attaches itself back to its body, making it look as if there had never been a wound in the first place.

"I hope you've convinced yourselves of the futility of your actions," the troll says. "If you want this to end quickly, just stand there and don't move. I will be sure to grant you a merciful death."

 "That will not be necessary, Velgos," we hear a voice coming from behind the troll.

The man who spoke shows himself to us, and we see that he is rather plump, with short black hair and a goatee, wearing clothes that appear to be made entirely out of silk. The way he looks and dresses would normally make me peg him as a noble, if it weren't for the look in his eyes, which is similar to that of the goblin general's. That look makes him seem more like a war veteran that has seen many battles in his lifetime, than a pampered rich person who's lived his life in luxury.

"But, owner," Velgos, the troll says, "these are the intruders who came here to free the minotaur! We need to eliminate them quick, before they let him escape to the surface!"

"The minotaur is already gone," the man says. "I saw him teleport out of here with my own eyes. There is nothing else for you to do here. Return to your post."

"I refuse!" Velgos says, baring his teeth at his master. "They are responsible for the deaths of many of my comrades. I am not going to let them go."

 "I'm not telling you to let them go," the owner says. "I am only asking you to postpone your fight with them until the second round of the arena event. The minotaur is gone, and you are the only warrior we have who is on par with him, combat-wise. I will pay you handsomely if you join the fights in the arena, and you will also have your chance to avenge your fallen comrades, since these two will be participating in the fights. Wouldn't that be a better alternative for you than to lose your job needlessly because you lacked patience?"

The troll grumbles, but he does not seem like he wants to continue the argument.

"They'd better not get killed by the creatures in the first round," Velgos says, as he points towards us. "I want to kill them myself!"

"I wouldn't worry too much about that," the owner says. "I'd say that they have very good chances of making it to the second round alive, based on what I've seen so far. Now, get going. I need to lead our guests back to their cells."

"Fine," Velgos says. "We'll discuss my payment later."

With these final words, the troll walks away from us, and he disappears into the darkness of the caverns.

"You're going to lead us back to our cells?" I ask the owner. "Not that I'm complaining, but aren't you the arena's owner? Why would you let us go so easily?"

 "I'm not letting you go," the owner says, as he knocks on one of the walls, and a secret door opens in front of him. "I simply think that it would be a great waste if the stars of the show got killed before the spectacle even started. Besides, it is well within your rights to come and sabotage the arena before the main event. In fact, I hear that this used to be something of a tradition before the still winter, when the lessathi were still in charge of this arena. It was even encouraged by the organizers. The secret trapdoor that led you from your cells to here is a proof of that fact. Now, don't just stand there, follow me. This tunnel will lead us to where we need to go."

Leila and I exchange a look, and then we decide to follow the arena's owner into the newly revealed secret tunnel.

"You know," the owner says, as the door closes itself behind us, "I feel that I should thank you for the entertainment that you've provided me today."

"You do?" I say.

"Yes," the owner says. "It is not every day that you get to see Illuna of the sacred woods massacre, Arraka of the still winter and general Fyron of the free goblins wreak havoc through a monster filled dungeon. I realize that you weren't the ones who brought them here, but I would never have found out about them, if I hadn't followed the two of you since you fell into that lake."

"You've been following us from the very beginning?" I ask him, shocked.

 "Yes," the owner says. "There is an ancient alarm system that has been set up since the age of the lessathi, meant to warn me if anyone triggers the trap from the arena cells. I found you while you were drying up by the fire, and I have been following you from afar ever since."

"But how did you manage to remain undetected?" I ask him. "We even had Arraka with us, who could detect invisible enemies."

"Your goblin friend is not the only one who knows about secret tunnels," the owner says. "Over the years, I have built many such hidden corridors throughout these caverns, and I've had them covered with seredium dust, in order to make sure that I cannot be detected while I walk through them. I've also had an illusionist cast a spell on all the walls, which makes it so that you can see through them from inside the hidden tunnels, but not from the outside. This allowed me to watch the events unfold, without giving myself away."

"So," I say, "you've just been watching all this time, instead of stopping us? Why?"

 "I don't know if you've noticed or not," the owner says, "but beneath the lake that the two of you fell in, there is an old elevator, built by the lessathi hundreds of years ago. The elevator can only be activated with a spider shaped key that has been passed throughout my family for generations, but has never been used until now."

He pulls a spider shaped statuette made from stone out of his pocket, and he hands it to me.

"The mechanism that requires this key is located at the bottom of the lake," the owner says. "Simply insert the statuette into the spider shaped slot, and rotate it twice, in a clockwise direction. That should get the elevator going. Expect it to move a little slowly, though. It has not been used for centuries."

I nod to him, and I jump into the water, with the statuette in my right hand. I tell Leila to wait for me by the shore, so I can come back for her once I've activated the elevator. After diving into the water, I immediately find the spider shaped slot that the owner was talking about, and I do as he said, inserting the statuette into the hole and rotating it twice. 

 As I see the elevator start moving, I quickly swim back to the surface, and then all the way to Leila. She jumps into the water and grabs onto me, as I lead her right above the slowly elevating platform. Next, we wait in silence for a few minutes, while the platform gets out of the water and lifts us into the air, towards the ceiling. As we get close to the trapdoor that we initially fell through, the owner shouts his last words to us, from the lake's shore.

"Remember that I have very high expectations from you!" the owner says. "Make sure that you do not let me down."
