"So, Barry, let me get this straight," Daren says. "You're saying that trinket you're carrying with you is in fact a device that amplifies your physical attributes, which is powered by the magic all around us..."

"Right," I answer.

"And you're planning to use this device to fight the other mages that joined the tournament?"

"Correct."

Daren, Kate and I are sitting in a circle, on the rocky floor of a cave we found near the northern mountains. Our trip here has been rather uneventful, save for a few more dead bodies we've seen along the way. Daren has gotten out of his heavy armor since we arrived and is now wearing more comfortable clothes.

"Kate, I think this afternoon's events have been too much for the poor boy. He's gone completely delirious. You think you could knock some sense into our dear companion, here?

"No," Kate answers, curtly.

"Because you won't be bothered to--"

"Because he's right. The device he's carrying is indeed a stat booster, and most of those stats are meant to amplify his physical attributes."

"What?... Weren't you the one saying I shouldn't trust him just a few hours ago? Why are you defending him, now?"

"I'm not defending anyone. I've known the true function of these devices for a long time.  I don't need to trust him in order to know he's telling the truth."

"Fine, I give up. You win, Barry. So what are these stats of yours, anyway?"

"Correct."

"Barry, there is no such thing as talking to animals. I've heard you 'talk' to them, and it's nothing but weird animal noises. Just because you got lucky and they actually brought us to their lair doesn't prove you right. Kate, could you knock some sense into our dear companion, here?"

"No," Kate answers, curtly.

"Because you won't be bothered to--"

"Because he's right. The device he's carrying is indeed a stat booster, and one of those stats gives the owner knowledge of the ancient languages."

I show him my device's screen, where all of the nine stats are shown. Daren gives the device a long, pondering look, until he decides to speak.

"Alright. Here's my two copper pieces. I think that if we're to keep travelling in our current formation, and if that device of yours really does what you say it does, then what would help us all the most would be if you maxed that observation stat."

"Observation?... Why observation of all things?" I ask him.

"Because if you're good at observing details, you're far more likely to detect illusions. Usually, the best way to know you're in an illusion is to notice something minor that changed in the environment around you. No illusion is perfect. Sometimes there's a few leaves that disappear from the ground, some other times the sun is higher in the sky than it was before you entered the illusion. I'm really bad at noticing these kinds of things. Usually I only see it when it's too late. That hasn't killed me yet, but then again, I've never had to fight against the strongest mages in the world before. Even if you max all of your physical attributes, I doubt you'll ever be on par with me and Kate, let alone all the other mages that joined this tournament. But with good observation skills, you might well end up saving our lives when we enter our first illusion."

Daren pauses.

"Well, anyway, that's just my opinion. You can take it with a grain of salt. That little trinket is yours to use, so feel free to do whatever you want with it! However, I want you to decide now and tell us what you're going with, so that we can prepare our tactics accordingly. We can't afford to go into our next fight without a plan."

"I hope I'm not interrupting anything important," says Elaria as she approaches. "I thought you might be hungry after such a long journey."

She pushes a big plate of cooked meat towards us with her front hoof. Judging by the looks and smell, it appears to be... deer meat.

As the two of us talk, I can hear Daren whisper to Kate.

"I swear, I'm never going to get used to hearing him talk like that!"

Elaria pays him no mind and answers my question.

A grim thought occurs to me. I look at the deer meat in front of me and realize I haven't seen Molan in a while. No... She wouldn't... Would she?

"Molan?" I call out, jumping to my feet and looking all around me. "Molan!"

"Yeah?" Molan answers from one of the darker corners of the cave.

I slowly start to calm down as I hear the fawn's voice. Gods, what was I thinking? I'm really letting this afternoon's events get to my head. Elaria was surprised by my outburst, but it only took her a few seconds to understand what happened.

"By the great fox, you didn't think I would... Molan is my only son, I would never...

"I'm sorry. I'm letting this tournament get to me... I didn't mean to offend you."

"There's no need to apologize, outlander. Assuming the worst is only natural, given our current situation. Perhaps my choice of deer meat was uninspired, but I assure you I did not kill any of my kind to make this. Our protector, the great golden fox has taught me the art of  food conjuration.

"Who is this golden fox you speak of? Your leader?"

"You could say that. She is a very old spirit that has guided all animals on the continent for thousands of years. She is our protector, our shepherd and our teacher, and we all aspire to be like her."  

Oblivious to the meaning of our conversation, Daren decided to stop waiting for me, and started to eat. He offers Kate a morsel of deer meat.

"Barry is busy talking to his animal friends. He'll join us when he's done. Eat up, or your food will get cold."

"Shush, I'm trying to listen," Kate replies.

"You're kidding. You mean to tell me you actually understand what they're saying?

"Only a little. Which is why I need some silence in order to concentrate. So be quiet."

Kate's words seem to have caught Elaria's attention.

"There is no need to be embarrassed about your poor grasp of our language, woman outlander," the deer tells her in the ancient language. "I believe your name is Kate, is it not? Feel free to join our conversation if you want. I will try to use only words that are more commonly known in order to ease your understanding."

Kate was caught off guard by Elaria's proposal. She's struggling to form a coherent sentence in the deer's language.

"I... did not... know that you... spoke Common."

"I can understand it, but I am not allowed to speak it. The great fox has forbidden us to speak in the humans' language ever since the hunts of Olmnar began, a few decades ago.  Humans and animals on this continent had been living in harmony for hundreds of years, but it all changed when the people of Olmnar started hunting animals as a sport some forty years ago. That is when the great fox decided to sever all ties between the animal kingdom and the humans, and forbade us to speak the Common language ever again."

"So... not allowed.. speak .. us?" 

"Technically I shouldn't be talking to humans in general , but the only rule set in stone is that I'm not allowed to speak in the common language. I respect the great fox, and her decisions, but that does not mean I agree with all of them. I fear that the rift that has grown between our two races will only further amplify the conflict between us. Most humans have forgotten the art of food conjuration, and without us to help them, they have started turning to more primitive methods of acquiring food. What used to be only a sport practiced by Olmnar, has now become a means of survival for many humans. This war has already cost us so many lives,  including Molan's father, and I am getting more and more tired of it with each passing day..."

"But I digress. My friends, I thank you once more for your help. Our home is your home until you decide to take your leave. Please, eat to your heart's content, and do not hesitate to ask for more! I will be over there if you need me."

With these last words, Elaria bows her head, and goes to sit near her offspring, who is sleeping in a dark corner of the cave.

Daren, who has been eating all this time, is now looking at us, and shaking his head.

"Ok," he says. "I only have one question for you. Did you ask her if she's got more of these?"

He points at the plate of food in front of him.

"She said we can ask for a refill whenever we want," I answer him.

"Perfect! Then there's no need to hold back."

After the three of us are done feasting, Daren decides to pick up our initial conversation where we left off.

"Alright," he says. "Barry. I'm going to need you to decide now, and tell us how you're planning to use that stat booster of yours in the immediate future, so that we can prepare our tactics accordingly. We can't afford to go into our next fight without a plan."

After taking some time to consider my options, I give Daren my answer.

"I'm planning to focus primarily on avoiding attacks and drawing opponents' attention from now on."

"So I'm guessing that means you'll be maxing your speed and reflexes, then. And maybe premonition and combat technique for added versatility. Just make sure you don't put yourself at risk too much. Let me and Kate do the actual fighting. You just distract their attention."

Daren shifts his gaze towards Kate.

"Now, for the two of us. As you said after our last battle, I would rather not fight against weapon enchanters unless I have no choice. That's why I'm going to ask you to take care of them when the time comes."

Kate nods at Daren, as he continues to talk.

"As for myself, I am particularly good against elementalists, summoners and shapeshifters so I'll focus on them if we meet any."

He is speaking about mage specializations. Most mages will pick a certain type of magic and dedicate their life to perfecting it, instead of trying to learn as many spells as possible. 

Weapon enchanters use their magic to make their gear as strong as possible. Since they mostly rely on their weapons for combat, they will likely also train themselves in at least one martial art.

Elementalists are mages born with incredible talent at manipulating one of the four elements: water, air, fire or earth. However, they are born with the affinity for only one element, and they usually have problems mastering other spells, since they rely solely on their talent for casting their elemental spells, and generally have little knowledge of the arcane arts.

Summoners are mages who concentrate on summoning other creatures to fight for them. Since that leaves them vulnerable to surprise attacks, they will usually also focus on defensive spells, to keep them safe while their summoned creatures fight for them. 

Shapeshifters on the other hand go for a more personal approach, transforming themselves into other creatures instead of summoning them. This solves the vulnerability problem that summoners have, but it also limits their powers, as they are unable to cast other spells while transformed.

"What about you, Kate," Daren asks. "Do you have any weaknesses against any particular kinds of magic?"

"Yes," she answers.

"But you don't plan on sharing them with us."

"I do not."

 Daren shrugs.

"Suit yourself. Well, I think that's all we needed to discuss for now. Time for bed. Barry and I will take first watch. Come on, Barry!"

I follow Daren out of the cave, and together we start climbing the mountain, to reach a good vantage point. The moon is high in the sky, and the stars are bright. We won't have any trouble spotting enemies if they approach.

Daren sighs.

"I had a feeling you might say something like that. So I'm guessing that means you'll be maxing your strength, toughness and combat technique then. And maybe premonition, since it's probably good against surprise attacks. Just make sure you don't overestimate yourself. Let me and Kate handle our strong opponents. You just try and keep the weaklings out of our way."

If the enemy sees you just standing there they'll focus you first, like they did this time.

Does that mean that there's a dragon on this continent? And he knows the location of the Magium? I've heard about spells that brighten the stars in order to transmit information, but only in fairy tales. And the same goes for dragons. It must be a coincidence.

"I've been in a lot of places over the years, Barry. But everywhere I go, it's always the same. The weak are oppressed by the strong, the few are killed by the many. Everywhere I go, there's people dying from starvation, plague, war, or some monster invasion. I've seen death all my life, but I never get used to it. Seeing all of those dead bodies just lying there, lifeless, yesterday... It made me feel an intense pain in my chest. It was as though I could feel the suffering of each of them, and the fear that went through their hearts as they took their last breath. What about you, Barry? What did you feel when you saw all those dead people?"

I've tried all of my life to save the world from its misery, but no matter how hard I tried, my efforts were never enough. But with the help of the Magium...

His straightforwardness and his honesty took me by surprise.

"Of course I will," I tell him. "Since we both already know which one of us will be winning this tournament!"

"I'm not trying to seduce her, Daren."

"Of course you're not!" Daren says, in a sarcastic manner.

Slowly, Daren's smile fades away from his face and he adopts a more serious tone.

"Listen," he says. "I know your heart is in the right place. But you know as well as I do that women simply can't be born as mages. It's not in their blood. I don't know why she appears different from a normal banshee to you, and I don't know why the banshee inside her hasn't awakened yet, but it's only a matter of time. One day she will turn into a banshee, and I want you to be prepared when the time comes."

Daren takes a small device of his own out of his front pocket and hands it to me. It appears to be a magical transceiver. These devices are mostly used by soldiers, when they need to transmit information to each other over short distances, without having to shout to one another.

"I want you to carry this with you at all times. If you're ever in danger, just tap this three times, and I'll come over to help as fast as I can."

"Just promise me something," I tell him.

Daren sighs.

"You're asking a lot of me, Barry.  You should know better than anyone how hard it will be to stop her once she turns into a banshee. But if it means that much to you, then I'll promise."

He pauses.

Maybe she'll believe me if I tell her Daren was the one that decided not to purify her?

"Daren said he'd met a banshee before," I lie to her. "He said he could tell you were different somehow, and that he was going to keep an eye on you, for the time being."

"I see," Kate says with relief in her voice. "That's all I wanted to ask. Let's keep going, then."

"Wait, why ask me all of this? Why not ask Daren directly?

"Because Daren is the one that knows white magic, not you. He is the one who would normally want to purify a banshee. I didn't want to give him any ideas, in case the thought never occurred to him."

"And why would you believe that I'm telling the truth?"

"Because you're not a very good liar.  Your face gives you away."

Is that so?...

"There's something that's been bugging me ever since we met yesterday," she says. 

"When you and Daren first saw me, you started whispering between yourselves for about a minute. You said you were trying to decide whether I was a banshee or not, and Daren said  you had already established I wasn't one."

She pauses a bit, before she continues.

"The question is why? I decided to seek Daren's help because I fooled myself into thinking someone as kind hearted as him would not sentence me to death. But now that I have cleared my head and thought about it, I realize how much I've put myself at risk by showing myself to him.  Why did Daren decide I wasn't a banshee when all the evidence pointed to the contrary?"

"Well, in that case, I also have a question for you. You may not be a banshee but you can't be a mage either. Women can't be born as mages. So what are you?"

"Who says I was born a mage?"

My mind goes blank for a second, while I try to make sure I understood what she said correctly.

"Hold on, do you mean to tell me that you were born as a normal human, and that you later became a mage?"

"That is exactly what I'm saying."

"How?! Did you get access to the Magium? How did you do it? I must know!"

I realize too late that I had let the excitement get the better of me. Kate is looking at me with an expression that shows both bewilderment and a sudden understanding.

"By the gods," she says. "You were telling the truth, weren't you? You really are a human, and you came here in the hopes of becoming a mage. Listen to me, I have no idea what could motivate you enough to go on this suicidal quest, but the only things that you'll find at the end of your journey will be agony and despair. Quit now, and you might still make it out of this alive."

"You speak to me of agony and despair, but you chose to become a mage. Surely you must understand how I feel about this?"

"I do not. Because becoming a mage was never my intention. And I have no intention of continuing this conversation, either. I gave you a warning. You can choose to heed it or you can ignore it. This is all I'm willing to say on this subject."

Before giving me a chance to respond, she storms ahead as I rush to follow her. We travelled in complete silence for the next ten minutes.

As we get further and further away from the cave, I call out to her again.

"Wait," I tell her.

"What is it now?"

"We're getting too far away from our cave. What if anyone attacks Daren while he's asleep?"

"Oh, you don't need to worry about him."

"Why not?"

"See for yourself. Go on, try and head back to our cave."

Hesitantly, I start retracing my steps back towards the cave. Once I start walking, however, I get a powerful urge to go the other way.  I try again and I get the same result. No matter how many times I try, I simply can't keep going in the same direction. I keep turning in the opposite direction, sometimes, without even noticing. Is this some sort of spell? In all of my research, I've never read of such a thing.

"What did you do?" I ask Kate.

"I see. Apparently not even someone as learned as you would be familiar with this spell. It is understandable. They don't really use suggestion magic outside the continent of Varathia after all. The spell I used is part of a subset of magic called suggestion. What these spells do is that they insert an idea inside your head, and they make you think you were the one that came up with it. You may have noticed that something was wrong because you were specifically aiming to go in that direction, but most mages wandering around this area won't even notice the spell's effect."

"But how do I get around it?"

"In order to counteract the spell, all you need to do is focus on the cave, and visualize it clearly inside your head when you head towards it. As long as you have a set destination inside your head and not simply a general direction, the spell won't work on you. My knowledge of this spell was one of the only reasons I was able to survive against banshee hunters for so long. It covers a pretty large area, but unfortunately I can only cast it about two times a day, and it doesn't last for more than a few hours. Now let's go, our destination lies not much farther." 

After about five more minutes of walking, we finally come to a halt. The area we stopped in is full of fallen trees, similar to the one where we fought yesterday. Except this time there are no bodies. However, there's clearly been a big battle here. Perhaps even the battle that charged up my stat device before going to sleep. I can still feel the traces of leftover magic resonating strongly in the air around me.

"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

 "It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

Suddenly I see a vision of a dart being shot towards Kate. I realize immediately that what I've just seen was a premonition. But where did the dart come from? 

I turn back, and start looking carefully towards the trees far in the distance.

As I look towards the forest, I spot two shadowy figures hiding behind one of the trees.  One of them seems to be holding a crossbow, and it's aimed right at Kate.

"What happened?" asks Kate. "What are you looking for?"

The man behind the tree shoots his crossbow but I was waiting for it. 

"Look out!" I say, as I push Kate out of the dart's way.

"You blundering buffoon!" I can hear a man shout from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention. 

"How did you manage to miss that shot? Plan B! Go for plan B! Now!"

Suddenly, all of the trees around us get covered in a cloud of smoke. Between the lack of light, the distance, and the smoke screen, it is now almost impossible to tell where our enemies are hiding, except for the vague sense of their magic auras.

"Surrender, banshee!" says the man with the high pitched voice. "We have you surrounded. There's no way you can tell where we are through this thick smoke. If you surrender, we'll grant you and your human companion the gift of a quick and painless death!"

Yet another enemy who doesn't believe I'm a stillwater. I'm starting to doubt that this bluff was a good idea after all.

"Is this a joke?" says Kate. "I can sense that there's at least a hundred of you hiding behind the trees all around us. And yet none of you are mages. Do you seriously think you can win against mages by outnumbering them?"

"Mages are no gods. They bleed just like the rest of us. If they bleed, they can be killed. And so can you."

After he finishes his phrase, he blows a very loud horn which drowns out all other sounds in the woods, and suddenly a rain of crossbow bolts comes flying towards us from every direction. Kate quickly makes an ice dome around us to block their shots.

"Barry, can you see them through the smoke?"

I take a look through her semi-transparent ice dome, and try to see if I can distinguish any figures through the distant smoke screen. It appears that even with all of the unfavorable circumstances, I can still see our enemies clearly enough. This observation stat is truly amazing.

 "Yes, I can see them clear as crystal."

"Good, then you will be my eyes. When I dismiss this dome, I want you to give me all of their positions and I will take care of them while shielding you from any attacks."

Whoever shot that dart must be hiding behind the trees, but it's too dark to see them clearly. 

"What happened?" asks Kate. "What are you looking for?"

Before I get the chance to react,  a dart hits Kate in her left shoulder, and she drops to one knee.

"I'm alright..." Kate says, although she's clearly lying. She is breathing heavily and seems to be struggling to keep her consciousness.

I can hear a man laugh from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention. 

"As expected of a banshee," the man shouts. "Even an expensive sleep dart such as this is not enough to bring you down. But you are barely standing. The outcome of this battle is clear. Surrender now, and we'll show you mercy. We'll grant you and your human companion a quick and painless death."

Yet another enemy who doesn't believe I'm a stillwater. I'm starting to doubt that this bluff was a good idea after all.

As she speaks, one of Kate's eyes is twitching, and there is sweat dripping all over her face. 

"You can't be serious! You'll never survive for that long. You're barely even keeping yourself awake."

I hesitate, but I decide to go with Kate's plan. Trying to fight a hundred armed men by myself would be suicidal.

"Don't do anything stupid," I tell Kate as I head out of her ice dome. "Just try to stay alive until I get back."

As I reach the trees, Kate shouts after me.

"Wait! I forgot to tell you--"

The loud horn drowns out the sound of her voice, as she is forced to close back her dome to defend from all of the incoming crossbow bolts. I'm not sure if she realized I didn't hear all of that, but there's no more time to stand here and wait.

I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. 

Once I get closer, though, I start feeling a powerful urge to turn the other way. Of course. Kate's barrier. I had completely forgotten about it in my rush to get out of that battlefield. Was this what Kate was trying to warn me about?

I desperately try to keep going the right way, but without even realizing it, I always end up turning back. After running back and forth a few times, I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I realize I've been shot. One of the men that attacked us must have managed to catch up with me while I was wasting my time here, running around in circles. Before I even get the chance to turn around, I get shot two more times, and I fall to the ground, while my consciousness slowly fades away.

I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. 

As I reach Kate's barrier, I start focusing on the cave, specifically, and after doing that, just as Kate said, my mind clears and I am able to continue on my way. When I finally reach our camp, I wake up Daren by shaking him violently.

"Daren! Wake up! Kate's in trouble. You have to help. Quick!"

"What?... What time is it?"

"There's no time! You have to come with me. Please!"

Daren quickly puts on his armor and follows me out of the cave.

"Good gods, Barry, just how far did the two of you wander off?" asks Daren as we run towards Kate.

I give him no answer and I start running faster. When we reach our destination, we notice everything is completely silent, and there's a lot of dead bodies in our way. Once we get within eyeshot of Kate, we start to understand why there are no noises coming from the battlefield. Kate is sitting on her knees, with her head bowed down, and both of her hands holding the hilt of an ice sword thrust into the ground. Both Kate and her ice sword are full of blood, and the ground all around her is littered with dead bodies. As she hears us approach, she raises her head slightly to look at us and says:

"I'm sorry, where are my manners? I should have left at least a few survivors for the two of you."

As she finishes her sentence, she lets go of her sword and falls face first on the ground.

"Kate!!!" shouts Daren as he rushes to her side. He starts casting his healing spell, but he appears to be having difficulties. After a few minutes, he finishes his spell, but Kate still hasn't woken up, and some of her wounds have not closed.

"This kind of damage isn't going to just disappear with a simple healing spell," Daren says. "She'll need quite some time to fully recover. At least she's no longer in any mortal danger.

I agree to go with her plan, and she dismisses her dome.

"There's one over there, right beneath that branch," I tell her.  

She sends a cone of ice his way and hits him in the chest. 

"You got him! There's another one over there, right next to that tree."

"Which tree?"

"That one."

"Which side?"

"The left one."

"What's his height?"

"Height?..."

I measure him up with my eyes.

"About... five foot seven, I guess?"

She sends another cone of ice, which goes right through his head.

"He's dead. Alright, err, the next one is--"

"This is taking too long," Kate interrupts me, while conjuring floating ice shields left and right to defend us from the onslaught of crossbow bolts. "I have an idea."

She creates two huge fans made of ice, right above the smoke screen on our left side, and they start moving by themselves and blowing the smoke away.

"It's working," she says, as she conjures a few more to deal with the remainder of the smoke.

"NO!" shouts the man with the high pitched voice. "Don't let her blow away the smoke!"

It's too late, though. There are already hundreds of ice blades forming in the air, above Kate. She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. 

One last crossbowman who managed to survive the onslaught is now making a run towards us, in a desperate attempt to get behind Kate and to shoot her before she notices him. Kate remains unphased, and she shoots an ice cone straight into his head, sending his corpse tumbling to the ground, while his crossbow drops from his hands and lands a few feet behind me.

After I pick up the crossbow, I see that an enormous hand made of ice is now holding their leader by the back of his tunic and dragging him towards us, while he's frantically struggling to break free. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.

"Let me go! I order you! In the name of the duke of Bagelberry! Unhand me!"

The ice hand ignores him completely, and throws him at our feet. As he sees us, the man lets out a loud squeak, and jumps back. He trips over his own feet and lands on his rear.  

"Please... Please!" his tone of voice has completely changed, and he sounds like he's about to cry.

He throws himself at my feet.

"I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life. Please!"

He throws a bag of golden coins on the ground as he throws himself at my feet. This is quite a lot of money. I could easily live most of my remaining life in luxury with just this amount.

He scrambles to his feet and starts to run away.

Before he even takes his first step, however, a spike made of ice pops out of the ground, and impales him through his chest.

"Why?.. Why did--" he attempts to say, before his head drops to the side and his expression goes blank.

"Kate, what did you do?! I was trying to spare his life!"

"And you did. Congratulations! Thanks to you, his lifespan was extended by three whole seconds. You should be proud!"

"How could you do this? He was defenseless! He surrendered to us!"

"Yes, and I offered him a quick and painless death. Isn't that what he said he'd give us if we surrendered?"

"That doesn't mean we have to act like him!"

Kate sighs.

"Listen, Barry," she says. "I didn't kill this man for petty revenge. I killed him because once he would've calmed down, he'd have started procuring himself a new army, and he would have likely made it his mission to hunt us down, so that he could take HIS petty revenge on us.

"Maybe it's that banshee. Maybe she used her magic to get him."

"Don't be ridiculous, the banshee is barely even able to hold her ground."

While the men are arguing amongst themselves, I'm trying to find the right moment to distance myself from them. As I stand there and listen, with my back pressed against the tree, an arm appears from behind me, holding a knife in its hand. It quickly slices my neck, and blood starts pouring out.

I fire two more shots, still aiming for their legs and both men drop to the ground with a loud thump.

The last man standing fires a bolt towards me, but I dodge it in the nick of time, and aim for him next.

I notice too late that one of the men lying on the ground managed to grab back his crossbow and is aiming it straight at me. 

There was no time for me to react.  His crossbow bolt hit me right in the face, and I died almost instantly.

I quickly grab the crossbow from the ground, and jump right in front of the five men, aiming for the one in the middle. I shoot him directly in the head, and before he even drops to the ground, I shoot one of his comrades as well, this time in his neck. As the two of them fall to the ground, lifeless, I hide behind a tree, while three crossbow bolts fly right past me.

Three shots. I've only got three shots left. 

I jump out from behind the tree, and try to aim for the ones that are still alive, but there's no one in sight. I realize they must have hidden themselves as well. As I try to figure out where they're hiding, one of them quickly pops out from behind a tree and shoots for my chest.

Luckily, I saw him before he took the shot, so I had the time to get out of his bolt's way. 

I shoot my attacker right through the heart, before he gets the chance to hide back behind his tree. I then spot one of the two other men, right before he jumps out. This time, my crossbow bolt hits him in the stomach, but the shot took him out, regardless.

The last man standing is visible, behind one of the trees. I'm not willing to wait for him to attack me first, so I take the shot.

My aim doesn't fail me, and the crossbow bolt pierces his temple, splattering the tree with his blood.

That was the last of them.

I take a glance towards the clearing, to see how Kate is doing. It seems she's given up on trying to aim through the smoke, and instead conjured some enormous fans made of ice that are currently in the process of blowing away all the smoke. 

As the smoke clears away, I can see hundreds of ice blades forming in the air, above Kate. She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. 

It appears she didn't really need my help after all. Since there's nothing left for me to do here, I go back to where Kate is standing.

"You're insane. What are you planning to do? Talk them all to death?"

"Either you give me that dagger, or I'm going in barehanded. The choice is yours."

Once Kate understands I'm not going to change my mind, she reluctantly forges an ice dagger and hands it to me. When I grab it, I realize the hilt is also made out of ice, but its shape makes it easy enough for me to hold on to, and this is not the time and place to whine about how cold it feels in my hand.

"Perfect," I say. "Now open up the dome. And make sure you keep it closed until I'm done. Just stay on the defensive for as long as you can. Don't take any stupid risks."

"Are you sure about this?"

"As sure as I can be, given the circumstances. Do it."

She creates an exit just wide enough for me to fit through, as I step out and make a run for the forest.

When I reach the woods, I notice a man behind a tree, reloading his crossbow. His back is turned to me, and he didn't hear me coming yet.

This means that I could try to take them all out by very quickly moving from one to the other, while they're distracted.

This is not an easy task. Not by a long shot. When I first rushed towards them, I almost got shot by three crossbow bolts. They already greatly outnumber me. Closing in on them with a melee weapon when they've all got crossbows seems almost suicidal.

But speed is all I've got. I'm not confident enough to shoot my crossbow while moving, and if I stop for even a second, I'll get a crossbow bolt through my skull. I have to make it work. First of all, I need to single them out. I can't fight them all at once.

I use my superior agility to quickly distance myself from them, and make sure that they've completely lost my trace. I then start shooting my crossbow at several trees that are far apart from each other, in order to distract my attackers. A few of them take the bait, and get closer, to investigate the source of the sound.

These are not trained soldiers. At best, they could be some lowly personal guards. There's no way an organized group would ever break their formation because of a cheap trick like this.

This strategy isn't working out as well as I had planned, either. I'm missing most of my shots and  wasting my ammo, while my enemies are getting closer. 

Unfortunately I don't really have the time to switch my tactics anymore. It's all or nothing. I try to back away some more, but one of the men was waiting right behind me.

I look around me, and find a fallen tree that looks just about the right size for my intents and purposes. They won't be expecting this.

I lift the tree off the ground and throw it straight at my attackers. The tree hits five of them head on, and they get completely crushed under its weight. The rest of them are either screaming or simply stunned with shock.

"M-M-Monster! DIE!!!" screams one of them, as he shoots his crossbow at me.

I lift another fallen tree off the ground, and use it as a shield to defend me from his crossbow bolt. I then wield it as a club, and use it to smash his head into the nearest rooted tree. As I lift my oversized club to gaze upon my attacker, I notice that nothing remains of the man's head, except for the red paste splattered on the trees.
 
The other four men start screaming their lungs out. One of them is in such a hurry to leave that he trips and falls, another one literally pissed his pants, and the other two are running away as fast as their legs can carry them, and as far away from the battlefield as possible.

First, I take care of the runners. Luckily for me, they are both running in a straight line, so I simply throw my tree towards them. They are too panicked to even think about looking behind them, so  they don't get a chance to get out of my projectile's way. The tree lands on both of them, and crushes them in an instant. 

Since I am running out of fallen trees that are light enough for me to lift, I lift a big boulder off the ground, and throw it at the man who tripped and fell while attempting to flee, and who is now making a second run for it. My swing had so much power behind it, that when the rock hit the crossbowman, it literally lifted him off the ground, and smashed him against a nearby tree's trunk.

The last man alive, the one who wet his pants, is now on his knees and bowing his head.

"P-P-Please! Mercy!" He says to me.

"No." I reply curtly, as I pick a branch off the ground, and smash his head in.

I cut a branch that looks solid enough to use as a blunt weapon from the tree behind me, and I wait for the crossbowmen to separate.

I start by targeting the splinter group with the fewer members.

In a split second, I reach behind them, and knock the first man out with a well placed hit of my improvised club. Before the second one even has the time to figure out what's going on, I knock him out as well, and then I hide behind the next tree. Fortunately, the other crossbowmen are too focused at what they're doing and haven't noticed that their allies have been taken out. 

This is perfect. It means I still have time to take out another group before they realize what's going on. I see my next targets, cautiously advancing towards one of the trees I shot earlier. There's three of them this time. I'd better be careful.

Just like before, I wait for a moment when they're all with their backs at me, I arrive behind them almost instantly, and before they have the chance to realize what's going on, two of them are already on the floor, unconscious. The third one, however, managed to parry my hit, and is now trying to aim his crossbow at my stomach. 

I slash his hand with my ice dagger , and he is forced to drop his weapon. I attempt to knock him out again with my club, but he simply blocks my hit again, and reaches for his own knife. 

I've already decided that I'm not going to kill anyone in this fight, and I'm not going to back out of it now. No matter what happens, I am not ending this man's life. The man lunges at me with his knife, but I dodge his hit, and try to knock him out again. This time, he grabs a hold of my arm,  and he twists it until it breaks. The pain of it breaks my concentration, and I am unable to dodge the next strike of his knife, which hits me right in the stomach. As I struggle to stay on my feet, the man casually picks up his crossbow from the ground and points it at my face. His expression shows nothing but contempt.

"You overestimated yourself, boy," he says, as he pulls the trigger.

His face is the last thing I see, before my consciousness fades completely.

I then take them out methodically, by taking advantage of my steady aim and my superior tactics.

As I take out more and more of them, the crossbowmen are starting to gradually lose their will to fight, and are starting to flee the battlefield in greater numbers. They have no discipline.

That was a bit too risky. I need to draw less attention to myself if I want to survive this fight. 

I start moving more cautiously, making sure I don't get detected until I get a clear view of all my enemies. When I encounter a larger group, I try to distract some of the men, and divide their attention. 

I then take them out methodically, from a great distance, taking advantage of the fact that they can't see where the shots are coming from until it's too late.

I can't afford to keep running into enemies like this. My priority is their leader. I start moving more cautiously, making sure I get a clear view of my enemies before getting detected. I manage to avoid any resistance until I reach their leader's location. He's only got a handful of guards surrounding him. He was definitely not expecting an ambush. 

I take my time to silently neutralize all of the enemy's forces that are within hearing range of their leader, and then I quickly take out his personal guards, before they get the time to react. Their leader just realized what happened and is now screaming like a little girl. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.

"W-W-What are you doing here?" he asks. "How did you get here? Guards? Guards!"

"Nobody's coming to help you. All of the crossbowmen in hearing range of you have been taken care of. It's just you and me."

"N-N-No! Don't come closer. Stay back!"

I grab him by the tunic, to make sure I have his undivided attention.

"Listen to me. I don't care what country you're from, or how you got so many men to follow you here, but you are my hostage now. If you don't tell all of your troops to step out of the forest, drop their weapons and surrender, I am going to murderer you right here and now, and then I'll do the same to all of your guards."

"No, wait! I can't!"

"Of course you can. That horn you're holding in your hand also doubles as a magical voice magnifier, does it not? Now hurry up. I think my trigger finger may be slipping."

He reluctantly puts the voice magnifier to his mouth, and calls out to his troops.

"Attention, all men! This is the duke of Bagelberry speaking. I have just been captured by the enemy. I repeat, I have just been captured by the enemy. You are all to step out of the forest, throw down your weapons and surrender!"

The forest falls silent, as the crossbowmen's relentless attacks towards Kate suddenly come to a halt. They are confused, that much I can tell.

"Didn't you hear me?! As your ruler, I COMMAND you to come out of that forest and drop your weapons! Now!"

After a small delay, the first couple of crossbowmen start stepping out of the shadows, followed by a wave of a few dozen more men. Eventually they all step out of the forest, and throw their weapons at Kate's feet, declaring their surrender.

"There, I did what you asked!" says the duke. "Now will you let me go?"

"And why would I do that? The way I remember it, all you offered us if we surrendered was a quick and painless death."

 "No!" he yells in his girly voice as he's starting to cry. "Please! I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life. Please!"

"I offered them a quick and painless death. Isn't that what they said they'd give us if we surrendered?"

"But did you have to kill every single one of them?"

"Yes, I did."

She sighes.

"Listen, Barry. I know you might not be used to this, but you have to understand. We're not in a situation where we could realistically hold such a large number of prisoners. And it's not like they've done anything illegal, so we couldn't turn them over to the local authorities, either. If we had tied them up and left them here, then they'd just have died of hunger or been killed by someone else. If we'd simply let them go, then they were sure to come after us for revenge at a later date. There was no other way."

"I... suppose you're right." I tell her, hesitantly. "I guess we're done here, then. Let's go back to our cave."

"I'll be honest," says Kate, as we make our way back to camp. "I didn't really expect you to pull it off."

"Yeah. Neither did I."

"That's twice I owe you now, Barry. Did you ever consider opening up a bank?"

"I'll give that a thought, after the end of the tournament."

We spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore. After all we've been through this morning, a bit of quiet is more than welcome.
