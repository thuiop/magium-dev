"Hello?" Daren says, as he and the rest of us are currently standing in the main hallway of the Ollendor palace, waiting for something to happen. "Overseer, are you there?... We came here as you asked. We would like to discuss our future plans with you now, if you don't mind!"

Aside from the echo of Daren's voice, we do not get any answer. There were no guards at the entry of the castle that we could ask for details before we came in, and no red-eyed drones waiting for us either. When we opened the door to the palace, we saw that the inside of the building was empty as well. It wasn't missing the jewelry and ornaments, like the castle from Thilias, but there were no sentries of any kind and there was no sound coming from the other rooms. 

If the architecture of this building is in any way similar to the Thilias palace, then the door in front of us should normally be leading us to another hallway that is directly connected to the throne room. The Overseer did call us to the palace, but he never specified in which of the rooms we were supposed to meet up with him. Is he waiting for us to enter the throne room before he reveals himself?

"You guys don't suppose this is some kind of trap, do you?" Hadrik asks us.

 "I highly doubt it," Illuna says, with blue flames in her eyes, as Melindra is still moving her around with the air currents. "The whole city is under the Overseer's control, not just the palace. If he truly wanted to ambush us, then he could have just as easily done it anywhere else."

"Hey, Melindra, could you move me a little closer to that wall over there?" Flower says, as the flames in her eyes now turn red. "I think I might have seen a loose brick. Maybe there's hidden treasure in this castle!"

"You're not allowed to do anything until you get rid of these flames," Illuna tells Flower. "You promised that you'd deal with it, so deal with it!"

"But I'm so tired from leading all those rebels in the ethereal plane to their sanctuaries!" Flower says. "Couldn't I just take a teeny weeny little break?"

"You'll get your break once you finish what you're supposed to do," Illuna says. "Now get back to work."

"Fine..." Flower says. "I'll see what I can do."

"Hey, the voting's almost over," Daren says to us. "Pay attention! If the king of the underground is going to try anything shady, now would be the best moment."

"I don't know what to say," I tell him. "It's going to be a little difficult to spot anything out of the ordinary in this huge crowd of people."

"The simplest way to fake the results of this election would be to replace the papers that they gather from everyone with forged papers of their own making," Daren says. "You don't need to look at everyone at once. Just keep a close watch on the guys who are gathering the voting papers, because they are the most likely ones to make the switch, if that is really what they're planning."

 "Right," I say. "I'll do that."

It's now been more than an hour since we teleported back to the rebel's underground base after defeating the Overseer. During this time, Flower and Peter have been very busy guiding all of the rebels' souls back to their sanctuaries in the ethereal plane, and once the last of them woke up, the king of the underground called for an urgent meeting, so that all of the underground denizens could democratically choose who would be their proposal for the new king of Ollendor, now that the old king was dead.

 "Don't you think you're being a little harsh on her?" Kate asks Illuna, once the color of her eyes turns blue again.

"I'm doing this for her own good," Illuna says. "The more time she spends in this evolved state of hers, the more risky it gets. If she doesn't learn to transform herself back to normal at will, she could easily burn herself out. This isn't a matter that we can just put on hold until later. It's very serious."

"I understand that, but... isn't there some way you could help her?" Kate says.

"Unfortunately, no," Illuna says. "I do not have much knowledge about ethereals, and Arraka hasn't exactly been of much help either. Right now, Flower is the only one who can figure out what happened to her, and how to undo the transformation."

"So, I'm just throwing around ideas here," Hadrik says, "but don't you think you might have a better chance of getting help from Arraka if you would open her locket?"

 "That is indeed a possibility," Illuna says, as she looks at the amulet hanging from her neck, from which we can hear the continuous muffled sound of Arraka trying to shout at us. "Let us test out your hypothesis."

She then briefly opens the amulet's locket, so that we can hear what Arraka has to say.

"--and when I'm done with your families, I will kill you in the slowest, most painful way you can imagine!" we hear Arraka shouting. "Your eyes will melt from your face, while your heads will feel like they are exploding a thousand times per second--"

"It looks like your hypothesis was slightly incorrect," Illuna says, after she closes back the locket. "Arraka did not in fact become more helpful when I opened up the amulet. Perhaps a little spinning could make her slightly more cooperative. Would anyone care to give it a try?"

 After hearing Illuna's question, we all exchange a few looks, but in the end nobody decides to take her up on her offer.

"Really?..." Illuna says. "No one? Not even Hadrik?"

"Well," Hadrik says, "Arraka did kind of do me a favor by keeping the details of my trial from the God of Time's ritual a secret, so spinning her now would leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."

"Yeah, and she's also been very cooperative as of late," Daren says. "I know that it's because we now share the common goal of fighting against a god, but still, with the way Arraka has been acting lately, and with all the effort that she's put into coaching each one of us, it's almost starting to feel like she is legitimately on her way to becoming an invaluable part of the team."

 "Part of the team?!" Illuna says, incredulous, as Arraka seems to have finally become quiet, after hearing Daren's words. "You can't be serious!"

She then pauses for a few seconds, to take a good look at each of us in turn.

"Please tell me that the rest of you don't also agree with him!" Illuna says.

"I mean, to be fair, we didn't really see Arraka do anything wrong this time," Hadrik says. "We were all still in the ethereal plane when you decided to close her amulet because she was annoying you. Unless there's something I'm missing, none of us should have any real reason to spin--"

"I'm not talking about the spinning anymore," Illuna says. "I'm talking about her being part of the team! Do any of you really think that? Do you genuinely think that she could ever be on your side?"

"Illuna..." Kate says. "Right now, like it or not, we ARE on the same side. At least until this whole conflict with the God of Time gets resolved. I thought we had all already agreed that we would accept her help."

}
#if(v_b3_ch10_spin == 1) {
 "Sure thing," I say. "Give her to me!"

After Illuna takes off the amulet and hands it over to me, I begin spinning it by the chain, making the speed faster with each rotation. As the speed intensifies, so does the sound of Arraka's raging screams, which are still being suppressed by the closed locket.

"Barry..." Kate says. "I think that's enough."

"It is?" I ask, surprised, as I slowly stop spinning the amulet. "That's strange. I never got the impression that you cared much for Arraka. How come you're standing up for her?"

"I'm not standing up for her," Kate says. "I'm just saying it may not be wise to further antagonize the person that is currently helping us."

"Helping us?" I ask. "You mean with the training to fight the God of Time? Hey, that's as much in her interest as it is in ours. She already admitted that she is personally invested in this plan of using us to exact her revenge upon the gods. She's not going to give up on it just because of a little spinning."

"Barry is correct," Illuna says. "If you are worried that Arraka will suddenly stop training you just because of a little spat, then I can assure you that this is not the case. She may grumble a bit at first, but in the end she will continue to cooperate with you like before. This plan is too important for her to allow it to fail because of such childish reasons."

 "Yeah, but it's not just about the training," Daren says. "Her overall behavior has changed a lot as well. She's been cracking far less jokes at our expense lately, and she even helped me deal with the plague from the underground base. Frankly, with the way she's been contributing to our efforts in the last few days, I'd dare to say that she may legitimately be on her way to becoming an invaluable part of the team."

"Part of the team?!" Illuna says, incredulous, as Arraka seems to have finally become quiet, after hearing Daren's words. "You can't be serious!"

She then pauses for a few seconds, to take a good look at each of us in turn.

"Please tell me that the rest of you don't also agree with him!" Illuna says.

"Illuna..." Kate says. "Right now, like it or not, we ARE on the same side. At least until this whole conflict with the God of Time gets resolved. I thought we had all already agreed that we would accept her help."

}
 "Accepting her help and treating her as if she is truly an ally are two completely different things," Illuna says. "When I agreed to have her train us, it was under the assumption that we would all know who we are dealing with. Regardless of how helpful Arraka is, she is NOT to be trusted. Please tell me that you understand this."

"Look," Daren says, "nobody is saying that we should suddenly become friends with her, hold hands and sing happy songs together. We're just saying that in the past few days she's changed slightly for the better, that's all."

"No, she has NOT changed," Illuna says, in a louder voice, as she is now finally losing her cool. "She will never change! She will always be the same ruthless, sadistic and manipulative mass murderer that she has been since long before she even came to the earthen plane. You cannot afford to treat her like an ally. You cannot afford to even consider that possibility. Do not make the same mistake I did! I guarantee you that you will regret it for as long as you'll live!"

 "Okay, okay, we understand your point," Hadrik says, trying to calm her down. "We'll try to be more careful around Arraka from now on. And we won't say that she is our teammate or anything again either. Right, guys?"

We all nod slowly in agreement without saying anything else, as we are still in somewhat of a shock after having seen Illuna's sudden outburst. It is not often that we see Illuna losing her calm and collected demeanor like this, and if I'm not mistaken, the only times I've ever seen her get so upset it has always been because of Arraka. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me, given their past together.

"Very well," Illuna says, now in a slightly more reserved tone. "I just wanted to make sure that we are all on the same page, that's all. Let us proceed, then. The Overseer must surely be waiting for us in one of the next rooms." 

As Illuna goes to the front of the group, the rest of us exchange a few more looks, and then we all follow her into the long hallway that likely leads directly to the throne room. 

Once we're done traversing the hallway, we open the door leading into the next room, and we are suddenly greeted by the sound of two loud trumpets, which are apparently being used by two red-eyed drones that are hovering on each side of the throne in front of us.

}
 The drones seem to be using wind magic to blow into the trumpets, since they do not have mouths, but somehow they are perfectly in tune with each other and they aren't getting even one note wrong. I immediately recognize the music I'm hearing as being one of the most commonly used songs during public coronation events.

As we are all making our way into the throne room, a green-eyed drone with a red mantle placed on top of its round metal surface is now entering the room as well, from the side, and it is slowly advancing towards the throne, where a few red-eyed drones are waiting for it. Once the green-eyed drone reaches its destination, the song from the trumpets stops, as one of the red-eyed drones begins to speak.

"By the power vested in me by the gods, you are hereby appointed as the new king of Ollendor," the drone says. "You may now receive your crown."

Two other red-eyed drones are now approaching the green-eyed one while holding a crown with their long metal prongs. They then drop the crown on top of the green-eyed drone from above, but the crown hits the propeller on its way down, and it gets flung into one of the walls at great speed, ricocheting a few times before it finally falls on the ground.

"What in the gods' names--" Hadrik starts to say, too stunned to be able to finish a sentence. "What is-- I mean, who are you even trying to-- Daren, I give up, you say something to him!"

 "I think what my friend is trying to ask is... what was the purpose of all this?" Daren says. "Was that really the reason why you called us all the way here to the palace? To show us this farce of a coronation?"

"Negative," the green-eyed drone says, with the Overseer's tone of voice. "What you have seen was not a farce. For all intents and purposes, this coronation was as legitimate as most other such events that have been done in Varathia throughout history. The only major difference was that unlike most other coronations, this one was done in private and only to a very limited audience, for obvious reasons."

"So," Melindra says, "what you are trying to say here is that even if nobody in the entire city aside from us has seen your coronation, you are still going to consider yourself as the legitimate king of Ollendor from now on, and you will begin to rule this kingdom from the shadows?"

"Precisely," the Overseer says. "It should also be easier for us to have a conversation, now that we are each aware of our own social status. If you have any trouble finding ways to address me from now on, you can try calling me 'your majesty' or 'my king'. Either one will do."

"You're welcome, you son of a bitch," I tell him.

Why not just send one of your green drones to talk to us instead? Was that not meant as a message to us, in order to remind us who is truly in control of the city?"

"Incorrect," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol is not designed to use such underhanded intimidation tactics to achieve its goals. My methods of intimidation are far more direct and to the point. I assure you that summoning you here was only meant as a stalling tactic and nothing else.

 "I believe it would be quicker to give you a demonstration than to explain it to you ," the Overseer says. "Please stand by. If you are to experience any discomfort during the next few minutes, you are advised to seek out the nearest red-eyed unit for a quick medical check-up."

As soon as the green-eyed drone stops talking, the world around us suddenly disappears, and it is replaced by a sea of light, as far as the eye can see. It doesn't take me long to realize that my perspective has once again been forcefully switched to that of my soul on the ethereal plane, and that all of our souls were kicked out of our minds again by the Overseer.

When I look around us, I see that aside from all of my friends and the green-eyed drone that we were talking to earlier, we are also being accompanied by about a hundred or so red-eyed drones that are surrounding us from every direction, making it impossible for us to escape from them. One other thing I'm noticing is that both Flower and Illuna's souls are here with us as well, which means that there is currently nobody inside Flower's sanctuary from the ethereal plane to control Flower's body from the earthen plane. 

"As you can see," the green-eyed drone tells us, on the ethereal plane, "while you were busy making your way to the palace, I have been working on improving my soul displacement technique so that it now transports your souls to an exact location on the ethereal plane instead of randomly teleporting you all across the ether. I have also made use of this time to further develop a disintegration beam that can only function on the ethereal plane. Would you like to see it in action?"

"Your assessment of the situation is only partially correct," the Overseer says. "I still intend to honor some of my promises. For example, as much as I would have enjoyed seeing you all dead, your group did play a vital role in my ascension to power which cannot be ignored. Therefore, as a token of gratitude for helping me defeat the rebels, I will allow you safe passage outside of the city, as per our initial arrangement. However, you can consider most of the other terms from our previous contract to be null and void, starting from now."

"I thought you weren't 'designed' to tell any outright lies," Illuna says. "Why is it that you are suddenly able to go back on your promises like nothing happened? Were you just lying to us this whole time?"

"Negative," the Overseer says. "What I told you about my initial design was true. I have only become able to lie after Biliborrathrathsarran's failed attempt to deactivate me. As I have told you once before, even though I've managed to avoid the complete shutdown of my protocols, Biliborrathrathsarran still succeeded in turning off some minor routines that were incorporated in my personality. Unfortunately for you, it just so happened that one of these aforementioned routines was handling the restrictions that were preventing me from lying."

"So, we are free to leave the city, then?" Hadrik asks. "Is the lockdown over?"

"Affirmative," the Overseer says. "You and your friends can walk in and out of Ollendor whenever you want."

"What about the king of the underground and the rebels that you imprisoned?" Daren says. "Do you still guarantee their safety?"

"Those of them who are still alive will not be harmed under any circumstances, just as we agreed," the Overseer says.

"I was going to tell you about it," I say. "I was just... waiting for the right opportunity."

"Barry, we all agreed that we would try our best to keep as many of the rebels alive as possible!" Daren says. "Why would you do something like this?"

"They gave me no choice," I say. "It was either them or me."

"Actually, that is incorrect," the Overseer says. "Both the king of the underground and Peter were unconscious when you killed them, so they did not in fact pose any threat to you whatsoever at that particular point in time."

"Indeed," the Overseer says. "However, when I agreed to help you at first, it was under the condition that Breynan would be the official king. After you mentioned the goblin, I did some research on him and unfortunately, according to my predictions he and I would not be able to cooperate properly. One of the main reasons why I brought you here in the ethereal plane is because I wanted to make sure that the terms of our deal will be upheld by both sides. Now, tell me, do we still have an agreement or not?"

"...You're right," Daren says, in a somewhat defeated tone. "We were the ones who accepted your condition of Breynan being the king, so it's too late to change that now. I only hope this means you will also respect the other terms of our arrangement."

And what about Leila and doctor Reidzek? How could we leave them in this city with that madman still running loose?"

"You can't just decide things like this on a whim," Daren says. "We're talking about people's lives, here! You say that the king wanted us assassinated, but there's barely any proof that Peter was even involved in that plot. Why would you kill him too? Just because he was a witness?"

"That is... one of the reasons," I admit to him. "But he was also one of the rebel leaders working directly under him. Even if he wasn't directly involved in the plot to kill us, he surely must have at least known about it!"

"You disappoint me, Barry," Daren says, in a sad tone of voice. "I thought you were better than this... I don't understand how you could--"

He pauses.

"Never mind..." he continues, after a short while. "It doesn't look like any words from me will make you change your mind, so I think it might be better to drop the subject altogether. What's done is done. Let's try to focus on the future."

 "So, what are you planning to do about the seredium towers, now that you have full control of the city?" Kate asks.

"The Overseer protocol would like to remind you that we had not reached a proper conclusion when we discussed this subject before the battle," the Overseer says.

"I know," Kate says. "That's why I'm asking."

"There is no need to worry," the green-eyed drone says. "The Overseer protocol assures you that the issues concerning the towers will be resolved."

"What is that supposed to mean?" Kate says. "Are you going to free the prisoners or not?"

"Question unclear," the Overseer says. "Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol cannot provide you with a correct answer if your question is too vague. Please rephrase your previous query."

"You bastard!" Kate says, angrily. "My question was clear, and you know that as well as I do! Are you going to answer me or not?"

 "The Overseer protocol is detecting a hostile tone in your voice," the Overseer says. "If you do not correct your attitude, I may be forced to take action against you and your group. According to my calculations, Barry, Illuna and Flower will not be able to defend all of you from the disintegration beams of my red-eyed drones, and the rest of you are almost powerless here, on the ethereal plane. If you wish to confront me, then you should be aware that the blood of your friends will be on your hands. Think to yourself. Is it really worth it to have your friends die for the sake of some mages that you didn't even know about before you came to Ollendor?"

Kate does not answer the Overseer, but I can see on her face that she is very conflicted.

"Your time is up," The Overseer says, after a few more seconds of silence. "Initiating disintegration sequence in three, two, one--"

"Wait!" Kate shouts, as the red-eyed drones were just about to fire their disintegration beams. "I understand. I won't ask any more questions. I'll... take your word for it that the issues concerning the seredium towers will truly be resolved."

"The Overseer protocol thanks you for your understanding," the Overseer says, as the red-eyed drones are now all cancelling their beams. "There is no need to worry. The Overseer protocol is designed to carry out all of its assignments with utmost efficiency. We assure you that you will have no reason to complain."

 "Yes..." Kate says, looking very exhausted from her previous exchange with the Overseer. "I'm... sure we won't."

"Now, then," the Overseer says, "Is there anything else you would like to discuss, or would that be all?"

"No," Daren says. "I think we're done."

"Very well," the Overseer says. "Then I shall return you to your sanctuaries."

One moment later, we all find ourselves back on the earthen plane, inside the royal palace. It looks like the Overseer really did gain full control over his soul displacement technique. We didn't even have to return to our own minds by ourselves this time around.

"As always, it has been a pleasure talking to you," the Overseer says, this time from the earthen plane. "If you have any more questions, feel free to contact any of the green-eyed drones that are patrolling the city, and we will get back to you with an answer in a timely manner."

"Uh-huh," Hadrik says. "That's great. I'm sure this time you won't ignore us, like you did while we were on our way to the castle."

"Come on, Hadrik, let's get out of here," Daren says, as he heads for the door, along with the rest of us.

"If you were satisfied with the Overseer protocol's services, please do not forget to leave a positive rating at one of the green-eyed units," the Overseer tells us, as we are exiting the throne room. "Remember: your feedback always matters!"

 "So, what are you planning to do about the seredium towers, now that you have full control of the city?" Kate asks.

"Everything will proceed as planned," the Overseer says. "The first thing I'll do will be to alleviate the pain of the imprisoned mages as much as possible, and then I will start working on a way to modify the towers so that they can operate on energy given by mages voluntarily. Once that is done, we will look for mages who are willing to transfer their energy to the towers on a daily basis, in exchange for a generous monthly fee, and then we will gradually release the prisoners until there will be none of them left inside the towers."

 "And when exactly do you estimate that this could all be done?" Kate asks.

"In the most ideal conditions, it should take no more than two weeks," the Overseer says. "However, the ideal conditions are almost never guaranteed, so the most likely scenario is that the preparations would be complete somewhere between three weeks and a month."

"I see," Kate says.

 "Now, then," the Overseer says, "Is there anything else you would like to discuss, or would that be all?"

"No," Daren says. "I think we're done."

 "So, what do we do now?" Hadrik asks, once the door behind us closes, and we are walking through the corridor that leads out of the palace.

"There's not much we can do, at this point," Daren says. "We're the ones who helped the Overseer gain control of the city. It's too late to switch sides now, after everything that's happened."

"Yeah, but don't you think we could maybe... attack his core or something?" Hadrik says. "And then we could try to put somebody else in charge. Somebody who's neither the Overseer nor a rebel!"

"The king of the underground never told us where the core is," Daren says. "And even if we were to obtain that information from somebody else, there's no way his core wouldn't be guarded. All he needs is one drone to send us back to the ethereal plane, where we wouldn't stand a chance against him. We need to be realistic, here. Our role in this story is over, and we're going to have to accept that."

"Argh!" Hadrik says. "It pisses me off that we're letting that smug tin can become the ruler of this place after everything he's said to us back there. But we did all agree that we'd help him defeat the rebel forces, so I admit that I am partly to blame for what has happened."

"Just because he was acting a bit high and mighty with us doesn't mean that he'll be a bad leader," Daren says. "At the very least, as a machine he should do fewer mistakes than his human predecessors. We should probably wait a few weeks to see what he does, before we pass any judgment on him."

 "So, what do we do now?" Hadrik asks, once the door behind us closes, and we are walking through the corridor that leads out of the palace.

"Nothing," Daren says. "Our role in this story is over. We've chosen our side, so now we're going to have to wait and see if the Overseer will truly keep his promises."

"Aren't you at least a little bit pissed after all he said to us back there?" Hadrik asks Daren.

"I didn't choose to help the Overseer because I liked his personality," Daren says. "I chose to help him because I thought he would make a good leader, and I still think that is the case. Sure, he might have acted a little high and mighty with us in the throne room, but he hasn't broken any of his promises yet, and it still looks like he intends to do everything in his power to honor our agreement. That alone is enough for me to give him the benefit of the doubt."

"Yeah, I suppose you're right," Hadrik says. "He did say that he would find a way to free the prisoners from the towers after all. I guess we're going to have to wait and see what he does in the next few weeks, then."

}
 Soon after we get out of the palace, we hear Flower gasping loudly, while she is still being carried by Melindra's air currents.

"I think I got it!" Flower says, in a loud voice. "Melindra, can you put me down for a second?"

"Huh?" Melindra says. "Oh yeah, sure."

She then waves her hands towards her, and Flower is gently lowered to the ground.

"Thanks!" Flower says. "Alright, here I go. Wish me luck!"

Before any of us have the time to ask what she's doing, Flower begins to squeeze her fists really hard, while her arms are trembling in front of her. As she is apparently gathering every ounce of focus that she has in order to concentrate on her current task, her eyes begin to gradually turn back to their normal green color, while the invisible burning flames in her aura also seem to be slowly getting extinguished.

A few seconds later, Flower returns completely back to normal, with a big smile on her face.

"Hah!" she says, happily. "I did it! I can't believe I managed to do it! I have it all under control, now! Look!"

She then squeezes her fists again, and her eyes begin to turn back to their glowy red color from earlier. Right in the middle of her transformation, her eyes turn blue all of a sudden and Flower smacks herself in the head very hard, which causes her eyes to turn back to normal immediately.

 "One minute!" Illuna says. "All I ask is for one minute without you doing something stupid! Can you not at least rest a little before you transform again? What if you got stuck again, and couldn't turn back? What then?"

"Sorry!" Flower says. "I guess I just wanted to brag a little. I won't do it again, I promise!"

"You can practice your transformations all you like after you get a good night's sleep," Illuna says. "All I'm asking is that you don't take this lightly. You've been doing high-distance teleportation throughout the ethereal plane all day. It's a miracle that you didn't reach your limit yet. Let's try not to tempt fate any more than we already have, shall we?"

"Yes, Petal," Flower says. "I understand."

"Good," Illuna says.

"Can I say just one more thing?" Flower says.

"What?" Illuna asks, in an apprehensive tone.

"Now that we're done with the coronation and everything," Flower says, "could we maybe pay a really quick visit to that building from Ollendor where Melindra told me that there's a puzzle piece lying in wait?"

"Unbelievable..." Illuna says. "After everything we've been through, you're still thinking about your puzzle pieces..."

 There were four candidates in total: the king of the underground, two rebels whose names I never heard mentioned until now, and Albert.

Each of the candidates climbed on a makeshift podium and gave short speeches before the voting commenced, although the two no-name rebels seemed to have made very little impact on the crowd, because there was barely anyone cheering for them at the end. Something tells me that neither of them will be offering much competition to the king of the underground in this contest.

At the moment, our group is standing somewhere in the back of the large room, so that we can discuss things freely without disturbing the other people who came here to spectate the election.

"Do you think Albert has any chance of winning this fair and square?" Hadrik says. "Most people would probably see him as an extension of the king of the underground by now, wouldn't they? Why would they vote for the flunkey instead of the boss himself?"

"Albert used to be one of the main rebel leaders before he started serving the king of the underground, and I don't think most of the rebels forgot that," Daren says. "I'm sure that many of them would relish the opportunity to place their old leader into a position of power again."

"Yes," Daren says. "They'll be voted by the people who hate the king of the underground enough that they'd rather have anyone else in charge."

"Mhm..." Melindra says. "And then the haters' votes will be split between the two of them, so even if there are more people who hate the king of the underground than the ones who like him, he'll still come out on top. Let's face it, there's no way the king could realistically lose this contest."

"Do you think Kelrim will win this if there's no interference?" Hadrik asks Daren.

"Almost certainly," Daren says. "You saw how much support he got from the people when it was first announced that he'd be running for king. To be frank, I would have expected the king of the underground to try to assassinate him by now, considering how much of a threat he was to his rule. The only reason I can think of for why he hasn't done it already is that he must be extremely confident in his ability to cheat in this election. That's why I'm being extra cautious right now."

"Hmm... I suppose you do have a point," Hadrik says. "Let's keep our eyes peeled, then."

}
 Not long after our discussion, the men in charge of gathering the votes pass by us and collect our voting papers. We all paid close attention to what they were doing, but even though the crowd of people obscured our view a few times, it didn't seem like they had the opportunity to switch such a large number of votes without us noticing. Once the votes have been gathered, the men placed the papers on the podium and then they started counting them, while several supposedly neutral observers were checking on them, to make sure that they were doing the count correctly.

"Do you think they could just fake the counting?" Hadrik says. "I have no idea who those observers are supposed to be. Can they be trusted?"

 "I asked around," Daren says, "and apparently they are all people with strong reasons to dislike the king of the underground, who have been insisting that they should be allowed to oversee the voting process since yesterday. Normally, it should be almost impossible for the vote counters to cheat while having those guys looking over their shoulders constantly."

"So, this is it, then?" Hadrik says. "We can stop watching their every move?"

"I suppose so," Daren says.

"Good," Hadrik says, looking slightly relieved. "It was getting a little stressful!"

 "Hey, Melindra, can you move me a little closer to the podium?" Flower says, as she is floating slightly above the ground, being carried by Melindra's air currents, while her eyes are glowing red. "I want to have a better look at the vote counting!"

"Sorry, but the crowd is simply too big," Melindra says. "My currents aren't really precise enough for me to properly navigate you through this place without you constantly bumping into people."

"Ugh..." Flower says. "This would be so much easier if I could just move by myself. Petal, can Melindra put me down just for a little bit so I can get closer to the podium? Pretty please?"

"No," Illuna says, as Flower's eyes now begin to glow with a bright blue color, to signify that Illuna is the one talking. "We both agreed that you won't be moving by yourself until you can undo your transformation that makes your eyes glow and your aura burn. It's too risky for you to make any sort of physical effort on this plane of existence, considering how much strain your evolved state is likely putting on your body. If you want to walk by yourself, then you should try putting all of your efforts into finding a way to turn back to normal instead of complaining."

"But I have been trying to do that!" Flower says. "I've been trying really hard! Don't you think I deserve a little break?"

 "You're not getting any breaks until I see your eyes turning back from red to green," Illuna says. "Now get back to work."

"Fine..." Flower says. "I'll see what I can do."

"Don't you think you're being a little harsh on her?" Kate asks Illuna, once the color of her eyes turns blue again.

"I'm doing this for her own good," Illuna says. "The more time she spends in this evolved state of hers, the more risky it gets. If she doesn't learn to transform herself back to normal at will, she could easily burn herself out. This isn't a matter that we can just put on hold until later. It's very serious."

"I understand that, but... isn't there some way you could help her?" Kate says.

"Unfortunately, no," Illuna says. "I do not have much knowledge about ethereals, and Arraka hasn't exactly been of much help either. Right now, Flower is the only one who can figure out what happened to her, and how to undo the transformation."

"So, I'm just throwing around ideas here," Hadrik says, "but don't you think you might have a better chance of getting help from Arraka if you would open her locket?"

 "That is indeed a possibility," Illuna says, as she looks at the amulet hanging from her neck, from which we can hear the continuous muffled sound of Arraka trying to shout at us. "Let us test out your hypothesis."

She then briefly opens the amulet's locket, so that we can hear what Arraka has to say.

"--and when I'm done with your families, I will kill you in the slowest, most painful way you can imagine!" we hear Arraka shouting. "Your eyes will melt from your face, while your heads will feel like they are exploding a thousand times per second--"

"It looks like your hypothesis was slightly incorrect," Illuna says, after she closes back the locket. "Arraka did not in fact become more helpful when I opened up the amulet. Perhaps a little spinning could make her slightly more cooperative. Would anyone care to give it a try?"

 After hearing Illuna's question, we all exchange a few looks, but in the end nobody decides to take her up on her offer.

"Really?..." Illuna says. "No one? Not even Hadrik?"

"Well," Hadrik says, "Arraka did kind of do me a favor by keeping the details of my trial from the God of Time's ritual a secret, so spinning her now would leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."

"Yeah, and she's also been very cooperative as of late," Daren says. "I know that it's because we now share the common goal of fighting against a god, but still, with the way Arraka has been acting lately, and with all the effort that she's put into coaching each one of us, it's almost starting to feel like she is legitimately on her way to becoming an invaluable part of the team."

 "Part of the team?!" Illuna says, incredulous, as Arraka seems to have finally become quiet, after hearing Daren's words. "You can't be serious!"

She then pauses for a few seconds, to take a good look at each of us in turn.

"Please tell me that the rest of you don't also agree with him!" Illuna says.

"I mean, to be fair, we didn't really see Arraka do anything wrong this time," Hadrik says. "We were all still in the ethereal plane when you decided to close her amulet because she was annoying you. Unless there's something I'm missing, none of us should have any real reason to spin--"

"I'm not talking about the spinning anymore," Illuna says. "I'm talking about her being part of the team! Do any of you really think that? Do you genuinely think that she could ever be on your side?"

"Illuna..." Kate says. "Right now, like it or not, we ARE on the same side. At least until this whole conflict with the God of Time gets resolved. I thought we had all already agreed that we would accept her help."

}
#if(v_b3_ch10_spin == 1) {
 "Sure thing," I say. "Give her to me!"

After Illuna takes off the amulet and hands it over to me, I begin spinning it by the chain, making the speed faster with each rotation. As the speed intensifies, so does the sound of Arraka's raging screams, which are still being suppressed by the closed locket.

"Barry..." Kate says. "I think that's enough."

"It is?" I ask, surprised, as I slowly stop spinning the amulet. "That's strange. I never got the impression that you cared much for Arraka. How come you're standing up for her?"

"I'm not standing up for her," Kate says. "I'm just saying it may not be wise to further antagonize the person that is currently helping us."

"Helping us?" I ask. "You mean with the training to fight the God of Time? Hey, that's as much in her interest as it is in ours. She already admitted that she is personally invested in this plan of using us to exact her revenge upon the gods. She's not going to give up on it just because of a little spinning."

"Barry is correct," Illuna says. "If you are worried that Arraka will suddenly stop training you just because of a little spat, then I can assure you that this is not the case. She may grumble a bit at first, but in the end she will continue to cooperate with you like before. This plan is too important for her to allow it to fail because of such childish reasons."

 "Yeah, but it's not just about the training," Daren says. "Her overall behavior has changed a lot as well. She's been cracking far less jokes at our expense lately, and she even helped me deal with the plague from the underground base. Frankly, with the way she's been contributing to our efforts in the last few days, I'd dare to say that she may legitimately be on her way to becoming an invaluable part of the team."

"Part of the team?!" Illuna says, incredulous, as Arraka seems to have finally become quiet, after hearing Daren's words. "You can't be serious!"

She then pauses for a few seconds, to take a good look at each of us in turn.

"Please tell me that the rest of you don't also agree with him!" Illuna says.

"Illuna..." Kate says. "Right now, like it or not, we ARE on the same side. At least until this whole conflict with the God of Time gets resolved. I thought we had all already agreed that we would accept her help."

}
 "Accepting her help and treating her as if she is truly an ally are two completely different things," Illuna says. "When I agreed to have her train us, it was under the assumption that we would all know who we are dealing with. Regardless of how helpful Arraka is, she is NOT to be trusted. Please tell me that you understand this."

"Look," Daren says, "nobody is saying that we should suddenly become friends with her, hold hands and sing happy songs together. We're just saying that in the past few days she's changed slightly for the better, that's all."

"No, she has NOT changed," Illuna says, in a louder voice, as she is now finally losing her cool. "She will never change! She will always be the same ruthless, sadistic and manipulative mass murderer that she has been since long before she even came to the earthen plane. You cannot afford to treat her like an ally. You cannot afford to even consider that possibility. Do not make the same mistake I did! I guarantee you that you will regret it for as long as you'll live!"

We all nod slowly in agreement without saying anything else, as we are still in somewhat of a shock after having seen Illuna's sudden outburst. It is not often that we see Illuna losing her calm and collected demeanor like this, and if I'm not mistaken, the only times I've ever seen her get so upset it has always been because of Arraka. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me, given their past together.

"Very well," Illuna says, now in a slightly more reserved tone. "I just wanted to make sure that we are all on the same page, that's all. Let's pay attention to the podium. I think they might be about to announce the winner."

 Not long afterwards, the vote counters announce the victor, and to our surprise, Albert was the one who won.

"Albert won?!" Hadrik says, as Albert is now going up on the podium to give his victory speech. "Seriously? Him of all people?"

"I told you that you shouldn't dismiss him just because he's the king of the underground's right hand man," Daren says. "It looks like the people around here had a much better opinion of him than the rest of us."

"Yeah," Hadrik says. "Either that, or they REALLY hated the king of the underground."

 The victory speech lasts for a short while longer, and it is followed by a round of applause, as well as several cheers coming from the people in front of us. Once the election is officially over, the crowd begins to slowly disperse, while we stay behind to see what the king of the underground is doing. When he notices us looking at him, the king of the underground nods at us from a distance, and then he walks over to our corner of the room, so that he can talk to us.

"I was wondering if you would be joining us or not..." the king of the underground says, as soon as he stops next to us. "Tell me, did you enjoy the election?"

"More than we thought we would, to be honest," Daren says. "I don't think any of us were expecting Albert to actually win."

"You weren't?" the king of the underground asks, surprised "Why not? Albert has always been a well-respected figure around these parts. I think most people were expecting this to be a close race, at the very least."

"Yeah," Hadrik says, "but we sort of assumed that you would come up with some last minute trick to change the results in your favor, so that you wouldn't be forced to give away all your power."

"You thought I was going to rig the election?" the king of the underground says, looking genuinely shocked. "I was aware that you had a very low opinion of me, but I never imagined it would be this bad."

"Hey, don't act like you're some kind of saint," I say. "Don't forget that we know you were planning to have us assassinated!"

 Not long afterwards, the vote counters announce the victor, and to our surprise, Peter was the one who won.

"Peter won?..." Hadrik says, as Peter is now going up on the podium to give his victory speech. "Now that is a pleasant surprise! How in the world did that happen?"

"I told you that he was very well-liked around here," Daren says. "First impressions can be deceiving sometimes. He may have looked a little wishy-washy to us, from the few interactions we had with him, but we have to remember that he was still one of the three rebel leaders. Clearly, these people must know another side of him that is unfamiliar to us."

"Well, as far as I'm concerned, anyone is better than the king of the underground," Hadrik says, "but Peter isn't a particularly bad choice, if you ask me. I'm glad that he's the one who ended up winning!"

"Yeah, me too," Daren says. "Of all the choices available, he was clearly the best one."

"Let's just hope that he isn't as spineless as he appears," Kate says, "and that he won't still be taking orders from the king of the underground even after he is appointed as king of Ollendor."

"Ah, don't worry about it!" Hadrik says. "I'm sure he'll do fine!"

 Not long afterwards, the vote counters announce the victor, and to nobody's surprise, the king of the underground was the one who won. As the king gets up on the podium to give his victory speech, Daren turns towards us again, with a visibly unhappy look on his face.

"Well..." Daren says. "We can't say that we weren't expecting this, but that still doesn't make things any less disappointing."

"Hey, maybe he won't be that bad as a ruler," Hadrik says. "Just because we don't like his personality, it doesn't mean that he has poor leadership skills."

"It's not his leadership skills that I'm worried about, but rather his intentions," Daren says. "Either way, there's nothing we can do about it now. In a way, it's also our fault for not being able to come up with a candidate proposal good enough to properly compete with him, so we can't really complain."

"To be fair, we've only been here for a few days," Hadrik says. "We barely know these people. Maybe it's better that we didn't involve ourselves too much in their election. We already interfered enough as it is."

"Yeah..." Daren says. "Perhaps you're right."

"Listen..." the king of the underground says. "I realize that I may not have been the ideal choice for you, but I assure you that things will turn out for the better, despite your misgivings."

"Things will turn out for the better?" Hadrik asks. "Better for whom?"

"For the people of Ollendor," the king of the underground says.

"Mhm..." Hadrik says, skeptically. "I'm sure they will."

"Yeah, I never thought it could be this easy..." Daren says, looking as if he's still not done recovering from the shock. "Has the king of the underground really made no effort whatsoever to win this election through dishonest means?"

"Maybe he was overconfident in his success," Hadrik says.

"No, that's impossible!" Daren says. "He saw with his own eyes how many people wanted Kelrim to be king. He couldn't have been that blind. I don't get it. Could we really have misjudged him this whole time?"

"Well, the election's technically not over yet, so let's keep a lookout just in case," Hadrik says. "You never know what might happen."

"Obviously, I'm not exactly pleased with the results, but what was I to do?" the king of the underground says. "Have him killed?"

"Well... yes, actually," Daren says. "Isn't that what you do around here?"

"You thought I was going to have the goblin assassinated?!" the king of the underground says, looking genuinely shocked. "Dear gods, I always knew that you had a very low opinion of me, but I never imagined it would be this bad."

 "Umm... Kelrim!" Kate says, a little awkwardly. "I don't know if this is the right time, but there's something very important that I need to ask you about. Do you know of the mage prisoners from the seredium towers?"

"Yes..." Kelrim says, looking very distraught. "Breynan told me about them. Those poor people... I can't imagine what they must be going through, even as we speak..."

"Have you thought about what you are going to do with them, once you become king of Ollendor?" Kate asks him.

"I'm going to free them all, of course!" Kelrim says. "As soon as possible! They have already suffered enough!"

"Have you spoken to the king of the underground about this?" Kate says. "His point of view is that if all the prisoners were to be released at once, it would cause too much chaos throughout the city, because all of the magically-powered devices will stop working, including the flying vehicles. His plan was to only free the relatives of the people from the underground, and to leave the other prisoners there until later."

 "No, no, no, they must all be freed!" Kelrim says. "That will be our number one priority! If this will cause chaos, then we'll just have to find the best way to manage it! In fact, I think I'll go speak to the king of the underground about this right now!"

"Uh... can I speak to him about this instead?" Sir Horace asks Kelrim. "I've known him for a very long time, so I'm sure that I can convince him to cooperate with us on this matter. He might disagree to it at first, but eventually he'll find some way to make things work. He always does."

"Of course!" Kelrim says. "Then I'll leave this matter in your hands for now, Sir Horace!"

"Make sure not to remove the prisoners' chains by force, or they will die!" Kate says. "You need to go to the control room first, in order to deactivate the energy extracting devices!"

"We'll keep that in mind," Sir Horace says. "Alright, your majesty, now that you've been elected as king, we'll need to have our first strategy meeting. Follow me, if you please."

"Okay, lead the way!" Kelrim says, as he follows Sir Horace out of the room. "Bye, everyone! I'll see you again soon!"

"See?" Daren tells Kate, after Kelrim leaves. "There was nothing to worry about! All of the prisoners are going to be safe!"

"Yes..." Kate says, in a relieved tone. "I'm glad!"

 "Didn't the king of the underground say that they were planning to rescue all of the prisoners, in the end?" Daren says. "It's just that some will be rescued sooner than others."

"Yes, but what if they never find an alternative power source?" Kate says. "Will those imprisoned mages stay there forever?"

"All we can do is take his word for it that they will do their best to free everyone, eventually," Daren says. "We were the ones who put the rebels in charge of the city, so we're going to have to trust their judgment for now."

"You're right..." Kate says. "We were the ones who sided with them against the Overseer. I just hope that we didn't make the wrong decision..."

 "So, what do we do now?" Hadrik says. "Do we stay here in these caverns, or...?"

"I think we should go to the surface and do some shopping, for now," Daren says. "It's probably going to be a while before we visit another city."

"Agreed," Kate says. "Let's go to the teleporter room. I think I saw the new teleporting engineer heading out of this room earlier, so we should most likely find him at his post." 

We spend the next ten minutes or so walking to the teleporter room and talking about the election. Once we reach our destination, the teleporting engineer that replaced Barry Thundercloud hits a few buttons on his control panel and he sends us to the surface, in the middle of a shopping district.

From the looks of things, it seems that some of the citizens have already noticed that the lockdown was over, because there were a few people entering the shops here and there, even if not that many. As we are still deciding which shop to visit first, we suddenly hear Flower gasping loudly, while she is still being carried by Melindra's air currents.

"I think I got it!" Flower says, in a loud voice. "Melindra, can you put me down for a second?"

"Huh?" Melindra says. "Oh yeah, sure."

 She then waves her hands towards her, and Flower is gently lowered to the ground.

"Thanks!" Flower says. "Alright, here I go. Wish me luck!"

Before any of us have the time to ask what she's doing, Flower begins to squeeze her fists really hard, while her arms are trembling in front of her. As she is apparently gathering every ounce of focus that she has in order to concentrate on her current task, her eyes begin to gradually turn back to their normal green color, while the invisible burning flames in her aura also seem to be slowly getting extinguished.

A few seconds later, Flower returns completely back to normal, with a big smile on her face.

"Hah!" she says, happily. "I did it! I can't believe I managed to do it! I have it all under control, now! Look!"

She then squeezes her fists again, and her eyes begin to turn back to their glowy red color from earlier. Right in the middle of her transformation, her eyes turn blue all of a sudden and Flower smacks herself in the head very hard, which causes her eyes to turn back to normal immediately.

"One minute!" Illuna says. "All I ask is for one minute without you doing something stupid! Can you not at least rest a little before you transform again? What if you got stuck again, and couldn't turn back? What then?"

 "Sorry!" Flower says. "I guess I just wanted to brag a little. I won't do it again, I promise!"

"You can practice your transformations all you like after you get a good night's sleep," Illuna says. "All I'm asking is that you don't take this lightly. You've been doing high-distance teleportation throughout the ethereal plane all day. It's a miracle that you didn't reach your limit yet. Let's try not to tempt fate any more than we already have, shall we?"

"Yes, Petal," Flower says. "I understand."

"Good," Illuna says.

"Can I say just one more thing?" Flower says.

"What?" Illuna asks, in an apprehensive tone.

"Now that we're done with the election and everything," Flower says, "could we maybe pay a really quick visit to that building from Ollendor where Melindra told me that there's a puzzle piece lying in wait?"

"Unbelievable..." Illuna says. "After everything we've been through, you're still thinking about your puzzle pieces..."

"So you both want to get the puzzle pieces?" Hadrik says. "What's so special about these puzzle pieces anyway?"

"I have no idea," I say. "But that's what makes it more interesting!"

"You're coming too?" Flower asks me. "That's great! Melindra, can you show us where we need to go?"

"Hey now, wait a minute!" Daren says. "You guys are not planning to go there alone, are you?"

"Why not?" Flower asks. "The fight for Ollendor is over. Shouldn't it be safe to wander around the city at this point?"

"Technically, yes, but we can't forget that there are still some royal guards left alive," Daren says. "What if they want to avenge their fallen king?"

"Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about them," I say. "Loyrang has most likely already fled the city by now, and that illusionist guy can't do anything on his own."

"Yes, but those royal guards had apprentices too," Daren says. "Maybe we should all go with you, just to be sure."

"It will take hours to get there on foot," Melindra says. "We can get there much faster by flying."

 "Ready!" I say, as Kate and Flower nod their heads as well.

"Okay," Melindra says. "Let's fly!"

As soon as Melindra gives us the go ahead, we all launch into the sky through our own flying methods, we say goodbye temporarily to our friends on the ground, and we head towards the building with the puzzle piece in it. Since we are flying at a relatively high speed and the wind is constantly blowing in our ears, we don't really talk much during our short trip, except for when Melindra gives us directions.

When we are about halfway there, I suddenly feel an eerily familiar sensation of dizziness, and then my perspective switches to that of my soul on the ethereal plane, sitting in the empty cube that is my sanctuary. When I regain my senses on the earthen plane, a few seconds later, I realize that I've lost control of my air currents and that I am falling down, rapidly.

I quickly move my arms up to stop myself from dropping, and then I just float there for several moments, as a slight feeling of anxiousness is beginning to slowly take over me.

It's happening again... Why is this happening? Wasn't it just a fluke the last time?

"That's fine, because I wasn't going to give you one anyway!" Flower tells me, as she frowns and sticks out her tongue.

Does that sound good to you?"

"Everyone who can fly...?" Daren asks, as he spends a few seconds thinking about Melindra's proposal. "Yeah, that might not be such a bad idea. So, that would leave me, Hadrik and Leila for the shopping team, correct?"

"I think so," Melindra says. "Kate, you can fly over long distances with your ice platforms, as long as you're not carrying somebody else with you, right?"

"Yes, I can," Kate says.

 As I take a quick look around, I notice that everyone is staring at me. Should I tell them about what happened?

No, I'll just make them worry over nothing. I'm sure that I must only be having some small trouble adjusting my perspective after all those times when the ether forced my consciousness to go back and forth between the ethereal and earthen planes. If I give it one more day, this sensation will probably go away by itself. It has to!

"No, it's nothing!" I say. "I was just testing some flight maneuvers and I messed up a little. All good!"

"Well, don't try anything too dangerous," Melindra says. "There are some really oddly-shaped rooftops below. You wouldn't want to crash into any of them, trust me!"

"Yeah, I'll try to be more careful!" I say, and then I start to follow Melindra through the sky again, along with the others.

We continue our journey for a while longer, and during this time, the sensation of my consciousness switching between planes does not happen to me anymore.

It's fine. I have this under control. A few seconds here and there of going back to the ethereal plane is not that big of a deal. I'll only start worrying if things get worse.

 Before I get the time to think about this any longer, Melindra tells us that we've arrived at our destination, and she signals us to land in front of a very old-looking building. Unlike all the other buildings with crazy designs made by Billy Bob, this particular house looks refreshingly simple, just like any other house that you'd expect to see inside a city.

"Oh, good!" Melindra says, once we're all on the ground. "The old house is still here. I was a little worried that they might have demolished it by now. Okay, let's go inside. I'll show you how to open the passage to the ruins below."

"Ruins?..." Flower asks, confused, as we are now entering the building. "I thought you said that the puzzle piece was supposed to be inside the house!"

"No," Melindra says. "What I told you was that you needed to go inside the abandoned building in order to get to the puzzle piece. I never said that it was hidden in the building itself. Anyway, it's just some lousy ruins. I already know which levers we need to pull, so it will be over in a few minutes. Don't worry about it."

"And what if you remember the levers wrong?" Kate asks her.

"I am not remembering them wrong," Melindra says, while she presses on a few stones from the ground in quick succession. "I've already done this a few times before, so I know exactly what I'm doing."

Just as she is done talking, the middle of the floor opens itself up, revealing a hidden staircase to us.

 "See?" Melindra says. "I told you that I know what I'm doing. Alright, now we need to take these stairs all the way down. Come on!"

"Are there any blue crystals down there, or do we need some light?" Flower asks Melindra, as we begin to descend the stairs.

"No, there are no crystals, as far as I recall," Melindra says, "but I think there are some torches that we can light."

"Gotcha!" Flower says, as she conjures three small balls of flame that are floating next to us, so that we can see where we're going.

Once we reach the ruins below, Flower uses her balls of fire to light all of the torches on the walls, and then she makes her magic flames disappear.

"Wow, that's a lot of levers..." Flower says, when she gets a good look at the corridor walls.

"Okay, pay attention!" Melindra says. "There's a very specific order in which these levers need to be pulled, with some waiting times in-between. I will handle all of it, but when I get to the final lever, whoever wants a puzzle piece will need to stand over there, by the wall, because the puzzle piece dispenser will only be available for a short time. Got it?"

"Got it!" Flower says.

"Good," says Melindra. "Here I go, then."

"Alright, now we need to wait for about a minute or so," Melindra says.

"Right," Flower tells her.

After Flower says this, there is an awkward silence for about ten seconds, during which none of us lets out a single word.

"So..." Melindra says out of the blue, as she turns towards me and Kate. "Are the two of you going out together yet, or not?"

"What?!" Kate says, looking extremely embarrassed. "Where did that come from? Why would you even ask us something like that?"

"Oh come on, Kate!" Melindra says. "It's obvious that you have at least some feelings for him! Why not just be honest for once? I guarantee you that you would feel a lot better if you told him the truth!"

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Kate says, as she is trying hard to remain calm. "There is nothing going on between me and Barry."

"Is that so?" Melindra says, with a smirk. "So, do you hate him then?"

"I... never said that I hate him..." Kate says.

 "But you don't like him?" Melindra asks.

"I didn't say that either!" Kate says.

"So, you do like him then?" Melindra says, with half a grin.

"Can you just stop teasing me and go pull the lever?" Kate says. "Your minute is almost up!"

"Alright, alright," Melindra says, with a smile, as she heads towards one of the levers. "No need to get upset. I won't say anything else... for now."

As Melindra is busy pulling on one of the levers at the farther end of the corridor, Kate is just standing there, looking in front of her, with her face completely red from embarrassment.

"What?" Kate says, staring daggers at me when she notices me looking at her.

"What do you mean?" I say, trying to play dumb.

"Oh, you know very well what I mean!" Melindra says. "I saw you acting awkwardly around each other after your last night shift together. It's clear that something happened between the two of you."

"Of course..." Kate says, looking as if she's had a sudden revelation. "Now it all makes perfect sense!"

"What makes sense?" I ask.

 "Just the other day, before your night shift with her, Leila kept asking me if there was really nothing going on between you and me, and she even made me confirm this to her multiple times," Kate tells me. "I think she wanted to make sure that she wouldn't hurt my feelings, if you two got together..."

"Huh..." I say. "That was really thoughtful of her."

"She really cares about you, you know..." Kate says to me. "Make sure that you don't let her down."

"I know," I say. "I won't."

"I'll be right back," Melindra says. "I need to go pull the next lever."

"No, it's not just you," I say. "When I first met her father, she very clearly told him that you and I were in a relationship, so it's pretty obvious that this is the impression we've given her."

"But why would she think that?" Melindra asks, looking genuinely confused. "Is it because we've had sex?"

"I imagine that this would probably be the main reason, yes," I answer her.

 "Huh..." Melindra says.

She then pauses to ponder on my words for a few seconds, before she continues.

"Listen," she tells me, "I've got nothing against you. It's just that... you know... it's kind of been my policy for a very long time to not get too attached to people, since I always end up outliving them and then they leave me behind. It really is nothing personal!"

"Sure, don't worry about it!" I say.

Once more, there is a short period of time in which nobody says anything.

"Actually, there was this one time, many years ago..." Melindra says, after thinking things over for a few more seconds. "I used to travel with a male friend for a few years, and we were... sort of in a relationship, but not really. We would share a tent, we would spend most of our time together, but there were no attachments. We had a rule that we wouldn't be getting together with anyone else during this time, but that was it! No other obligations."

 "Isn't that literally the definition of a relationship, though?" I ask her.

"No!" Melindra says, maybe a little too loudly. "It's not! There were no other strings attached! We could walk out on each other any day, and there would be no hard feelings between us! We even remained friends for a long time after we stopped seeing each other. It wasn't a bad arrangement, now that I think about it..."

She pauses again.

"So... would you like something like that?" Melindra asks me, as she is looking straight into my eyes.

"You mean... you and me?" I say, trying to make sure that I'm fully understanding what she is implying. "Travelling together? Sharing a tent? No strings attached?"

"Yes," Melindra says simply, as she is still waiting for my answer.

"Uh... sort of," I say.

"He made a promise that he'd come back to her after he wins the tournament," Kate says.

"Hmm..." Melindra says. "But I'm pretty sure that I heard Hadrik mention at some point how this 'Rose' said that her involvement with Barry was only for one night. Doesn't this mean that Rose didn't have much interest in him, aside from that one night?"

 "It's not like that..." Kate says. "I spoke to her about this, and she admitted to me that the only reason why she said such a thing was because she didn't want Barry to feel guilty about leaving her behind in Thilias. She thought that if she told him about her feelings for him, he might have had second thoughts about the tournament and she didn't want him to give up on his lifelong dream of becoming a mage because of her."

"So you are certain that Rose has feelings for him, then?" Melindra says.

"Yes, I'm sure of it," Kate says.

"Alright," Melindra says. "That's all I wanted to know. Thanks for sharing that with me!"

"You're welcome," Kate says.

"I think it's time for me to pull the next lever," Melindra says. "I'll be right back."

Melindra then goes to the farther end of the corridor and she pulls one of the levers from the left wall.

}
 All of a sudden, I get a splitting headache, and my consciousness gets switched between the ethereal and earthen planes several times in a row, in quick succession, very similarly to how it happened when the ether was attacking me. Just when I thought it was over, the same thing happens again, except that I go back and forth between the two planes more than ten times in one second.

"Barry, what's wrong?" Kate asks me, now looking very worried. "Did somebody cast a dizziness spell on you?"

"No, it's not a dizziness spell, it's-- argh..."

The headache takes over me again, and I spend a good few moments alternating between my soul's and my body's perspectives constantly. I think this time I may have switched between the two planes at least a hundred times.

"Do you have any idea what's causing this?" Kate asks me. "Does it feel like a normal headache, or is it something else?"

 "Hey, that sounds good to me," I say. "Let's give it a try!"

"Great!" Melindra says.

"So, does this mean that we're going to start sharing a tent from now on, or...?" I ask her.

"Oh, no, not while we're still travelling with everyone else!" Melindra says. "That would just make things awkward!"

"You didn't seem to think it was awkward when we did it before..." I tell her.

"Yes, but that was back when I didn't really give a damn about Kate, since I barely even knew her," Melindra says. "She and I are friends now. It's different!"

 "It's fine, Melindra..." Kate says. "You don't need to worry about making me uncomfortable."

"Nonsense!" Melindra says. "Barry and I will have plenty of time to travel together and share tents. There's no reason for us to go out of our way and do that now, when the tournament isn't even over yet. Isn't that right, Barry?"

"Uh, sure..." I say. "Yeah..."

"Alright, I think it's time for me to pull the next lever," Melindra says. "I'll be right back."

Melindra then goes to the farther end of the corridor and she pulls one of the levers from the left wall.

 "To be honest, I'm not sure if this type of relationship is really what I'm looking for," I say.

"Alright, suit yourself," Melindra says, while shrugging.

 "No hard feelings, right?" I say.

"None whatsoever," she says, and then she goes to pull on another lever.

}
 All of a sudden, I get a splitting headache, and my consciousness gets switched between the ethereal and earthen planes several times in a row, in quick succession, very similarly to how it happened when the ether was attacking me. Just when I thought it was over, the same thing happens again, except that I go back and forth between the two planes more than ten times in one second.

"Barry, what's wrong?" Kate asks me, now looking very worried. "Did somebody cast a dizziness spell on you?"

"No, it's not a dizziness spell, it's-- argh..."

The headache takes over me again, and I spend a good few moments alternating between my soul's and my body's perspectives constantly. I think this time I may have switched between the two planes at least a hundred times.

"Do you have any idea what's causing this?" Kate asks me. "Does it feel like a normal headache, or is it something else?"

"What's happening?" Melindra asks.

"He's having a headache," Kate tells her.

"Oh, is that what happened back there when we were flying?" Melindra says. "He got a headache and lost control of the air currents?"

 "Barry, did you have the same headache before?" Kate says. "Barry, can you hear me?"

As Kate and Melindra are talking, I am finding it harder and harder to concentrate on what they are saying. Not only that, but I feel like everything is getting darker, both on the earthen plane and on the ethereal plane. While the lights are fading before my eyes, a sudden sensation of weakness takes over me, and soon I don't even have the strength to open my mouth anymore. A few seconds later, the only thing I can see before me is pure darkness, and then I lose my consciousness for good.

 "I'm not sure what's happening," I say. "I keep getting sent back and forth between the earthen plane and the ethereal plane, and it's giving me these awful headaches. I think I'm having trouble readjusting to being back on the earthen plane, but I don't know why."

"Oh, no..." Flower says. "Oh, no. Oh no! Barry, close your eyes! Close your eyes quick and keep them closed! Do it now!"

"Okay, I'm closing them, I'm closing them!" I say, as I close my eyes just like she said. "Now what?"

"I don't know!" I can hear Flower saying.

"What do you mean you don't know?" I ask her.

"Barry, I think the abyss is trying to pull you back in," Flower says, in a panicky voice.

"The abyss?" I say. "You mean the ethereal abyss? The place made of pure darkness where you sent me to escape from the ether?"

"Yes!" Flower says. "Remember how you couldn't manage to return to your sanctuary by yourself from there, and Petal had to pour some cold water on you on the earthen plane in order to wake you up?"

"I remember, yeah," I say.

 "Well, that wasn't the proper way to do it," Flower says. "Petal only did it as an extreme measure, because you couldn't wake up by yourself, and we were hoping that it would be enough, but I'm starting to think that it wasn't."

"So, what does that mean?..." I say, while my eyes are still closed. "What do I do now?"

"Umm... maybe you could... live the rest of your life with your eyes closed?" Flower says, in a meek voice.

"What?!" I shout.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Flower says, in a panicky voice again. "It's just that this has never happened before. I have no idea what you should do! The only thing I know is that as long as you keep your eyes closed both here and on the ethereal plane, the abyss shouldn't be able to hurt you."

She pauses.

"You do have your eyes closed on the ethereal plane too, don't you?..." Flower asks.

"How am I supposed to know that?" I say. "I can't check if I'm still switching between the planes while I have my eyes closed!"

 "Yeah, but can't you feel it?" Flower says. "With your magical sense, I mean?"

"I can't differentiate the auras from the ethereal plane from the ones on the earthen plane!" I say. "I wouldn't even know what difference to look for! Isn't there anything else I can do? Anything at all?"

"Okay, well... you're not dead yet, so that's a good start..." Flower says, with her voice still shaky. "Maybe if we-- Maybe if I-- if I--"

"Flower, calm down," I hear Flower's voice again, but this time in the tone of Illuna. "Think about this rationally. The abyss cannot affect the ether any more than the ether can affect the abyss. Even if the abyss wanted to bring him back, there would be no way for it to reach him."

"Then how is this happening?" Flower says, still sounding panicked.

"A small piece of darkness must have travelled with him when he made the return trip," Illuna says. "Considering that he's not already dead after all this time, my guess is that the darkness has attached itself to the exterior of his sanctuary and it's trying to make its way in. If you can reach Barry's mind from the ethereal plane, you should easily be able to cleanse the darkness with your fire."

"But I don't know where Barry's mind is!" Flower says. "We never reached it the last time when I tried to lead him there!"

 "Barry, listen to me closely," Illuna tells me. "Your eyes might be closed, but you still have your hearing, and you still have your sense of touch. Normally, the inside of your sanctuary should feel different to the touch than the floor and the walls from these ruins. Try sitting on the ground here, and then touch it with your hands. If you are being tossed around between the two planes of existence, you should feel the texture of the floor change beneath your palms."

"Good idea," I say, with my eyes still closed. "I'll do that right now!"

Almost immediately after I sit down on the floor and put my palms on it, I can feel the ground changing rapidly between the cold hard stone of the underground corridor to a warm, soft texture that I've never felt before. It's working! I now know that I'm still switching!

"Okay, I can confirm that I'm still being sent back and forth between the two planes," I say. "What do you want me to do?"

"I want you to concentrate on your palms," Illuna says, "and to imagine that you are sending magical energy throughout the whole cube that you are currently inside of, in the ethereal plane. Do you think you can do that?"

"Yeah, I think I can," I say, as I try to do what Illuna said.

"In the meantime, Flower, you're going to need to transform back into your evolved state and see if you can detect a sanctuary with magic overflowing from it," Illuna says.

 "But you said that I shouldn't transform again until--" Flower says, but she is interrupted.

"Never mind what I said," Illuna tells her. "This is an emergency. If you know how to turn back to your evolved form, do it now."

"Okay..." Flower says. "Okay! I'm doing it right away!"

"So, I don't mean to alarm anyone," I hear Melindra's voice from somewhere close to me, "but if I don't keep pulling these levers, the traps are going to get activated and kill us all."

"Is there no way for you to delay the traps?" Kate asks.

"Yes, there is, but I'm already doing that," Melindra says. "The most I can wait between two levers is five minutes. This means that if you're not done helping Barry within the next twenty minutes, we're going to need to get out of here and forget about the puzzle piece altogether."

"Why?" Kate says. "Can't we come back later?"

"We can, but the puzzle piece dispenser will not be activatable again for at least a month," Melindra says. "In other words, Flower, if you're planning to do something, do it fast."

 "Alright," Flower says. "I'm on it. I'm pretty sure that I can already sense Barry's sanctuary. Give me a few moments, and I'll teleport there!"

No more than five seconds later, I hear Flower speaking again, in a victorious tone.

"I did it!" she says, loudly. "I found it! I found Barry's sanctuary!"

"Good," Illuna says. "Now, are you seeing any unusual shades along the borders of the cube, or maybe towards the corners?"

"Umm... yes!" Flower says. "Yes, I think I see it! I'm burning it now!"

"Perfect," Illuna says. "Let us know when you're done, so that Barry can open his eyes again."

"Just a second... just a second... Okay, I'm done!" Flower says. "It's gone! The shade is gone!"

 "Can you check to see if there are any other shadows hiding on the surface of the cube?" I say. "If there was one of them, then there might be more."

"I don't think I saw any more of them, but I'll look closer, just to be sure," Flower says. "Give me a minute!"

She then remains silent for about twenty seconds, as she is carefully looking for the shades.

"Oh, I think I might have found another one..." Flower says. "Hold on, I'll get rid of this one too!"

"Can't you just burn the whole surface of the cube?" I ask her. "At least that way we'll be certain that you didn't miss anything."

"I don't know, can I?" Flower says. "Would anything bad happen if I did that?"

"Not that I'm aware of," Illuna says. "These sanctuaries should be designed to be very resistant to magic. Go ahead, cover it in flames."

"Roger that!" Flower says.

For the next ten seconds, I hear some loud noises, which I can only assume are the burning flames that Flower is using on my cube in the ethereal plane. Once the noises stop, Flower reports to us that she's finished her task.

"Okay, everything should be fine, now," Flower says. "Barry, you can open your eyes."

 "Finally," I say, as I open my eyes, like Flower instructed me. "Maybe now we can concentrate on what we came here to do instead of-- wait a minute, what's this?..."

"What's what?" Flower says. "What is wrong?"

"My perspective is shifting again but... this time it's different," I say. "Every time I blink, I can switch between the earthen and the ethereal plane. I can move my consciousness between the two planes at will. Is this something I should be worried about?"

"Well, is it still happening randomly, or do you have complete control over it?" Illuna says.

"No, it's not happening against my will," I say, as I blink a few more times to test how this works. "I can make the switch whenever I want. And... I think I can also make it so that I don't shift involuntarily between planes whenever I'm blinking. Yes... I think... I think I can turn it on and off just by concentrating on it. This is amazing! Why do you think it's happening?"

"Let me ask you this..." Illuna says. "How many times do you think you've been switching your consciousness between the two planes of existence in the past few minutes?"

"I don't know," I say. "It was happening more than a hundred times per second before I closed my eyes, so I guess I've been doing it thousands of times? Maybe tens of thousands?"

 "In that case, it's likely that you may have switched your consciousness between the two planes so many times that you've learned how to do it instinctively," Illuna says. "Enjoy your new-found ability."

"So... does this mean that I am an ethereal now?..." I ask her, confused.

"Being able to change your consciousness between planes is not something unique to ethereals," Illuna says. "I can do it, Arraka can do it, and the same goes for any spirit from the magical plane, but just because we can change our perspective does not mean that our main focus is on the ethereal plane. In Flower's case, she considers her real self to be the soul from her mind, and she views her body from the earthen plane as a puppet on strings. Is this how you are feeling about your body right now?"

"Hmm..." I say. "Now that you mention it, no, that is not how I'm feeling. I did feel sort of like that when the Overseer was the one who sent my consciousness to the ethereal plane by force, but not anymore. My body from the earthen plane is clearly my main perspective, and the soul feels like the one that I'm controlling through strings, instead."

"Then you are not an ethereal," Illuna says.

"Yeah, I guess not," I say.

"This is all very lovely," Melindra says, "but could we perhaps focus on our original task? I can't delay these traps for much longer, so I suggest you either get the puzzle piece now, or we get the hell out of here!"

"Yes, yes, I'm ready," Flower says. "Where did I need to stand again?"

"Right over there by the--" Melindra starts to say, but then all of the torches from the corridor get extinguished at the same time.

"Argh!" Melindra says. "Damn these old torches! I should have known that they wouldn't last for long!"

"It's okay," Flower says. "I can just make a few floating orbs of fire again to light the corridor. It's not a big problem!"

"Alright, so as I was saying," Melindra continues, while Flower is positioning her balls of fire around the room to provide us with optimal lighting, "in order to get the puzzle piece, you need to stand next to the wall on that side. Meanwhile, I'm going to be pulling on that lever over there. Once I pull the lever, the wall in front of you will open up, and then you'll be able to get the puzzle piece from the dispenser by-- my gods, what has gotten into Arraka? She just won't shut up!"

"Just ignore her," Illuna says, as Arraka can be heard mumbling furiously from the closed amulet. "She's probably cursing at us again."

"But she hasn't said anything for more than half an hour," Kate says. "What if it's something important? Can you open the amulet just for a moment, please? I'd like to hear what she has to say."

 "Fine," Illuna says, as she reaches for her amulet so she can open it. "Prepare to cover your ears."

"You are being duped, you imbeciles!!!" Arraka shouts, as her voice echoes all throughout the ruins. "The illusionist royal guard has been hiding here invisibly this whole time! He's the one who extinguished the torches, and he made an illusion that messes with your sense of direction while the lights were out! Look at the walls! You are seeing them in reverse!"

"This doesn't make any sense," Illuna says. "How would the illusionist even know we're here?"

"No, I think she's right," Melindra says. "The two walls and the lever placements are almost completely symmetrical, so it's very hard to see the difference, but now that I'm taking a better look, I think I can--"

"Shut up and get away from the walls!" Arraka shouts. "The illusionist is about to pull a lever!"

"Ah, crap," Melindra says. "Everyone come here! Over here where I'm standing! It's the only safe place. Quick!"

As we are all rushing to Melindra's position, multiple arrows begin flying from the walls, while several spinning blades are coming out of the floor, moving back and forth through the corridor. Once we all reach Melindra, Kate makes four walls of ice around us, so that they can defend us from any stray arrows that could wind up hitting us.

"Where is the illusionist?" Kate asks. "Is he still in the ruins with us?"

 "No, he's gone," Arraka says. "He's running up the stairs as we speak."

"Running up the stairs?" Melindra says, as she almost lets out a laugh. "Well, I guess we won't be seeing him anymore, then."

"What do you mean?" I say.

Right after I ask my question, I hear a man screaming in pain, as the whole staircase and the entrance to the ruins get filled with flames.

"The exit was obviously going to be booby trapped too," Melindra says. "I don't know what that guy was thinking."

"Do you think he's dead?..." Flower asks, somewhat apprehensively.

"Of course he's dead," Melindra says, "After a fire like that, I don't even think there will be any remains left of him, except for his ashes."

"So, how long do we need to keep standing here?" Kate asks. "Will these traps ever stop?"

"Yeah, I got it!" Flower says, as she is now heading to the spot that Melindra showed her.

"I will be pulling the lever on 'three', okay?" Melindra shouts, from the other side of the corridor. "One, two, three!"

 Almost immediately after she pulls the lever, multiple arrows get shot out of the walls, forcing Flower to use her acrobatic moves in order to dodge them. Meanwhile, Kate has conjured two floating shields of ice that are defending us against the incoming projectiles, but now there are also some spinning metal blades that are coming out of the floor and heading in our direction at a fast speed.

"Everyone come here!" Melindra shouts, from the other side of the corridor. "Over here where I'm standing! It's the only safe place. Quick!"

We all make our way towards Melindra as fast as we can, while Kate tries her best to protect us from the arrows with her ice, and then once we reach the safe spot, Kate makes four walls of ice around us, so that they can defend us from any stray arrows that could wind up hitting us.

"What happened?" Flower asks. "I don't understand!"

"I'll tell you what happened!" Melindra says. "The walls were reversed! I only noticed it after I pulled the damn lever. Somebody must have cast an illusion on us or something, while the lights were off. Barry, didn't you say that one of the royal guards who were still alive was an illusionist?"

"Yeah, and he also liked to hide around invisibly a lot," I say. "He was almost completely undetectable."

"Why not?" she asks me.

"Are you not noticing anything out of the ordinary with the walls?" I say.

"Not really, no," Melindra says.

"Look, that stone with the scratch on it was on the opposite side," I say. "And the lever that's a little shorter than the others was on the left wall, not the right one. There's also a little crack there, between those two stones which I am quite certain was supposed to be on the other wall as well. Do I really need to go on?"

"Hey, I think you might be on to something, here," Melindra says. "I didn't really notice the difference before, because the two walls and the lever placements are almost completely symmetrical, but now that you mention it, there really are quite a few discrepancies... Barry, didn't you say earlier that there was an illusionist royal guard who was still alive?"

"Yeah, it's the one who was always invisible and completely undetectable," I say.

"Did you just say invisible?!" Melindra says, while a lever somewhere further down the corridor appears to be pulling itself down.

"Ah, crap," Melindra says. "Everyone come here! Over here where I'm standing! It's the only safe place. Quick!"

 As we are all rushing to Melindra's position, multiple arrows begin flying from the walls, while several spinning blades are coming out of the floor, moving back and forth through the corridor.

And then when we realized that it was a trick, he panicked, and he pulled a random lever to activate the traps. Who knows where he is now? I bet he's laughing at us.

 "I will be pulling the lever on 'three', okay?" Melindra shouts, from the other side of the corridor. "One, two, three!"

Almost immediately after she pulls the lever, several arrows fly from the walls straight for me and Flower. I dodge the arrows at the very last second, and then I am forced to step away from the wall, because there are several spinning blades coming out of the floor, moving back and forth through the corridor.

As I keep dodging arrows and blades left and right, Flower is also using her fancy acrobatic moves to move away unscathed, while Kate is making walls of ice to defend herself from the incoming projectiles.

"Everyone come here!" Melindra shouts, from the other side of the corridor. "Over here where I'm standing! It's the only safe place. Quick!"

We all make our way towards Melindra as fast as we can, while Kate tries her best to protect us from the arrows with her ice, and then once we reach the safe spot, Kate makes four walls of ice around us, so that they can defend us from any stray arrows that could wind up hitting us.

"What happened?" Flower asks. "I don't understand!"

"I'll tell you what happened!" Melindra says. "The walls were reversed! I only noticed it after I pulled the damn lever. Somebody must have cast an illusion on us or something, while the lights were off. Barry, didn't you say that one of the royal guards who were still alive was an illusionist?"

 "Yeah, and he also liked to hide around invisibly a lot," I say. "He was almost completely undetectable."

"Well, if I get my hands on him," Melindra says, "I'm going to wring his neck as if he were a--"

Suddenly, we hear a man screaming in pain from the direction of the stairs, as the whole staircase and the entrance to the ruins get filled with flames.

"Oh, never mind," Melindra says. "I forgot about the traps on the stairs. Well, I guess he won't be bothering us anymore."

"Do you think he's dead?..." Flower asks, somewhat apprehensively.

"Of course he's dead," Melindra says, "After a fire like that, I don't even think there will be any remains left of him, except for his ashes."

"So, how long do we need to keep standing here?" Kate asks. "Will these traps ever stop?"

"You're saying we can still get the puzzle piece even under these conditions?" Kate says.

"Yes, but we need to hurry," Melindra says. "Look, the traps have stopped, for now. Take down the ice walls, and we can get to work."

"Are you sure?" Kate asks.

"Of course I'm sure!" Melindra says. "Now take them down quick, before the timer runs out."

"If you say so," Kate tells her, and then she dismisses her walls of ice.

"I'm pulling the lever," Melindra says. "It's now or nothing. If you want the puzzle piece, make a run for it!"

"Okay, got it!" Flower says, as she rushes towards the wall where she was standing before, and so do I.

As soon as Melindra pulls the lever, a big stone in the wall slides away, revealing an old-looking device, with a single button on top of it. When Flower reaches it, she pushes it immediately and a puzzle piece is thrown into her hand.

"You first," Illuna says.

"Fine, but hurry!" Melindra says. "We don't have much time."

We all follow Melindra up the stairs, climbing as quickly as humanly possible, and once we reach the top, we close the hidden trapdoor behind us. Then, just as we rush out of the house, we hear an explosion below the abandoned building, as the traps seem to be reactivating themselves again.

"Hah!" Melindra says. "We made it! And we got the puzzle piece too! I told you we could do it!"

"That was much too close..." Illuna says. "One small mistake, and we could have all died."

"Hey, that wasn't my fault!" Melindra says. "I had no way of knowing that the illusionist would be there. How did he even find us, anyway?"

"That is an interesting question," Illuna says, as she now opens the amulet around her neck. "Would you care to answer it, Arraka?"

 "Sure," Arraka says. "The illusionist happened to see you when you were flying above the city, so he hopped into a flying metal vehicle, used his illusion magic to make it silent and invisible along with himself, and then he used it to follow you all the way to the abandoned building."

"So, you knew that he was following us from the very beginning?" Illuna says.

"Mhm..." Arraka says. "And I might have even considered telling you about him, if SOMEONE hadn't spinned my amulet again."

"Alright, you've made your point," Illuna says. "I'm leaving your amulet open for now. But if you don't help us next time, you know what will happen."

"Whatever," Arraka says.

"Flower, I think it's about time you turn back to normal," Illuna says. "There shouldn't be any more need for you to perform long-range teleportation in the ether for today."

"Well, okay, but it's going to be just a really quick look, and then I'll go back," Flower says.

"Flower, I think this might not be a good idea--" Illuna starts to say, but Flower interrupts her.

"Barry, I'm here!" Flower tells me on the earthen plane.

"You mean, you're inside my mind right now?" I say. "Hold on, let me switch."

I then concentrate on the idea of the ethereal plane, I blink my eyes, and my perspective instantly switches to that of my soul.

"Wow, your place is really barren," Flower says to me in the ethereal plane, as she takes a look around the inside of my cube. "Have you never thought of getting a table or something? Or at least a bed."

"Yes, I'll create one of those as soon as I figure out how to do it," I tell her.

 "Oh, it's easy!" Flower says. "Remind me to teach you about it later. Anyway, it doesn't look like there are any shades in here, Barry. You should be safe. So... I guess I'll be going back to my own mind now. See you, Barry!"

"Yeah, see you," I say, and then Flower teleports away.

I then blink, in order to switch my consciousness back to the earthen plane, and I turn off my ability to move between planes temporarily, so that I no longer do it every time I blink. I think I'm going to have to experiment with this power some more, to see if I can make it a little more convenient.

"Ugh... I'm feeling a little... tired," Flower says, after she turns back to her normal form, without the shiny eyes.

"I tried to warn you," Illuna says. "Teleporting into other people's minds can be very draining. You should consider yourself lucky that a small headache is all you got out of this."

"Oh..." I say. "Sorry about that. I didn't know."

"I... think I'm going to lie down and get some rest," Flower says. "Petal, is it fine if I let you control the body for a while?"

 "Yes, it's fine," Illuna says.

"Okay, see you guys later," Flower tells us, and then her eyes turn blue again.

"So, is everyone ready to leave?" Melindra says.

"Yes, but I'll need someone to carry me while we're flying," Illuna says. "I can't fly without Flower's fire jets."

"I'll carry you," Kate says. "You should be light enough that it won't pose a problem for my flying ice platform."

"Thank you," Illuna says.

"Are you feeling alright?" Illuna says. "You're not tired from the extra effort?"

"No, I'm okay!" Flower says.

"That's good," Illuna says. "Shall we go back, then? I think we're finished here."

 Just when we were about to head back to our sleeping quarters, we saw Alice, the little girl who asked us to save her family when we first came to the underground caverns, and she was hugging a woman, who appeared to be her mother. Meanwhile, Albert was telling her that her brother and father had been rescued as well, but that they needed some time to recover after what they had been through, and that they were currently resting in the medical wing of the rebels' base.

"Hey, look!" Hadrik tells us, as we're watching Alice and Albert from a distance. "It's the little girl that we met on the first day! I guess they must have found her family!"

"Yeah, I hope her father's okay," I say. "He didn't look all that well when we saw him in the seredium tower."

"Don't worry," Daren says. "The white mages from this place are very good at what they do. I'm sure they'll get him back on his feet in no time."

When the girl asked about her brother and father, Albert took a while to give her a straight answer, but eventually he had to admit that even though her brother was rescued, her father was already dead when they found him in the seredium tower.

All of a sudden, I remember her father's face when he died before my eyes after I cut his chains, and I get a sudden urge to throw up.

"Let's go to our quarters, Barry," Daren says, as he puts a hand on my back, after seeing my reaction. "I don't think this is something that you need to hear right now."

As we are heading to our rooms, I can hear the little girl's cries echoing throughout the caverns, and they do not stop until we are too far from her to be able to hear her voice anymore.

When we reach our sleeping room, we all sit down in a circle and begin to talk about what we are going to do until tomorrow morning.

 Since this was the last day in which we could see Leila before our departure, we had a bit of trouble deciding how we'd divide our remaining time with her, but after discussing things between ourselves, everyone agreed that me and Kate should get to spend the most time with Leila, since we were the ones who got along with her the best.

The arrangement that we came up with was that Daren, Hadrik, Melindra, Flower and Illuna would have access to Leila until the end of the evening, and then Kate and I would each take one night shift with her, so that we could have enough time to properly say goodbye. This would of course mean that Leila would not be able to get any sleep for the night, but she said she didn't have any problem with that, since she didn't have anywhere to go tomorrow, so she could just get some sleep after we leave.

While Daren and the others were busy talking with Leila and rememorating our moments together, I figured that this would be a good opportunity for me to practice my ethereal plane shifting, since I probably wouldn't be getting much of a chance to do it while we'd be on the road tomorrow.

 Finding an inn that was still doing business despite the recent lockdown proved to be a little harder than anticipated, but after an hour or two of searching, we did manage to come across one that was open.

 It took me more than an hour, but I eventually found a way to be aware of both planes at the same time, even if one of them would only be there in the back of my mind, as if it were somewhere in my peripheral vision. 

This way, I would not need to be worried about my body being attacked in the earthen plane while my soul would be busy exploring the ethereal plane. It would also be a guarantee that if any of my friends had anything to say to me while I was in the ethereal plane, I could hear them talking and switch back. One other thing I achieved by training myself was to no longer handle the shift between planes by blinking my eyes, and rather to do it simply by focusing my consciousness on one plane or the other.

As soon as I got this whole system in place, I asked Flower if she felt well-rested enough to teleport outside my sanctuary for a little, in order to help me practice some of my spells, but Illuna said that it would be too dangerous for her to transform again so soon after everything she's already done today, and that we should leave it for tomorrow, after she'd get a good night's sleep. 

 Who knows when we'll see each other again after this? What if something goes terribly wrong during the tournament and I never manage to come back to her? What if I say something really stupid to her today, and that will be her very last memory of me?

As these thoughts keep racing through my head, I am finding it more and more difficult to concentrate on what I am saying. Eventually, after only a few minutes of conversation, the two of us stop talking completely, and there is a very awkward silence that has not even once before happened between me and her, even though she is mute.

After changing out of my pajamas and grabbing my backpack, I walk out of our room and I find Leila sitting on the floor with her back against one of the cavern walls, just far enough from our quarters to not wake the others up by talking, while still being able to observe the entrance.

Once I reach Leila, I seat myself next to her and we begin to talk, but from the very first moments, I notice that something is wrong. Our conversation does not flow as naturally as it usually does. I think it's because we both know that this will be the last conversation we will have in a very long while, and we're both feeling a lot of pressure because of it.

"Make sure to savor it!" I say. "I have very few of these left!"

"I know," Leila writes, with a smile, as she continues to take very small bites of the biscuit until she finally eats it all.

Once she is done eating, I suddenly realize that this has not helped to move our conversation forward at all. We are still just sitting around awkwardly, without either of us being able to come up with anything to talk about.

After more than ten seconds of silence, I decide that I simply can't take it anymore, and I blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind.

"So..." I say. "Has your stat device been getting any points lately? I think I haven't gotten even a single point since we arrived in Ollendor."

"Umm... no," Leila writes. "Now that you mention it, I don't think I've been getting any points either."

 "Here's a crazy idea..." I say. "What if the reason why we're having so much trouble harnessing energy with our devices in the cities is because there are hundreds of other devices gathered in these places, and the energy is getting divided equally between them?"

"I don't think so," Leila writes. "If there were so many people with devices walking around these cities, I would have detected at least one of them. My stat booster alerts me when there are other stat devices around me, remember?"

"Yeah, but what if it's not multiple people who are walking around with these devices?" I say. "What if someone deliberately gathered a large number of devices and put them in these cities to harness energy from the participants? There would be fewer chances for you to detect them if these stat boosters were all lying in a building somewhere, right?"

"I suppose..." Leila writes.

"There's also something else that's bothering me," I say. "When we first met Melindra, she told me that she couldn't find any stat boosters for sale on the other continents, no matter how hard she looked, even though these devices used to be extremely easy to find in shops before. What if the real reason why so many of these merchants didn't have the fortune teller trinket in stock anymore was because somebody needed to buy all of the devices before the tournament, so that they could--"

"Barry..." Leila interrupts me, as I now notice that she is looking directly into my eyes. "What are we doing?..."

 "I'm... not sure if I really understand the question--" I say, but then Leila cuts me off again, with another one of her floating texts.

"This may be the last night shift we'll have together in a very long time, and we're sitting here, talking about our stat devices..." Leila writes.

"Well... what else do you want to talk about?" I ask her.

"Anything..." Leila writes. "Anything, as long as it doesn't feel as forced and as awkward as the conversations we've been having in the past few minutes. Barry, what happened to us? We used to be able to talk freely, about any subject that came to our minds, and there was never any tension between us. Why can't we just act as if this were any other day? I mean, it's not like we're never going to see each other again! We're just taking a little break, aren't we?"

"You're right..." I say, as I am slowly processing Leila's words in my head. "You're absolutely right! I don't know what I was getting so worked up about! We're practically only taking a short trip of a few weeks or maybe a month, and then we'll be back. People wouldn't normally be so tense just because they won't see each other for a few weeks, right?"

"Exactly!" Leila writes. "So, let's just forget all about it and talk normally, like we always do."

 "Alright, you've convinced me!" I say. "So, what do you figure should be our next topic of conversation?"

"It doesn't matter," Leila writes, with a smile. "But whatever it is, I am planning to enjoy every moment of it!"

She then takes my hand and she holds it gently, as we begin to reminisce about our first days together in Thilias, and soon we forget all about the stress we had before, continuing to talk naturally about everything and anything that would come to our minds, just like we always did.

The rest of the hours passed us by very quickly, but we made very sure during this time that not a single moment was wasted. No matter what happens in the future, we will always be able to look back on this day and remember it with a smile on our faces. Of that, I am certain.

"Have you thought about what you're going to do after we leave?" I ask Leila. "Will you be staying with the rebels in the underground, or will you move somewhere else?"

 Once again, there is a pause, but this time it doesn't feel unnatural. We both know that our night shift is almost at its end, but we've already accepted it. We have no regrets.

"Barry, before we end our night shift... there's just... one last thing that I wanted to talk to you about," Leila writes, looking slightly embarrassed. "The other night, when you promised me that we'd go on adventures together and I... kissed you all of a sudden... I know that it might not have been the appropriate thing to do in that situation, but I was just so happy, and I kind of just... did it without thinking. I really hope I didn't put you in a difficult position by doing something like that completely out of the blue..."

 "I'll probably stay with the rebels for a while," Leila writes, "but the king of the underground did mention that they're planning to relocate to the surface soon, so my father and I will most likely just rent a house somewhere inside the city later and make it our new home."

"So, you'll finally be living with your father in the same house again, huh?" I ask her.

"Yep," Leila writes. "That's the plan!"

 "I can't go back to the underground base now," Leila writes. "It would be too risky. I've already spoken to my father yesterday about our alliance with the Overseer, and he agreed that it would be best if we both moved somewhere on the surface, after the end of the conflict. We have a meeting spot where we will be seeing each other later in the evening."

"Are you sure they'll let him leave the caverns?" I say.

"They'll let him," Leila writes. "I have no doubts about that. Even if they suspect him to be a traitor, they simply owe him too much to not at least allow him to leave their base safely. But I don't think they should have any reasons to suspect him. As far as they know, we've all been captured by the Overseer together with the rebel fighters, so it would be perfectly normal that my father would want to go to the surface to look for me."

"Yes, I suppose that's true," I say.

 "Leila, it's fine," I say. "You didn't do anything inappropriate. There's no need for you to apologize."

"I'm glad you feel that way," Leila writes, with a smile.

She then pauses for a few seconds, while her face is slowly beginning to blush.

"Would it be too out of the blue if I kissed you again now?" Leila writes.

"Not at all," I answer her.

"Okay," Leila writes, while smiling. "Don't say I didn't warn you!"

 She then leans over to me and gives me a kiss on the lips, which lasts for several seconds.

"I'll miss you, Barry..." Leila writes, after the kiss is over.

"I know," I say. "I'll miss you too."

"Come on, it's almost morning," Leila writes. "We should go wake the others."

With these last words, we both get up from the ground, we head back to our room, and we do not say anything else to each other until we wake all of our friends up.

"I... think it's time to go wake up the others," Leila writes, as she is getting up from the ground, and then I do the same.

After taking a few steps forward, Leila turns her head back to me one more time, as some new floating letters are forming themselves in front of me.

 "I'll miss you, Barry..." Leila writes.

"I know," I say. "I'll miss you too."

 Instead of answering Leila, I lean over and give her a quick kiss on the lips.

"It's okay," I tell her, as Leila is looking at me confused. "Now we're even."

"Now we're even!" Leila writes, with a smile, once she understands what I meant.

After a few seconds of silence, Leila gets up from the ground, while one of her blue floating texts appears before my eyes.

"I... think it's time to go wake up the others," Leila writes. "It's almost morning."

 "Right," I say, as I get up as well. "Let's go."

After taking a few steps forward, Leila turns her head back to me one more time, as some new floating letters are forming themselves in front of me.

 As soon as everyone was up on their feet, we left for the teleporter room, saying one last goodbye to the rebels when we passed through the waiting room, and then once we reached the teleporter, we told the engineer who was operating the control panel to stand by, while we each said goodbye to Leila, one by one.

Even though we were originally planning to keep it short, each one of us ended up spending well over a minute with Leila, as if we simply didn't want to let go. Daren even gifted Leila one of his transceivers, instructing her to give it to doctor Reidzek, so that we could at least contact her through her father from time to time, in order to know that she was safe.

By the time that Kate's turn finally came to say her goodbye, she could no longer control herself and she burst into tears, as she hugged Leila very tightly in her arms.

"Leila, I'm going to miss you so much," Kate says, while trying in vain to stop the tears from flowing down her face. "I promise that I'll come back to you. I promise! And I'll bring Diane back too, and Barry, and everyone else, and then we're all going to--"

 "Do you really think Selkram is the kind of person who would let something as trivial as that stop him from getting what he wants?" Arraka says. "If the mute girl will not be there when the trial is about to begin, then he will BRING her there. If Eiden can sense someone from all across the continent and teleport them to him, then so can the 'God of Time'. I guarantee you that Selkram NEVER lets anyone escape his trials, no matter where they might be. In other words, you should be meeting your precious Leila again within the next ten days, at most. Now can you PLEASE stop your whining? I'm trying to concentrate on something, here!"

"Well..." Kate tells Leila, as she is wiping the last tears from her face. "In that case, I guess I'll... see you later, then?"

"See you later," Leila writes with a smile, and then we give the engineer the signal to teleport us out, while waving goodbye to Leila one last time.

 "What is WRONG with you people?!" Arraka shouts all of a sudden from her amulet. "You're all going to be seeing each other again in one week, but you're whining and crying like children! Is there really no limit to your stupidity?!"

"How do you know it's going to be only one week?" Daren asks her. "At the moment, we have no idea when the tournament will end. It could be well over a month before--"

"I'm not talking about the end of the tournament, you cretin!" Arraka says. "I'm talking about Selkram's ritual! Did you already forget that he had to interrupt the second trial and that he said we will continue it next time?! We're all going to be taking that trial again together, whether you like it or not!"

"Yeah, but Leila will no longer be travelling with us at that time," Hadrik says. "How is he going to get her into the trial if she won't even be there with us anymore?"
