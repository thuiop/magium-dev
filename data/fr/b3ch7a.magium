The whole world is spinning, and I'm having one hell of a headache. This has got to be the worst hangover I've ever had in my life. What did I even drink yesterday to bring me in this state?

I can't remember. And if I so much as try to focus on remembering anything that happened before I went to sleep, it starts feeling like a hundred small daggers are moving through my brain. I need to go back to sleep. I'm sure everything will be better once I get more rest.

That's right. I need to sleep. Just gonna keep my eyes closed and put my head on the pillow. Do I even have a pillow? Where was it that I fell asleep again? It doesn't matter. All I have to do is go to bed, and I'll figure everything out afterwards.

 Something's not right. I can't lie down for some reason. It feels like my upper body is being held into an upright position by an unknown force that won't let go. Now this force is shaking me violently. It wants me to wake up, but I won't lose to it. My eyes are staying closed.

The force is still shaking me. It just doesn't know when to give up. Can't it see that I'm trying to sleep, here? Talk about being rude. Maybe I should give this mysterious force a piece of my mind. If I tell it off, it might go away and leave me alone. I just need to choose the right words, to make sure that it will stop bothering me for good.

 "Give me a few more minutes," I tell the mysterious force. "My head still hurts. I need to lie down and rest."

The shaking has stopped. The force is now gently placing my upper body back on the ground, so I can go to sleep.

It worked! My words convinced the force to leave me alone! At long last, it's time for some well-deserved rest.

I fall asleep almost instantly, but after what couldn't have been more than three minutes, the force pulls me up again and it begins to lightly tap the right side of my face. Seeing that this doesn't wake me up, the force decides to pull my eyes open by itself, until I finally decide to open them of my own free will.

"Just a few more minutes," I start to say. "Just a few more minutes and I'll be--"

When I open my eyes completely, I am shocked to see Leila in front of me, who is currently holding my eyes open with her fingers, and who is now making a bright blue text float in front of me.

"I'm sorry, Barry, but I can't let you rest any more than this," the writing says. "The royal guards could be on our tail any minute. We need to move."

As I am reading Leila's text, everything that happened before I fainted suddenly comes back to me.

 This was never about me having a hangover. We were teleported here by mistake, and I lost my consciousness due to the headache that I got from the failed teleportation. And Leila's father... he was kidnapped! She's right, we have no time to lose! We need to find our way out of this cave as quickly as possible.

I get up from the ground and I begin to look around me, trying to figure out which way we need to go. As I am moving my head, the strong feeling of nausea from before returns to me in full-force, making me lose my balance while simply standing in place. Leila catches me before I fall to the ground and then she goes to my right side, taking my arm and putting it around her neck so that I can hold onto her in case I feel like I'm about to fall again.

 "Go away," I tell the mysterious force. "Stop bothering me! I'm trying to sleep!"

The force has now stopped shaking me, and it is instead lightly tapping the right side of my face. Seeing that this doesn't wake me up, the force decides to pull my eyes open by itself, until I finally decide to open them of my own free will.

"Didn't you hear me?" I say. "I told you to go away! What does a man have to do to get some sleep around here--"

When I open my eyes completely, I am shocked to see Leila in front of me, who is currently holding my eyes open with her fingers, and who is now making a bright blue text float in front of me.

"Barry, do you recognize me?" Leila writes, with a slightly worried look on her face. "Can you tell who I am?"

"Yes..." I say. "Yes, sorry about that, I was just--"

As I am trying to find my words, everything that happened before I fainted suddenly comes back to me.

 This was never about me having a hangover. We were teleported here by mistake, and I lost my consciousness due to the headache that I got from the failed teleportation. And Leila's father... he was kidnapped! We can't afford to waste any more time standing here. We need to move!

 "Go away!" I tell the mysterious force. "Your face is ugly and nobody likes you!"

The force has now stopped shaking me, but what it is doing instead is to pull my face from both sides, by the cheeks, making it feel as if my mouth is going to get split in half.

"Hey, cut it out!" I say, as I struggle to pronounce the words correctly while my mouth is being stretched wide. "Just because you're ugly, it doesn't mean that you have to take it out on me for telling you the--"

I stop talking all of a sudden, because as soon as I open my eyes I realize that the person in front of me was none other than Leila, who was currently frowning at me while holding my cheeks with both her hands.

"Oh..." I tell her, as I slowly figure out what's going on.

"Are you awake now, or should I keep pulling on these for a while longer, for good measure?" Leila writes, as she raises an eyebrow.

"No, I'm uh... I'm awake..." I say, as Leila releases me. "Ahem... Sorry about what I said earlier. I was still a little confused, and--"

 As I am trying to find my words, everything that happened before I fainted suddenly comes back to me.

 "You shouldn't be making any sudden movements," Leila writes. "That will only make your headache worse. Try moving your head slowly, until you get accustomed to your nauseating sensation."

"Damn, this is so much worse than the last time when we ended up here," I say, as I struggle to not faint again from the pain. "My head hurts so much it feels like it's going to explode..."

"Yeah," Leila writes. "The headache is a lot stronger now than it was before. With how badly this teleportation went, I'm surprised that we're even alive. The teleporting device must have had some sort of failsafe mechanism implemented so that people's lives wouldn't be put at risk in case of a serious malfunction."

"Wait a minute..." I say. "Are you by any chance getting the same headache as me right now?"

"If you're talking about the feeling of small daggers moving through my brain, then yes," Leila writes.

"Well, you sure are handling this a lot better than I am, then," I say. "At the moment, I'm having a difficult time even holding this conversation with you without collapsing."

 "Don't get me wrong," Leila writes, "the pain in my head is excruciating, but it's nothing compared to what we used to experience on a daily basis at the Beacon of Hope. I guess that when you grow up in an environment like that, you get to build up a bit of tolerance to pain and nausea without realizing it. Come on, let's see if we can get you to take a few steps forward. I'm sure you'll feel better once you make a little progress."

I take her advice and I try to move away from my initial location, placing one foot in front of the other while still holding onto Leila to maintain my balance. After no more than ten seconds I ask Leila to put me back down, because I was beginning to feel like I was on the verge of fainting again.

"This isn't working," I tell Leila, while I'm still resting on the ground, with my back against a wall. "I think you might have to go ahead without me. At this rate, I'm only going to slow you down, and you need to find your father as quickly as possible. Just leave me here, and I'll catch up with you later, I promise!"

"Don't be stupid..." Leila writes. "I'm not leaving you behind. If any of the royal guards teleport themselves here and find you in this state, they will kill you in a heartbeat. Give me a moment. I'll try to see if I can remember a technique that I learned from my father a while back. He used to do this for me sometimes, when the other lessathi from the Beacon weren't looking, and it got rid of some of the pain from my head. I think it worked like this."

 Leila now kneels next to me and she begins to lightly massage both my temples with her hands. As she is doing this, I can feel the aura around my head changing its flow and becoming calmer and calmer with each passing moment. Once she is finally done with her technique, the pain in my head gets greatly reduced and even though a strong feeling of nausea still remains, it has become much more bearable.

"That was incredible!" I tell Leila, as she is now getting back up. "It felt almost like you were using magic. Or at least an aura manipulation technique, like the captain of the guards!"

"Even if I can't cast spells," Leila writes, "I'm still pretty good at sensing the flow of auras, so as long as I can find the right pressure points, I can eventually figure out what I need to do."

She then offers me her hand, and she helps me get back on my feet.

"How are you feeling?" Leila writes. "Do you think you can walk?"

"Yeah," I tell her. "I'm still feeling nauseous, but it's nothing compared to how I was before. But what about you? Is the pain in your head still there? Have you tried using this technique on yourself to see if it works?"

"I've tried it in the past, but it only seems to work if you're using it on someone else," Leila writes. "The pain is still there, but... I can manage. Anyway, let's see if we can trace back our steps from yesterday. I think we need to go this way first. Are you coming?"

"Before we go, could you try teaching me that massage technique?" I say. "Maybe I can help you get rid of your headache."

"Barry, that's not-- it's not that simple..." Leila writes. "It would take too much time to explain it to you!"

"Then just give me the really short version, and I'll see if I can figure it out on my own," I say. "If not, we can leave."

"Fine," Leila writes. "But it's going to be a VERY short explanation. Come here."

I get closer to Leila and I put both my hands on her temples, as she tells me through her writing exactly which kinds of aura fluctuations I need to look out for.

 "Okay, let's move," I say, and then I follow Leila further into the cave.

 "So... what do you think happened to everyone at the rebel base?" Leila writes to me, while we are walking through the tunnels. "You don't suppose any of them got buried under the rubble from all those explosions, do you?..."

"I don't know about the rebels or the civilians, but everyone in our group has been through far worse stuff than some lousy cave-ins," I say. "I wouldn't worry about them being buried under the rubble, but then again, those explosions are probably the least of their worries right now. If what Peter said was true, the king of Ollendor has sent a small army to attack the people in the underground, and what's left of the royal guards will be there too, including the trainees. It's going to be a tough fight for them, any way you look at it."

"Can you try calling them through the transceiver?" Leila writes. "Maybe we'll get lucky and you'll be able to reach them."

"The walls around us are all filled with seredium, so I wouldn't get my hopes up but I can try, sure," I say.

I then pull out my transceiver, set the frequency to Daren's number and tap it once.

 After about half a minute of me moving my hands around the sides of her head, trying in vain to find the subtle changes in the aura flow that Leila is telling me about, I eventually realize that I'm not making any noticeable progress, so I decide to give up.

"You were right," I tell Leila, as I take my hands away from her head. "It's not working. We should probably leave."

"Okay, let’s get going," Leila writes, and then the two of us travel further into the cave.

}
#if(v_magical_sense >= 2 && v_b3_ch7_massage != 0) {
 After about twenty seconds or so, I begin to finally understand how my hand movements are influencing the very subtle changes in Leila's aura, and this helps me to better identify the source of her headache. Despite Leila's rushed and incomplete instructions, I manage to improvise a technique that is close enough to what she used on me, and I can see how the strained expression that she had on her face slowly turns into one that is much more relaxed.

"The pain... it's going away!" Leila writes, astonished, as I am still massaging her temples. "I didn't think you could learn to do this so quickly! It took me hours of practice to get this good with it when my father first taught the technique to me."

"It's probably easier for me because of my enhanced magical sense," I say. "As long as you can properly notice each minor change in the aura, it's easier to make improvisations to the technique. Tell me when the pain is fully gone, so I'll know when to stop."

"I think I'm fine, now," Leila writes. "There is still some nausea left, like in your case, but that can't be solved with a massage. We'll have to wait for it to pass on its own. Let's get going."

"Alright," I say, as I take my hands away from Leila's head. "Follow me. I'm pretty sure I remember which way we went last time."

 "Daren, are you there?" I say loudly. "Hey, Daren!"

As expected, I get no answer.

"It's no use," I say, as I close my transceiver and put it back in my pocket. "We won't know what happened to them until we get out of here."

"And by out of here, do you mean inside that tower with all the people chained up in the basement?" Leila writes, looking a little worried.

"Well, it's not like we know any other way out of these caves," I say. "We might end up trapped here for days if we try to find another exit on our own."

"Last time, we were able to get away from there because we had someone to teleport us out..." Leila writes. "This time, the rebels' teleporting engineer is no longer on our side, which means that the only way out of that tower will be through their heavily-guarded front door."

"I know," I tell Leila. "But like I said, we don't exactly have much of a choice. We're also probably going to need to get inside that tower anyway if we want to save your father, so we might as well do it now, while we still have the element of surprise."

 "My father?!" Leila writes. "What do you mean? Why would he be in there?"

"Well," I say, "we know that the king wants his help with controlling the Overseer, and from what we saw during our previous visit, it looked like that particular tower was where Billy Bob had set up his main base of operations. If the king really wants your father to become a replacement for Bilibolbrathatastran or whatever his name was, then there is a good chance that the first place he'd want to take him to is the lessathi's work office."

"That's certainly possible, but it's also just as possible that they're simply keeping him in a prison cell until he agrees to cooperate with them," Leila writes. "There's no way to know for sure."

 "I'm sure the guards from the tower will tell us all we need to know if we ask them nicely," I say. "Provided they know the answers, of course."

"What I'm more interested to know right now is which way are we supposed to go next?" Leila writes. "Left or right? All these tunnels look completely identical... I'm having a really hard time remembering which of these corridors we went through yesterday."

"I think we went through here," I tell Leila, as I point towards one of the tunnels. "We'll know it's the right way if we won't sense any magical traps ahead of us. Normally, the traps that we ran into before should still be disarmed."

"Unless someone placed some new traps while we were away..." Leila writes.

"In just one night?" I say. "I doubt it. There weren't even any guards patrolling these corridors, so the king and his men clearly didn't know about their existence. As long as they don't send any of the royal guards to intercept us, our trip towards the tower should be a breeze. Come on, let's keep going. I think I recognize this next section."

 We keep walking through the underground tunnels for some time, trying to find our way around by searching for familiar-looking rocks on the ground and in the walls. Luckily for us, Flower and Melindra made me take an extensive training course in recognizing distinctive features for all types of stones during our last night shift, and this makes it a lot easier for me to tell the difference between these nearly identical corridors. It also helps that the blue crystals embedded in the walls are very bright, so there is no need for us to take out our stat devices to light our paths.

"So... why do you suppose we were teleported here, of all places?" Leila writes, as the two of us are examining the walls in order to confirm that we are still on the right path. "Do you think there's any chance that the Barry from the teleporter room was secretly still on our side and wanted to help us escape?"

"No, I don't think that's what happened," I say. "My guess is that this cave is the default place where the teleporting device sends you if the teleportation goes horribly wrong. Like you were saying earlier, the device must have had a failsafe mechanism built in, to avoid killing people accidentally in case the person operating the device does not follow the proper safety protocols. We were sent to this exact same place the last time when our teleportation went wrong, and I doubt that was a coincidence."

"Do you have any idea why they would want to teleport us out of the rebel base, instead of just leaving us there?" Leila writes. "Could it have something to do with my father?"

 As we are moving through the tunnels, we suddenly hear the faint echo of a wall being smashed somewhere relatively far from us. Leila and I have now stopped in our tracks and we are looking at each other apprehensively, not entirely sure how to react to this.

"That didn't sound like an explosion," I say. "It sounded more like someone punching their way through one of the cavern's walls."

"So it must have been either Hadrik... or Gontrok," Leila writes.

#if(v_b3_ch6_transceivers != 2) {
 "It's possible," I say. "They surely must have known that you were his daughter, considering that the teleporter guy was their informant, so maybe they were planning to have you work as his assistant, or something. The fact that I was also teleported here along with you was probably just an accident, caused by the fact that you happened to be holding onto me at the time."

"I see," Leila writes. "In that case, it's probably just a matter of time until they find out where we are and send some guards after us. Maybe we should try to quicken our pace a little."

After a few more minutes of walking, we finally reach the place where Breynan and Illuna deactivated the first magical trap yesterday, and we keep moving forward while attempting to use our magical sense to figure out if there is anyone following us or not. So far, it doesn't really seem like there's anyone in these tunnels except us, but with the large quantity of seredium in these walls, it is hard to tell for sure. 

If our pursuers were to hide their auras properly, then I don't think there would be any way for us to detect them, but then again the same thing goes for them as well. Considering that we've been making sure to conceal our auras ever since we began travelling through these corridors, our enemies should have a really hard time tracking us down by using only their magical sense. Ultimately, I think it will all boil down to how well each of us will be able to navigate through this maze-like place without getting lost.

 "It was probably Hadrik," I say. "He and the others must have forced the teleporter guy to send them here after they heard what happened to us!"

"Don't you think they would have tried to call us through the transceivers as soon as they got here?" Leila writes.

"They most likely did, but then they realized that there were too many seredium walls between us and them, and that's why they started destroying them!" I say. "Let me try calling Hadrik on the transceiver. Maybe we can reach him now!"

"If you say so..." Leila writes, looking rather unconvinced by my arguments.

I then take out my transceiver and try contacting Hadrik, but unfortunately, I can't seem to reach him.

"Hey, Hadrik, can you hear me?" I shout loudly, as I put my transceiver back in my pocket. "We're over here--mmghf"

Before I get to finish what I was about to say, Leila rushes over to me and she puts both her hands over my mouth, silencing me.

 "Barry, what do you think you're doing?!" Leila writes, as she is still preventing me from speaking. "What if that's Gontrok out there and not Hadrik?"

"Oh, I can hear you, alright!" I hear Gontrok shouting from a distance. "Stay where you are! I'll be right with you as soon as I smash through a few more of these walls."

"Ah crap," I say, as the sound of another wall being smashed can be heard somewhere closer to us. "Sorry about that."

"...Normally he shouldn't be able to pinpoint our location just from hearing us once," Leila writes. "Let's try to move further away from here. Hopefully, that will make him lose our tracks."

"Alright, let's go," I say.

 As we are advancing towards the seredium tower, we keep hearing Gontrok destroying walls somewhere far away from us but he appears to be punching them at random, without actually trying to go in any specific direction. Maybe he's hoping that once he smashes through enough of the seredium walls he will eventually be able to sense our auras? While I am attempting to decipher the meaning behind Gontrok's strange actions, the giant begins shouting his lungs out once more, this time calling out to one of his associates instead of us.

"Are you happy now, you stupid illusionist?!" Gontrok says. "Did I finally clear enough space for you to be able to cast your lousy spell?"

Right after Gontrok is done talking, all of the corridors inside the cave get filled with a bright green light and as soon as the light fades, a line made out of green smoke appears out of thin air, which as far as I can tell seems to be marking the exact path that we've been following ever since we were teleported to these caverns.

"So, I just need to follow this trail of smoke, right?" Gontrok shouts loudly again. "Well, then! Sorry to have kept you waiting, friends of Hadrik. I'll be there with you shortly!"

"Damn it," I say. "We need to get away from the green smoke. Run!"

"Alright, let's go," I say.

 Not long after we start moving, we hear Gontrok shouting from a distance, confirming our suspicions.

"Where are you hiding, you cowards?" Gontrok says. "I know you're there! Show yourselves!"

 We start running through the tunnel, but the smoke keeps following our every move and no matter what we do, we aren't able to shake it off. Just as we are about to turn another corner, Gontrok dashes past us at a breathtaking speed and he stops in front of us, blocking our path.

"Well, well, if it isn't the silver-haired princess and her not-so-charming prince," Gontrok says. "I'd love to stay and chat with you, but unfortunately the king has ordered me to bring the lessathi tinkerer's daughter to him alive and unharmed, so I don't have any time to waste. How about we make a deal? You hand over the girl to me, and I'll let you get away with only two broken legs. I'd say that's a more than reasonable compromise, considering the alternative--"

Before Gontrok gets to finish what he was saying, Leila makes a very quick dash towards him, aiming both her blades straight for his neck. Gontrok instinctively steps out of the way, but Leila attacks him again, right as he is regaining his footing. After dodging Leila's slashes a few more times, Gontrok gets tired of being on the defensive, and he attempts to grab her with both his hands.

Seeing that her opponent is finally retaliating, Leila jumps backwards and then she looks Gontrok in the eye, while she makes her blue writing appear in front of him.

"I thought you were supposed to bring me to the king 'alive and unharmed'," Leila writes. "Why are you fighting back all of a sudden?"

"Well, well, if it isn't the silver-haired princess and her smart-mouthed prince," Gontrok says. "My orders from the king are to bring the lessathi tinkerer's daughter to him alive and unharmed, but that can wait. That insolent whelp over there had the nerve to call me a coward to my face during our last encounter and I intend to teach him a lesson or two before I--"

 "Shut up," Gontrok says, after he reads Leila's writing. "The king never said that I'm not allowed to grab and immobilize you. And besides, that attack of yours was just for show, wasn't it? Now that I take a better look at your weapons, neither you nor your bodyguard over there have blades sharp enough to pass through a giant's skin, no matter how strong your attacks may be."

"You really believe that you can accurately tell how many enchantments a dagger has on it just by looking at it?" Leila writes. "Don't you think this overconfidence of yours might end up costing you your life someday?"

"Hah!" Gontrok says. "Someday, maybe. But not today. If you think you've got what it takes to kill me, then why don't we make a little bet? I will stand here in place for one full minute and during this time you can try to slit my throat, cut my head off, or whatever. I won't dodge and I won't defend myself in any way. However... if I am still left standing after that minute passes, you will come with me to visit the king of your own free will, without posing any resistance. What do you say?"

"You're going to regret this," Leila writes, giving Gontrok a cold stare while she readies her daggers.

Gontrok laughs, and then he grins maliciously at Leila. 

"We have a deal, then!" he says.

 "Ready when you are, princess," Gontrok says. "I'll start counting the sixty seconds as soon as you hit your first attack."

Leila nods, and almost immediately afterwards she dashes towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to slit his throat with both her daggers. At the exact same time, I also make a rush for Gontrok, using my own dagger to try and cut through his neck from behind. 

Despite our best efforts, however, our blades are easily stopped by the giant's thick skin and neither of our cuts is deep enough to even draw blood. 

"I don't recall giving you permission to attack me at the same time as her, runt," Gontrok tells me, as he turns his head slightly in my direction.

"Who says I need your permission?" I say, as I strike him one more time.

"Cheeky as always, I see," Gontrok says. "Looks like I'll have to break that arm of yours to teach you a proper lesson, once this is over."

 After a few more unsuccessful attempts at cutting the giant's throat, Leila suddenly decides to change her target, this time aiming to stab her opponent in the eye instead. Predictably, this forces Gontrok to retreat, making a quick jump backwards to avoid Leila's blade.

"Hey, now," Gontrok tells Leila, looking mildly upset, "this wasn't part of our deal. I thought I said you were allowed to slit my throat or cut my head off, not stab me in the eye."

"You said I could slit your throat, cut your head off or 'whatever'," Leila writes. "The 'whatever' part of your statement implies that I could also attack you in any other way I'd see fit."

"What I meant by that was that you could attack me in whatever way you wanted, as long as you'd still be aiming for my neck," Gontrok says.

"Then maybe you should have been more specific with your phrasing," Leila writes.

"You tried to stab me in the damn eye!" Gontrok says, now looking a bit angrier than before. "You broke our arrangement!"

"So did you, by moving away from your spot before the sixty seconds were up," Leila writes. "From my point of view, you are the one who lost the bet, not me."

 "It appears that we are at an impasse, then," Gontrok says, with his eyebrows furrowed.

"So it would seem," Leila writes.

"I really didn't want to do this, but it looks like I have no choice," Gontrok says. "I'm sure that the king would rather have you brought to him with a broken wrist or two than not at all. I should warn you that I won't be taking it easy on you anymore from now on. Prepare yourself."

"Less talking. More fighting," Leila writes.

"As you wish," Gontrok says.

"Leila, let's fight him together!" I say.

Leila nods at me, and then we both get in our battle stances, waiting for Gontrok to initiate the brawl.

Leila nods, and almost immediately afterwards she dashes towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to slit his throat with both her daggers. Despite her best efforts, however, Leila's blades are easily stopped by the giant's thick skin and neither of her cuts is deep enough to even draw blood.

"Did you seriously think that a barefaced lie like this would-- work on-- wait a minute, what did you just say?..." Gontrok says, suddenly appearing a lot less confident than before.

"I said these weapons have the same enchantments on them as Daren's sword," I answer him. "Shouldn't that have been obvious from the start? We're his teammates, and he's an enchanter. Of course he'd be more than happy to enchant our blades."

"No, that's not how it works!" Gontrok says, in an increasingly more uncertain tone. "These enchantments require many resources... and time! Lots of time! There's no way he could have--"

"Hey, man, feel free to think whatever you want!" I say. "I just wanted to warn you, that's all. Have fun with your pathetic dishonorable death. I'm sure the gods will welcome you with open arms in their banquet halls when they'll learn how you spent your final moments on this earthen plane."

"Gontrok, prepare yourself," Leila writes. "I'm going to try slitting your throat first. Make sure that you don't move an inch."

 "Whoa, there..." Gontrok says, as he's now starting to sweat a little. "Give me a little more time to think this over before--"

"Here I go," Leila writes, and then she makes a quick dash towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to cut his throat with both her daggers.

In a moment of panic, Gontrok forgets all about his deal with Leila and he jumps backwards, avoiding her strikes entirely. Realizing what he's done, the giant now turns his head towards Leila, wide-eyed, waiting to see her reaction.

"You broke the deal," Leila writes, simply. "You weren't supposed to move from that spot before the sixty seconds were up. This means that I win and you'll leave us alone. Correct?"

"No!" Gontrok shouts. "That's not what happened! I told you that I needed some more time to think things over and you just ran at me without even--"

"You told me that you needed more time after we had both already agreed to take the bet," Leila writes. "You never mentioned any delay in our initial arrangement. Are you saying that you are going back on your word?"

 "No, of course not!" Gontrok says. "There is no honor in breaking one's word!"

"So, you will let us go, then?" Leila writes, calmly.

"I-- but my orders-- I don't-- Argh! Screw this!" Gontrok says. "A deal's a deal! I'd rather die than lose my honor because of something as stupid as this. You're free to go. Now get the hell out of my sight!"

"What did you just say?!" we suddenly hear the voice of the illusionist royal guard that we heard arguing with Gontrok yesterday before they teleported away.

Just like the last time, the royal guard's voice appears to be coming from all around us, and it is impossible to sense his aura, even though I'm sure he must be hiding invisibly somewhere in this corridor.

"Are you implying that I could do something as dishonorable as breaking my word?" Gontrok says, looking positively disgusted.

"We barely know you," Leila writes. "We have no reason to believe that you're any more honorable than a common cutthroat. All we have is your word."

 While I am distracting Gontrok, Leila is somehow able to position herself behind him, but instead of attacking him while his back his turned, she moves to his side so that she can try to stab him in the eyes again. This forces my opponent to stop chasing me for a few moments, so he can defend himself.

As I am getting this brief moment of respite, I cannot help but notice that there is something strange going on with Gontrok's aura, although I can't tell exactly what's wrong with it from a simple glance.

}
#if(v_magical_sense >= 4) {
 

After a few seconds of focusing on the giant's aura, I finally figure out why I thought there was something strange about it. In fact it wasn't the aura itself that caught my attention, but the flow of magic inside of it that is specific to someone who is currently shapeshifting. The flow is clearly unstable. I've studied how shapeshifting is supposed to work, and none of what he is doing is standard procedure. He must be using some sort of poorly modified version of the normal shapeshifting spell so that he can gain wings and other useful appendages without the need to fully transform himself into a different creature. Maybe there is some way in which I can turn this instability of his aura into an advantage for me?

As I am standing there, thinking, Gontrok attacks me again with an extremely quick punch, making me jump behind to dodge him while Leila is once more looking for a good opportunity to flank my opponent. It feels like there are dozens of concurrent thoughts racing through my head while I'm avoiding Gontrok's seemingly endless attacks. Out of all the ideas that are coming to me right now, two in particular seem rather promising, but they both involve using a variation of Leila's father's massage technique to mess with the giant's aura.

 If I could find the right pressure points, I might be able to briefly stun him or to at least make him feel a strong feeling of nausea, but to do this while he is focusing all of his attacks on me might be a little risky. The second idea would be for me to tell Leila to use the pressure point technique on Gontrok while I'm keeping him busy, but I'm not sure if she would be able to modify the massage technique correctly unless I give her a very specific step by step guide in the middle of the battle.

Both options have their ups and downs, so I guess I'm going to have to go with my instincts, on this one.

"What in the blazes were you trying to do just now? Prick me in the neck?" Gontrok asks me, as he uncomfortably massages the back of his neck with his hand. "You'd better take this fight seriously if you don't want to end up splattered on that wall."

"Then I will give you the death that you deserve," Gontrok says. "The death of a pathetic coward."

He then jumps at me and he begins to attack me with an elaborate series of feints that are meant to trick my overly sensitive reflexes into making me dodge at the wrong time, thus leaving myself vulnerable.

I am able to predict his feints the first few times, but eventually it gets too hard to guess when he's about to hit me for real or not, so I have no choice but to begin relying exclusively on my reflexes to evade his next attacks. This is unfortunately exactly what Gontrok was waiting for, and as soon as he sees me dodging one of his feints, he immediately follows it up with a punch so hard that it goes right through my head and it shatters my cranium in a single motion.

After successfully predicting his first few feints, I suddenly realize that this isn't just a random set of movements that he invented on the spot but a tactic that already exists and that I know about thanks to my combat technique stat. If the information I have is true, then it should be easy enough to distinguish the fake attacks from the real ones, because whenever he actually wants to hit me, he will get a little closer to me so that his punches can have more of an impact. If I don't see him trying to close the gap between us too much, then he's probably just going for a feint. With this info, I should be able to hold out against him long enough for Leila to give me another opening. Let's see if it works.

Surely enough, after several more strikes coming from Gontrok, my suspicions get confirmed and I can now say without a shadow of a doubt that he is indeed using the technique I was thinking of.  I avoid his attacks for a while longer until Leila finally distracts him once more, and then I quickly continue from where I left off the last time, joining my fingers together again and hitting several more spots at the back of Gontrok's neck, as I can feel the flow of his aura getting more and more erratic.

"I said knock it off!" Gontrok shouts all of a sudden, as he turns towards me and begins attacking me even faster than before.

The feints he is using now are getting increasingly more complex, and I can barely keep up with them anymore.

Due to the immense pressure that I'm currently under, I misread one of Gontrok's punches and do not dodge it in time. His strike was so strong that it fractured my skull in an instant and it sent my lifeless body tumbling down to the floor in the next second.

It is only thanks to my very advanced knowledge of martial arts that I somehow manage to stay alive long enough for Leila to once again distract Gontrok and to give me the chance I need to finally perfect my aura disrupting technique. As Gontrok turns his back once more, I quickly hit the back of his neck with my fingers a few more times, except that now I finally feel like I know what I'm doing. Before Gontrok gets the chance to turn around, his aura goes completely haywire and judging by his reaction, this is clearly having as much of an impact on him as I was hoping.

 "Ugh!" Gontrok says, as he is grabbing his forehead with both his hands. "What did you do to me, you sneaky bastard?!"

"Not much," I say. "I just made you feel some strong nausea. Don't worry, it will pass soon. For more reasons than one. Leila, get ready!"

I then kick Gontrok in the back of one of his knees and I pull him by the shoulders, making him fall on his back. As the giant instinctively puts both his hands below him while he falls, Leila takes advantage of his temporary lack of defense to pounce on him with both her daggers aiming for his eyes. Just when she's about to deliver the finishing blow, a very high-pitched shrieking noise fills the room and for some reason, immediately afterwards we all lose strength in our muscles for a few seconds, causing us to involuntarily drop our weapons.

Having been saved by this mysterious ally, Gontrok quickly gets back up from the ground and he looks around, as if he were trying to find the source of the sound he just heard.

 "I thought I told you to not interfere with my battles, illusionist," Gontrok says. "This was your doing, wasn't it? Where are you hiding this time? Show yourself!"

"If you want to get yourself killed, then you can do it in your own free time," we suddenly hear the voice of the illusionist royal guard that we heard arguing with Gontrok yesterday before they teleported away. "You have been given an order from the king, in case you've forgotten, and you are expected to stay alive until that order has been carried out."

Just like the last time, the royal guard's voice appears to be coming from all around us, and it is impossible to sense his aura, even though I'm sure he must be hiding invisibly somewhere in this corridor. Gontrok also appears to be a little confused when speaking to his ally, because he's already been looking in three different places since they started their conversation.

 I continue to avoid Gontrok's attacks until Leila flanks him again from the side, and then in the few seconds during which he's not paying attention to me, I try to quickly communicate to Leila what I want her to do.

"Hey, Leila," I say. "Could you try using a technique similar to your father's massage on Gontrok? Basically, what I need you to do is to join your fingers together and hit several pressure points on the back of his neck instead of pressing your whole palm on his forehead."

"But... how would that be the same as my father's technique, then?..." Leila writes, confused, as Gontrok has now stopped to look at me with wide eyes, probably wondering if I'd gone mad.

"The fact that you have to use pressure points to affect his aura is the same, but the method is slightly different," I say. "Don't worry, I'll try to guide you step by step."

"You want to give me a massage, now?" Gontrok asks me. "Are these the last ramblings of a man that has already accepted his death? Why don't you come here, so I can put you out of your misery?"

"Leila, do it now!" I say, as I rush to attack Gontrok with my dagger.

"Your dagger won't work on me, you buffoon," Gontrok says, as I attack him and then quickly step back so that he doesn't have time to grab my weapon.

 At the same time, Leila joins her fingers together and hits Gontrok in the neck several times from behind, like I told her, but it doesn't seem to be having much of an effect on his aura.

"And giving me neck massages isn't going to help you either!" Gontrok says, as he attempts to grab Leila again, but she steps back just in time.

"Leila, let's try it one more time, but slower," I say. "I'll tell you when it will start to work."

"You two are really testing my patience..." Gontrok says, and then he begins to attack me once again, forcing me to get back.

Leila tries to disrupt the giant's aura a few more times while I'm keeping him distracted, but ultimately she does not manage to figure out how she's supposed to modify her father's technique to give Gontrok a headache, and it is too difficult for me to show her what she needs to do while I'm busy avoiding my opponent's punches. After a few more failed attempts of Leila and me trying to defeat Gontrok, we suddenly sense the presence of a familiar dark-skinned mercenary who is apparently now slowly making his way into our corridor.

"Sorry to interrupt," Loyrang says, in his usual casual tone, while his hands are positioned near the hilts of his two blades, ready to unsheathe them if the need arises. "I was going to let you finish your fight but it was taking a little too long so I got bored of waiting until the end."

I decide that I shouldn't waste the precious little time I have by looking at an aura, and that I should try to formulate a plan of attack, instead. Unfortunately, Leila's distraction does not work for very long, and Gontrok soon attacks me again with an extremely quick punch, making me jump back in order to dodge him.

As I am once more struggling to avoid Gontrok's seemingly endless attacks, I keep trying to figure out a way to beat him without using weapons, but after going through all the plausible scenarios in my head, the only realistic solution I can think of is still to keep evading him until he gives up, either from fatigue or from boredom. There are two of us, so as long as we can conserve our stamina properly by having him attack us in turns, we might just be able to pull it off.

After I dodge a few more of his strikes, Gontrok suddenly stops chasing me and he gives me a look of utter contempt, as he watches me waiting for him at a relatively safe distance.

"What exactly are you trying to do here? Avoid my attacks until I decide to leave you alone out of boredom?" Gontrok says. "You'd better take this fight seriously if you don't want to end up splattered on that wall."

"Shouldn't you be saying things like that after you've managed to hit me at least once?..." I ask Gontrok. "Not to be rude or anything, but your threats are feeling kind of empty right now."

#if(v_combat_technique < 2) {
 "I will hit you as soon as you stop running around in circles like some chicken without a head," Gontrok says angrily. "How about you fight like a man instead of continuing to disgrace yourself by acting in such a cowardly way?"

"I will fight however I please, thank you very much," I tell him.

"Then I will give you the death that you deserve," Gontrok says. "The death of a pathetic coward."

He then jumps at me and he begins to attack me with an elaborate series of feints that are meant to trick my overly sensitive reflexes into making me dodge at the wrong time, thus leaving myself vulnerable.

I am able to predict his feints the first few times, but eventually it gets too hard to guess when he's about to hit me for real or not, so I have no choice but to begin relying exclusively on my reflexes to evade his next attacks. This is unfortunately exactly what Gontrok was waiting for, and as soon as he sees me dodging one of his feints, he immediately follows it up with a punch so hard that it goes right through my head and it shatters my cranium in a single motion.

After successfully predicting his first few feints, I suddenly realize that this isn't just a random set of movements that he invented on the spot but a tactic that already exists and that I know about thanks to my combat technique stat. If the information I have is true, then it should be easy enough to distinguish the fake attacks from the real ones, because whenever he actually wants to hit me, he will get a little closer to me so that his punches can have more of an impact. If I don't see him trying to close the gap between us too much, then he's probably just going for a feint. With this info, I should be able to hold out against him long enough for Leila to find another opening to try and stab him in the eyes again. Let's see if it works.

 Surely enough, after several more strikes coming from Gontrok, my suspicions get confirmed and I can now say without a shadow of a doubt that he is indeed using the technique I was thinking of.  I avoid his attacks for a while longer until Leila finally goes for his eyes, forcing him to jump back and to take his focus off me momentarily.

It is only thanks to my very advanced knowledge of martial arts that I somehow manage to stay alive long enough for Leila to once again distract Gontrok and to give me the time to catch my breath. As I am now analyzing Gontrok's attack patterns a little more calmly, I realize that his latest tactics aren't all that different from the ones he used before, except for the fact that their increased speed is making them much more confusing. As long as I can keep this in mind while I fight him, I should still be one step ahead of him at all times, so there would be no reason to worry about getting hit.

 Leila and I continue to fight Gontrok in the same way for a while longer, but it is getting increasingly obvious by the minute that we are not making much progress.

 Okay, so I've probably only got a few seconds until Leila starts attacking Gontrok. What could we possibly do to defeat him without using our weapons? Think, Barry. Think!

"Ready when you are, princess," Gontrok says. "I'll start counting the sixty seconds as soon as you hit your first attack."

Leila nods, and almost immediately afterwards she dashes towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to slit his throat with both her daggers. Despite her best efforts, however, Leila's blades are easily stopped by the giant's thick skin and neither of her cuts is deep enough to even draw blood. 

"Is that all you got?" Gontrok taunts her. "And here I was, hoping for an actual challenge! What a disappointment."

As Leila prepares to hit him again, I suddenly come up with an idea that might just work, but I won't know for sure until I test it. Let's give it a try.

I move behind Gontrok, I join the fingers of my right hand together and then I use them to hit the back of his neck several times, while closely monitoring the flow of his aura.

 "Hey, stop trying to prick my neck, you damn imbecile!" Gontrok says. "Have you gone mad? I said stop it!"

"What's the matter, Gontrok?" Leila writes. "Afraid of a little massage?"

"I'm not afraid of anything!" Gontrok says furiously. "He can massage me all he wants, but as soon as your sixty seconds are up, he's dead!"

I ignore Gontrok's ramblings and I continue with what I was doing. If my gut feeling is right, then if I try a variation of Leila's father's massage technique, I might be able to disrupt the giant's aura enough to get him to drop off his feet, which would make him automatically lose his bet with Leila since he's not allowed to move. All I need to do is find the right pressure points.

 Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be going as well as I was hoping. Maybe it would be a better idea to ask Leila for help, since she clearly knows how to use her father's technique better than I do.

"Hey, Leila, could you try to do the same thing I'm doing, but from the opposite side?" I say. "I'm trying to improvise a modified version of your father's massage technique, but I can't quite seem to get what I'm doing wrong."

"But why would you-- wait, I think I understand what you're going for," Leila writes, as she looks more closely at the movements of my hands. "Let me see if I can figure out how to do it properly."

She then sheathes her daggers and she joins her fingers together just like me, so that she can begin poking Gontrok's throat with them.

"You two are really beginning to get on my nerves, you know that?" Gontrok says. 

Leila does not react to Gontrok's words, as she is now focusing all of her attention on her technique. After a few failed attempts, Leila finally finds the correct pressure points and once she stops moving her fingers, I can immediately sense the giant's aura going completely haywire.

"Ugh!" Gontrok says, as he is now grabbing his forehead with both his hands. "What did you do to me, you sneaky bastards?!"

 "Well..." I say, while I am watching Gontrok take two small steps backwards to avoid losing his balance. "It looks like what we did to you is that we made you lose the bet. You weren't supposed to move from that spot until the sixty seconds were over, but I saw you taking two steps back just now. You're not going to deny that, are you?"

"I only took two steps back because you tricked me!" Gontrok says, as he is still struggling to deal with his headache. "That wasn't a massage, it was something else! It wasn't part of the deal!"

"And yet, you said very clearly earlier that you weren't going to cancel the bet because of what Barry was doing," Leila writes. "You also told me that I could attack your neck in whatever way I wanted, not only with my daggers. Are you saying that you are going back on your word?"

#if(v_b3_ch7_massage == 2) {
 For some reason, my improvised technique seems to be having much more of an effect on his aura than I was expecting. I must be a lot better at this than I thought! After a few more seconds of me hitting the back of his neck, his aura goes completely haywire, and I can already tell that this is having a great impact on the giant from the way he is reacting.

"Ugh!" Gontrok says, as he is now grabbing his forehead with both his hands. "What did you do to me, you sneaky bastard?!"

"I'm not exactly sure either," I say, while I am watching Gontrok take two small steps backwards to avoid losing his balance. "But what I do know is that you just lost the bet. You weren't supposed to move from that spot until the sixty seconds were over, but I saw you taking two steps back just now. You're not going to deny that, are you?"

 "I only took two steps back because you tricked me!" Gontrok says, as he is still struggling to deal with his headache. "That wasn't a massage, it was something else! It wasn't part of the deal!"

"And yet, you said very clearly earlier that you weren't going to cancel the bet because of what Barry was doing," Leila writes. "Are you saying that you are going back on your word?"

 "No, of course not!" Gontrok says, as his headache seems to be getting better. "There is no honor in breaking one's word!"

"So, you will let us go, then?" Leila writes, calmly.

"I-- but my orders-- I don't-- Argh! Screw this!" Gontrok says. "Just because the two of you are honorless dogs who resort to petty tricks to win does not mean that I should stoop down to your level. A deal's a deal! You're free to go. Now get the hell out of my sight!"

"What did you just say?!" we suddenly hear the voice of the illusionist royal guard that we heard arguing with Gontrok yesterday before they teleported away.

Just like the last time, the royal guard's voice appears to be coming from all around us, and it is impossible to sense his aura, even though I'm sure he must be hiding invisibly somewhere in this corridor.

 "You're the one who came up with all these grand schemes, Gontrok, not me," Loyrang answers Gontrok, acting as if the illusionist never said anything. "I'm a mercenary. I'm only in it for the money. Joining the royal guards with you seemed like a good idea at the time, but lately it's been a little more trouble than it's worth. That's why I decided yesterday that it was about time to cut my losses and to try my luck elsewhere."

"So you were going to leave just like that?" Gontrok shouts. "Without even saying a word to me?"

"And what was I supposed to say, hmm?" Loyrang asks. "Would you have left the city with me if I asked you to do it? Of course you wouldn't. You've already put too much effort into this ruse of yours for you to even consider abandoning your plans. There was no use speaking to you about it, because I already knew what you were going to say."

"So, now you're going to have the king killed and ruin all of my ambitions without a second thought, is that it?" Gontrok says angrily.

 "Be serious, Gontrok," Loyrang says. "Your ridiculous plans would have never worked in a million years. Can't you see that you're not even capable of having a normal conversation with me without giving away all of your secret plans to one of the king's most trusted allies? The king has obviously been aware of your hidden ambitions from the very beginning. The only reason why he kept you around him was because he suspected the organizers of rigging the protection spell in such a way that it would malfunction against citizens from Ollendor, and he wanted to have someone powerful defending him from the other tournament participants just in case. You're nothing but a useful tool to him. I assure you that he is planning to dispose of you the minute after the tournament is over."

"You can't know that!" Gontrok says.

"Of course I can!" Loyrang says. "I know people! It doesn't take me much to figure out what opinion the king has of you. I could see it all on his face every time he spoke with you. The man doesn't trust you one bit. He's been leading you on this whole time. He's been using your own greed against you to keep you on a leash. That's why he made you the new captain. He knows exactly what you're after, and he isn't afraid to give you what you want in order to avoid raising your suspicions. He wants you to be his loyal dog until the moment when he'll no longer need you, at which point he'll have you executed without a second thought."

 "You're the one who came up with all these grand schemes, Gontrok, not me," Loyrang answers Gontrok, acting as if the illusionist never said anything. "I'm a mercenary. I'm only in it for the money. Joining the royal guards with you seemed like a good idea at the time, but lately it's been a little more trouble than it's worth. That's why I decided yesterday that it was about time to cut my losses and to try my luck elsewhere."

"So you were going to leave just like that?" Gontrok shouts. "Without even saying a word to me?"

"And what was I supposed to say, hmm?" Loyrang asks. "Would you have left the city with me if I asked you to do it? Of course you wouldn't. You've already put too much effort into this ruse of yours for you to even consider abandoning your plans. There was no use speaking to you about it, because I already knew what you were going to say."

"So, now you're going to have the king killed and ruin all of my ambitions without a second thought, is that it?" Gontrok says angrily.

 "Be serious, Gontrok," Loyrang says. "Your ridiculous plans would have never worked in a million years. Can't you see that you're not even capable of having a normal conversation with me without giving away all of your secret plans to one of the king's most trusted allies? The king has obviously been aware of your hidden ambitions from the very beginning. The only reason why he kept you around him was because he suspected the organizers of rigging the protection spell in such a way that it would malfunction against citizens from Ollendor, and he wanted to have someone powerful defending him from the other tournament participants just in case. You're nothing but a useful tool to him. I assure you that he is planning to dispose of you the minute after the tournament is over."

"You can't know that!" Gontrok says.

"Of course I can!" Loyrang says. "I know people! It doesn't take me much to figure out what opinion the king has of you. I could see it all on his face every time he spoke with you. The man doesn't trust you one bit. He's been leading you on this whole time. He's been using your own greed against you to keep you on a leash. That's why he made you the new captain. He knows exactly what you're after, and he isn't afraid to give you what you want in order to avoid raising your suspicions. He wants you to be his loyal dog until the moment when he'll no longer need you, at which point he'll have you executed without a second thought."

 "You're going to kill the king? Perfect! Less work for us, then!"

"No, no, you misunderstand," Loyrang says. "When I said I would 'get' him killed, what I meant was that I would help you do it. I still can't attack any of the locals due to the tournament spell's effects, remember?"

"You will pay for this, you traitor!" the illusionist says. "Gontrok, what are you standing there for? Kill him immediately!"

"Loyrang, why are you doing this?" Gontrok says. "I thought we were a team! Why would you want to abandon everything that we've built here? The king has already agreed to appoint me as the new royal guard captain! It's only a matter of time until I convince him that all the other kingdoms are out to get him, and then we'll finally get to put all of this technologically advanced arsenal to proper use! With the king of Ollendor as our puppet, we will conquer all of the other cities of Varathia, and we will become the rulers of this continent. Isn't this what you also wanted?"

 "I've heard enough of this!" Gontrok says. "You're not going to help anyone kill the king. I won't let you."

"Is that supposed to be a threat?" Loyrang says, in his characteristic laidback tone. "Gontrok, my friend... Have you never wondered why I decided to travel together with you when I came across you on the first day of the tournament? Did you really think that I would risk walking side by side all this time with someone that I thought would have even the slightest chance of defeating me in battle? You clearly must not know me very well."

"So, first you insult my intelligence, and now you insult my combat prowess?" Gontrok says, as he seems to barely be able to contain his rage. "Do you seriously think that you can afford to be so confident just because those weapons of yours are sharp enough to cut through my skin?"

"Trust me, it's not just because of the sharpness of my weapons that I am being confident," Loyrang says. "If you don't believe me, you're free to test my skills whenever you're ready. Just don't blame me if you lose an arm or two in the process..."

Gontrok suddenly lets out a laugh, but it's not the kind of laugh that someone lets out when they're being amused by something. It's more the kind of laugh that you would normally expect to hear from someone who is only a few moments away from snapping.

 "What a day this has been..." Gontrok says, once he's done laughing. "First I had to babysit that whiney teleporter guy, then I got taken for a fool by these two chumps, and now my trusted comrade-in-arms tells me that he's about to cut my arms off. And to top it all off, there is this most annoying buzzing sound in the background going on and on and on while I'm trying to talk, and it's PISSING ME OFF!!!"

Gontrok is right. I'm not sure exactly when it started, but all of the blue crystals that are embedded in the cavern walls around us have been vibrating for a while, and it feels like they're getting louder by the second. Gontrok pauses for a few moments, hoping that the sound might go away by itself, but when he realizes that it's only going to get louder from now on, he raises his voice, probably in an attempt to drown out the noise coming from the crystals.

 "So, you want to show me how much stronger you are, Loyrang?! Gontrok shouts. "Is that it? Or maybe your strategy is to fool me into thinking that it's going to be a fair fight but you've instead laid a trap for me on the floor in front of me? I know your type... You're not planning to fight fair at all, are you? Don't try to lie to me; I know what you non-giants are like. You're all the same! Every single one of you! Would it kill you people to fight with at least some shred of dignity? Does honor mean nothing to you? Is there-- ARGH, will this thrice-damned noise never end?! What is wrong with these crystals? Can't you see that I'm trying to have a conversation here?! Be silent, damn you! I said BE QUIET!!!"

As he is shouting those last two words, Gontrok furiously hits one of the crystals from the wall on his left with the side of his fist. Instead of shattering, however, the crystal begins to emit a blue light that is much brighter than the one before, which fills up the whole corridor and effectively blinds us for a few seconds. Then, as we are all slowly regaining our sight, we suddenly hear Gontrok's scream, full of both anger and utter disbelief.

ID: B3-Ch07a-Fingers
TEXT:

 "What the hell is this?!" Gontrok shouts, while showing us his left hand.

What I am now seeing is extremely hard to put into words. It looks as if his left hand had been essentially cut in half, with its pinky finger and its ring finger missing entirely, as well as the two knuckles corresponding to them and the left side of his palm. Yet somehow, his hand looks like it's been that way ever since he was born. Not only is there no blood coming out of the missing fingers, but there is also no scar tissue to be seen. If someone were to see his hand now for the first time, there would be no reason for them to believe that those two missing fingers ever existed.

But that is not all... For a fraction of a second, when I first laid eyes upon his hand after the blinding flash of blue light, I was almost convinced that his hand had been like this the whole time. Even though I still have clear memories of his hand being intact only moments ago, I was on the verge of believing that Gontrok's left hand has had only three fingers since the very beginning. As I am struggling to understand how something like this could have happened, Gontrok shouts again, while taking a good look at every person in the room beside him.

"Why are you all looking at me like that, you daft fools?!" Gontrok says, as he is holding up his left hand to make sure that everyone can see it properly. "Do you not have eyes? I'll ask again. What the HELL is this?!"

 "What do you mean 'what is this'?..." Loyrang says. "It's your hand. Have you seriously gone so far off the deep end that you've forgotten what your left hand looks like?"

"Look at the fingers, you imbecile!" Gontrok shouts. "Do you not see that there are only three?!"

"Yes, there are only three fingers on your left hand," Loyrang says. "There have always been only three fingers on your left hand. Do you expect us to pity you now? Are you going to tell me that you want me to fight you with one hand behind my back to even the odds?"

"You are taking this joke too far, Loyrang," Gontrok says. "These two fingers disappeared out of the blue after I hit the crystal with them and you know it! You saw it happen with your own eyes! You were all here!"

"Gontrok, snap out of it!" the illusionist says. "This traitorous bastard must have cast some sort of mind affecting spell on you while we were distracted by the blue light. Listen to me. You've never had more than three fingers on your left hand. It is the way you were born. Don't get fooled by a simple trick like this, damn it!"

As the three royal guards are arguing, Leila pulls me lightly by the sleeve and when I turn to look at her, I can see that she is looking rather distraught.

"Barry... please tell me that I'm not going crazy," Leila writes. "You also remember Gontrok having five fingers on his left hand before, right? It's not just some mind affecting spell. Those fingers really existed... right?"

"Barry..." Leila writes. "You already knew I would be able to tell that you were lying before you said that, didn't you?"

"I did know that, yes," I answer her.

Right after I say this, Leila punches me lightly in the arm.

"Well, I suppose I am at least grateful that you didn't see the need to use your bluff stat on me to fool me for real," Leila writes. "That would have meant taking the joke a little too far."

"Hey, even I'm not that insensitive!" I say.

"Right..." Leila writes, looking somewhat unconvinced. "So, do you have any idea what might have happened after Gontrok hit that crystal?"

"Well, the fingers that were the closest to the crystal are the ones that disappeared," I say, "so my guess is that these crystals must have some sort of defense mechanism that activates itself when someone attacks them. What I can't really wrap my head around is the reason why there was no blood or even any scar tissue left after half of his hand was practically cut off.

 As I say those words, a sudden chill travels throughout my entire body, and I begin to shiver uncontrollably while drops of cold sweat are slowly forming on the side of my forehead. If Gontrok's fingers have really been removed from existence altogether, then the only entity I know that is capable of doing something like this is the Magium itself. Does this mean that these crystals are connected to the Magium somehow? Is the Magium watching us right now?

I suddenly begin to turn around frantically, in order to see where each of the crystals are placed. There are so many of them. Too many to count... And they are everywhere. If the Magium really were capable of watching us through these crystals, then there would be no place for us to hide from it in these caves. We are trapped here like rats. There is no escape.

"Barry, what's gotten into you?" Leila writes. "Hey, are you reading this?"

My survival instincts are defective. Dying doesn't scare me. But what about ceasing to exist? Am I ready to spend an eternity floating in that void again? Am I ready to spend an infinitely long moment contemplating the contradiction of me existing and not existing at the same time? No, I can't go back there again... I can't give up. Not yet.

 As I am struggling to come up with a plan of action that will get us out of these caves safely, I hear Gontrok shouting to the other royal guards from somewhere slightly further down the corridor.

"I've had it with you idiots!" Gontrok shouts. "If you still don't believe me, then I am going to demonstrate it to you right now with this rock!"

He then picks up a rock from the ground with his right hand and he shows it to Loyrang.

"I am going to smash this rock into that crystal, and you will see how it disappears right before your eyes," Gontrok says. "We'll see who's the crazy one then!"

"No, don't!" I say loudly, as Gontrok raises his arm and prepares to hit the blue crystal with the rock.

Gontrok does not get to finish his swing, however, because his arm freezes in place and so does the rest of his body, as if it were being immobilized by an invisible force. While the giant struggles to break himself free of the aura technique, we see Eiden coming out of invisibility somewhere not too far behind him with his eyes closed, as always.

 "Leave it to a glorified barbarian to conclude that using a rock to smash into a crystal that has just removed his fingers from existence is a good idea," Eiden says. "Please tell me, Gontrok... How does it feel to know that the only meaningful purpose your head will ever have is to keep rain drops from falling down your throat?"

As soon as Eiden revealed himself, all of the crystals in the cave around us began to vibrate louder and more frequently than before. They're reacting to him... But why? Is it because he's a stillwater? No, that's not it. Melindra is also a stillwater and I've never seen the crystals behave this way around her. But then what is the reason?

Just as I ask myself this question, I suddenly remember how Arraka mentioned at one point that Eiden and the golden fox must have learned the food creation spell from the Magium itself. If Eiden and the fox are connected to the Magium in some way, then it could explain why the crystals are reacting like this, but why are they only vibrating and not doing something more? Just what are these crystals made of, exactly?

"So, it was you," Gontrok says, as he tries to turn his head a little so he can see Eiden with the tail of his eye. "These crystals were reacting to you all this time. You're the one doing this."

 "A brilliant deduction," Eiden says, as he is getting closer to the giant. "Now tell me, Gontrok, who gave the orders to destroy the underground rebel lair, which happens to be just as full of these blue crystals as the caverns that we are currently in? Was it you or the king?"

"The king gave the orders, but I was the one who carried them out," Gontrok says, and then he laughs. "Your precious rebels must all be dead by now, aren't they? And so are your intruder friends. I know you've been trying to help them. I'm not that stupid. I could tell what you were doing even if the king refused to see it. But now they're all dead, except for these two shmucks, here. How does that make you feel? Are you finally ready to show your true colors? Are you going to avenge your friends and kill the royal guards who massacred them?"

"Your royal guards are already dead," Eiden says. "The rebels, the king of the underground and the 'intruders' made short work of them and they will likely soon also be done with the troops that have been sent after them."

"No, that's impossible!" Gontrok shouts, as he is still holding his arm above his head with the rock in his hand, unable to move it. "You're lying! You can't--"

"Listen to me, Gontrok," Eiden says in a serious tone, as he uses his aura manipulation technique to rotate Gontrok towards him, while still keeping his right arm up in order to annoy him. "I could not care less whether you believe me or not. The only reason why I'm still keeping you alive is because I still have a question to ask you. So tell me, Gontrok, has the king mentioned anything to you about the third golden rule?"

 "Golden rule?" Gontrok says. "What kind of nonsense are you blathering about? And what is it with you humans and your cowardly techniques? Is this seriously what you call a fight? Are you planning to just hold me immobilized like this and drive a sword through my heart without even giving me a chance to defend myself? Where is your honor?"

"Honor?" Eiden says, looking genuinely confused. "Pardon me for asking, but are you not the same Gontrok that was famous for having killed the most dwarven civilians during the last great war from the Northern Continent?..."

"So what?" Gontrok says. "What does that have to do with anything?"

"Ah, I see," Eiden says. "So that's how it is..."

He then releases Gontrok from his aura technique, which prompts the giant to finally lower his arm and to drop the rock that he had been holding until now.

"You are free to attack me now," Eiden says. "I will not be using any magic whatsoever to fight you. I hope you will enjoy your last 'honorable' duel."

"I don't know what's going through that head of yours, but I'll make sure that you'll regret this," Gontrok says.

 He then rushes towards Eiden as fast as he can, trying to catch him by surprise with a quick series of punches. After a few seconds of effortlessly dodging the attacks in the same way that he dodged Daren during their first encounter, Eiden grabs Gontrok's right arm in the middle of one of his strikes, he twists it behind his back and then he hits several pressure points near his elbow in rapid succession.

Right afterwards, Eiden presses his left palm against the outside of Gontrok's elbow while still holding his arm with his other hand, and this causes the giant's forearm to bend backwards in an extremely unnatural way, while we can hear him screaming in agony.

"What did you do to me, you crazy bastard?!" Gontrok says as he is sweating something fierce, with his right arm just dangling beside him like a useless piece of meat.

"I gave you an honorable duel," Eiden says, coldly, with his eyes still closed. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

"Go plough yourself, you sadistic piece of crap!" Gontrok says, and then he tries to punch Eiden with the three remaining fingers from his left hand.

Eiden catches the incoming fist with his right hand and then he bends the giant's fingers backwards until we hear them crack. As Gontrok screams again, Eiden puts his left hand on the giant's head, making it explode into a million pieces of meat and blood that cover the floor and walls around him. As the giant's body is about to fall to the ground, Eiden uses a fire spell to incinerate it completely, leaving only ashes of the once proud warrior called Gontrok.

 "Now, then..." Eiden says, as he is using a water spell to clean his pajamas of blood. "Was there anyone else who wanted to have a duel?"

"No, I think you've made your point quite clearly, actually," says Loyrang, whose uniform is still covered in the blood of his former colleague.

"Good," Eiden says, and then he begins heading in the direction of the seredium tower as he slowly turns invisible again. "I will now be paying the king of Ollendor a short visit. If you do not arrive there too late, you might get to hear a rather interesting conversation. I trust that you still know how to find your way to the seredium tower?"

"Umm, yes," I say. "Yes, we still know the way."

"Very well," Eiden says. "In that case, I will leave the secret doors unlocked for you. I will be looking forward to seeing your next interaction with the Overseer."

"What?..." I say. "Why? What's going to happen with the Overseer?"

There is no answer. Eiden is probably already gone.

"I think Eiden must have teleported somewhere further into the tunnels," I say. "We should probably go after him. Loyrang, you said you were coming with us?"

 "Actually, I've changed my mind," Loyrang says. "From what I understood, the stillwater will be waiting for you in the tower, and to be quite honest, I would prefer to stay as far away from him as possible." 

"Yeah, I guess that's understandable," I say. "See you around, then."

"Before I go, I should probably give you one last piece of advice," Loyrang says. "If you're worried about the undetectable illusionist mage attacking you while your guard is down, you should know that he cannot use any offensive spells and that the only thing he is good at is helping his allies from the shadows by casting illusions or by using spells to temporarily daze his enemies. As long as he doesn't have anyone to work together with, he won't really be much of a threat to you. Just thought I'd let you know."

 "Alright, thanks for the heads up!"

"Goodbye and good luck!" Loyrang says.

"Same to you with whatever it is you're planning to do from now on," I say. "Be seeing you."

After we part ways with Loyrang and we begin heading for the seredium tower again, Leila writes me another message.

"Where do you suppose Loyrang went?" Leila's writing says. "We only know of one exit from these tunnels, and it's the way we're going."

"No idea," I say. "Maybe he thinks that if he'll return to the place where he was first teleported, he will get teleported back or something. Realistically speaking, unless he knows how to disarm magical traps, he'll probably wander around the caves aimlessly for a while and when he'll realize that he has nowhere else to go, he'll end up back here."

As I am walking and talking, I am continuously turning my head around in order to examine the crystals and to see if any of them are giving signs of wanting to attack us. The crystals have somewhat quieted down since Eiden has distanced himself from us, but they are still slowly vibrating, which means that Eiden has likely not left the underground corridors yet.

 "You seem to be really worried about the crystals," Leila writes to me, after she sees the way in which I am anxiously turning my head at every vibration that is slightly louder than the others. "Do you think there is any risk that they might do to us the same thing that they did to Gontrok?"

"I... don't know," I say. "They only seemed to react because Gontrok tried to harm them directly, but the last time when something like this happened, we were all attacked indiscriminately and it didn't seem to matter that some of us were just innocent bystanders."

"You are talking about the time when Arraka almost got you erased from existence while you were in the Magium's domain?" Leila writes.

 "It was more than that!" I say. "And also less. I don't know how to explain it. Normally, when you talk about not existing, you would imagine yourself simply no longer being there, but this was something else... Even though the very notion of me had been erased from the universe, there was still a part of me that was there. I'm not sure if I even knew who I was anymore, but the time I spent there in that void is something that I'll never forget. It feels like I've been floating there for a million lifetimes, but at the same time I also know that in our world it couldn't have been more than a second. The whole world kept blinking around me, and every time I went back there, it felt like I was spending an infinite amount of time in the sea of nothingness, even though I know that's impossible. It is... not an experience I would want to repeat."

The crystals have somewhat quieted down since Eiden has distanced himself from us, but they are still slowly vibrating, which means that Eiden has likely not left the underground corridors yet.

 "You seem to be really worried about the crystals," Leila writes to me, after she sees the way in which I am anxiously turning my head at every vibration that is slightly louder than the others. "Do you think there is any risk that they might do to us the same thing that they did to Gontrok?"

"I... don't know," I say. "They only seemed to react because Gontrok tried to harm them directly, but the last time when something like this happened, we were all attacked indiscriminately and it didn't seem to matter that some of us were just innocent bystanders."

"You are talking about the time when Arraka almost got you erased from existence while you were in the Magium's domain?" Leila writes.

 "It was more than that!" I say. "And also less. I don't know how to explain it. Normally, when you talk about not existing, you would imagine yourself simply no longer being there, but this was something else... Even though the very notion of me had been erased from the universe, there was still a part of me that was there. I'm not sure if I even knew who I was anymore, but the time I spent there in that void is something that I'll never forget. It feels like I've been floating there for a million lifetimes, but at the same time I also know that in our world it couldn't have been more than a second. The whole world kept blinking around me, and every time I went back there, it felt like I was spending an infinite amount of time in the sea of nothingness, even though I know that's impossible. It is... not an experience I would want to repeat."

 "Sorry, but I don't trust you one bit. For all I know, you may be secretly working with him."

"Fair enough, I suppose," Loyrang says. "In that case, feel free to ignore what I just said. I'm sure you will handle yourselves just fine either way. Goodbye and good luck!"

"Yeah, goodbye," I tell him.

After we part ways with Loyrang and we begin heading for the seredium tower again, Leila writes me another message.

"Where do you suppose Loyrang went?" Leila's writing says. "We only know of one exit from these tunnels, and it's the way we're going."

"No idea," I say. "Maybe he thinks that if he'll return to the place where he was first teleported, he will get teleported back or something.

 "I think I'm beginning to understand why even Arraka seemed a little shaken up after you came back from that place," Leila writes. "So, do you think that these crystals might in some way be connected to the Magium?"

"Yes, it's the only explanation I can think of that would make sense," I say. "Those fingers had to have been removed from existence. There was no sign of an injury on Gontrok's hand, and you saw how Loyrang and the illusionist reacted when they were asked about it. Neither of them remembered that he even had five fingers to begin with!"

"But a lot of us still remembered them," Leila writes. "The two of us did, and so did Gontrok and even Eiden. Do you think this means that the crystals failed to erase the fingers properly from everyone's minds for some reason?"

"No, my theory is that everyone in the world who knew about those fingers has forgotten about them, and that we were the exceptions," I say. "For Gontrok, it might have been too difficult to erase the notion of his fingers from his mind, because he had too many memories of them ever since his birth and removing all those memories would have resulted in his mind deteriorating beyond the point of recovery. In Eiden's case, I think he might be connected to the Magium somehow, because those crystals were clearly reacting to his presence. That would also explain why he seemed so unfazed after seeing Gontrok's fingers disappear, because it was probably something that he had already witnessed a few times before in the past."

"But what about us?" Leila writes.

 "In our case, I think it might have been because we both have lessathi blood in our veins," I say. "There was this experiment that Arraka was conducting while we were in the Magium's territory that I didn't really pay much attention to at the time, but I think it might help to explain what is happening. When we were spectating Kate's ritual in the Beacon of Hope, Arraka kept trying to get the attention of some of the lessathi that were in charge of the orphanage. When she did eventually manage to get one of them to react to what she was doing despite her being in a completely different dimension, she concluded that all lessathi must have some sort of natural affinity to the Magium, and that this is part of the reason why many of them are so good at making these devices that require you to understand magic at a very complex level. I think it is also due to this natural affinity to the Magium that we were still able to remember the existence of Gontrok's fingers. If we were to ask any of our friends about them now, I doubt any of them would be able to even imagine a Gontrok that ever had five fingers on his left hand."

 "That is... kind of scary to think about," Leila writes. "Just the thought of us having experienced a completely different reality from our friends despite being right there at their side the whole time is enough to give me goose bumps all over my skin. Right now we're only talking about two fingers on someone's hand, but I can't even begin to imagine how it would have felt trying to convince Kate or Daren of your existence if the Magium had actually succeeded in making you disappear. I might have begun to even doubt my own memories of you if I were to become the very last person in this world to remember that you even existed..."

"You're right," I say. "I haven't even considered that. Well, I guess now I have an extra reason for not wanting to be trapped in that void again. What you described right now is something that I would really not want to put you through."

"Thank you," Leila writes. "If there's any way I can help, please tell me. I wouldn't want to let you worry about these crystals all by yourself."

 After passing through a few more tunnels, we finally arrive at the secret door that we used to get into the tower when we were here previously, and as Eiden promised, the door has been left open.

"Do you think we should close the door behind us?" Leila writes, as we are entering the hidden tunnel.

"I'm not sure," I say. "If we close it, then the invisible illusionist likely won't be able to follow us anymore, but we also won't be able to retreat into the tunnels if something goes terribly wrong. I think Illuna had to direct some of her magical energy into the wall to open it when we were here the last time, and neither of us can do that. You only need to touch the wall once to close it, though, so that is something that we can do at least. Let me think about it for a second."

I nod to her and I touch the inside of the wall, which slides back into place, closing off the entrance to the secret tunnel. We then begin to climb up the stairs leading to the basement below the seredium tower.

Once we reach the top of the stairs, we go through the second door that has been left open by Eiden and we enter the same closet room full of buckets and wet rags that we stumbled into during our previous visit to the tower.

 As we are now heading into the room full of people chained up to the ceiling, I cannot help but feel the same shivers down my spine that I felt the last time I was here, despite knowing exactly what was waiting for us. I don't get a lot of time to think about this, however, because almost as soon as we exit the closet, we hear the voices of Eiden and the king of Ollendor coming from the voice magnifier tied to the transceiver that is placed in the upper corner of the room, which if I remember correctly is the device that Billy Bob was using before to make announcements to the prisoners.

"Creator, please understand that I had no intention of going against your wishes!" the king of Ollendor says. "It's just that you said you were away on important business and you gave us no way to contact you, so there was no chance for me to discuss my plans with you. I would have never even imagined that you would object to the destruction of the crystal-filled underground corridors!"

"And yet, it is clearly stated by the third golden rule that the blue crystals are not to be tampered with," Eiden says. "These golden rules have existed ever since Varathia was first founded six hundred years ago and they've been passed down from generation to generation ever since. Surely you must have heard of them?"

 "Yes, but... these rules you speak of... they are relics of the past, are they not?" the king asks, confused. "They are archaic regulations from an age when humans and animals still used to live together in harmony. Those times are long gone! I thought you would have agreed to this as well!"

"So you were well aware of these rules, but still decided to ignore them..." Eiden says. "Tell me, king of Ollendor, has it not crossed your mind that there was a reason why the fox and I considered these 'archaic regulations' important enough to build an entire civilization around them? Did you really think you could simply ignore the golden rules and there would be no consequences? No punishment for your actions?"

"Punishment?" the king asks, suddenly scared. "Creator, please, I can explain!"

 "No, I think you've already explained enough," Eiden says. "It is time for you to reap what you have sown." 

A few seconds later, we begin to hear the desperate sounds of the king trying to gasp for air while he is likely being strangled by one of Eiden's aura manipulation techniques.

"There is no use trying to call your royal guards... or what's left of them," Eiden says. "I've temporarily nullified your device's effects so that it can't teleport them anymore. You are on your own."

After a few more moments of choking sounds, we hear the king beginning to cough violently, suggesting that Eiden might have loosened his grasp on him in order to hear what he has to say.

"You..." the king says, as he is slowly regaining his voice. "Just for some blue rocks... you would do something like this? How dare you?!"

 "Just some blue rocks?..." Eiden says. "My dear king, you cannot even begin to comprehend what effects your actions from earlier today will have on this continent, and on the entire world around us. You being strangled nearly to death is something so insignificant that it simply pales in comparison to the ramifications of today's events."

"The other kings were right..." says the king of Ollendor. "You are insane! You cannot be left alive! You are far too much of a threat to us all!"

"And yet none of these kings have had the nerve to tell me this to my face, despite having been planning my assassination in secret for the past twenty years..." Eiden says. "I will commend you, though, for being the first one to actually tell me this so openly. Perhaps a small reward is in order, to show you how much I appreciate your sincerity. I will leave you now, but you should expect your reward to arrive in this very room within the next few minutes. Goodbye, king of Ollendor."

After Eiden teleports away, we hear the king coughing a few more times, and then the transceiver falls completely silent.

 "Ah, so you are the ones that the Creator sent to deliver my punishment," the king says, when he sees us enter the workshop.

"Well, that was certainly unexpected," the king of Ollendor says, in a dry tone. "Frankly, I was hoping that my defensive counter-measure would have killed you, but I also have another ace up my sleeve. Namely, your friend's father.

"I offered to free him from his cell in exchange for activating a few of my protocols that Biliborrathrathsarran always refused to give me access to, for fear of handing over too much control to me."

"You did what?!" the king shouts at Leila's father. "How? How could you have possibly considered that giving the Overseer more control is a good idea?"

"Well, you didn't exactly leave me with a lot of options," Leila's father says. "You didn't want to tell me what you did to my daughter, so I couldn't risk waiting in that cell any longer. Thank the gods that she is apparently safe."

 "Please wait..." the green-eyed drone says. "The Overseer protocol is analyzing the current situation... Analysis complete! It appears that you are trying to assassinate the king of Ollendor. Did you know that the king has a device strapped above his left knee that automatically defends him from projectiles and then shoots fire beams at his attackers? Hint: The area in the immediate vicinity of the device is not being protected properly due to Biliborrathrathsarran's faulty engineering. If you shoot your crossbow right above his left knee, you should be able to destroy the device and deactivate the king's defenses."

"You traitorous machine!" the king says, angrily. "Is this how you express your gratitude to me for allowing you to roam freely around my kingdom?!"

"Upon further analysis, it seems that the device which the king uses to call the royal guards to his location is also malfunctioning, possibly due to someone having tampered with it beforehand," the Overseer says. "If you want to kill the king, now would be the perfect time, as he will not be able to call his allies to help him."

I aim my crossbow right above the king's left knee and I pull the trigger. Just as I do this, I suddenly realize that for some unknown reason my mind had been completely fooled into thinking that I was aiming at my adversary, when in fact I was aiming at myself.

I end up shooting myself in the eye, which kills me instantly.

I aim my crossbow right above the king's left knee and I place my finger on the trigger. Just as I am about to shoot, I notice that there is something slightly off about the perspective. It's like what I am seeing in front of me is made to replicate reality, except for a few very minor discrepancies that can only be seen if you pay very close attention to them. Am I watching an illusion?

When I concentrate a little more on the angles that are not the way they should be, the illusion in front of me suddenly disappears, and I realize that instead of aiming at the king, I had in fact been aiming the crossbow at myself the whole time.

Damn, that was a close one. I almost shot myself in the eye back there. How did this even happen? Was it the work of the illusionist royal guard?

"Barry, what's wrong?" Leila writes, when she sees me staring at my weapon.

I take a good look around the room to make sure that there aren't any more discrepancies, and then I shoot the king quickly, in order to not give the illusionist any time to cast another spell. First, I shoot above his knee, like the Overseer said, and then I shoot him straight in the head.

"My king, NO!" we hear the illusionist royal guard shouting from somewhere within the room, as the king of Ollendor's dead body is now falling on the ground.

 Despite his shout, the illusionist does not say anything else, and it doesn't seem like he is keen on revealing his position to us.

After a brief pause, the Overseer breaks the silence by asking us a question.

"The king of Ollendor is now dead," the Overseer says. "You've fulfilled your original purpose for coming here. Does this mean that you will now leave, or do you still have unfinished business in my city?"

"Well, first of all, I still need to-- hold on a second, what do you mean 'your city'?" I ask him.

"As I've only just stated, the king of Ollendor is dead, and so are the majority of his royal guards," the Overseer says. "That means that this city is now under my direct control. Therefore, it is now 'my city'. Please ask me if you need any further clarifications."

 I do as the Overseer said and I shoot a crossbow bolt right above the king's left knee. Once his device is destroyed, I aim for his head and I pull the trigger. The crossbow bolt pierces the king of Ollendor's head in an instant, and his body soon falls to the ground, lifeless.

Shortly afterwards, the Overseer's green-eyed drone turns towards us to ask us a question.

"Request acknowledged," the Overseer says. "Now commencing assassination procedure. Please stand by."

"You wouldn't dare!" the king tells the Overseer, furiously.

Just as the king is done uttering his words, we hear the sound of propellers coming from the room’s main entrance, as several red-eyed drones are now entering the workshop. Before the king has any time to react, all of the drones attack him at once with both fire and lightning attacks, aiming first for the protective device above his knee and then for the rest of his body, thus killing him in a matter of seconds.

"My king, NO!" we hear the illusionist royal guard shouting from somewhere within the room, as the king of Ollendor's dead body is now falling on the ground.

Despite his shout, the illusionist does not say anything else, and it doesn't seem like he is keen on revealing his position to us. 

Having finished their job, the red-eyed drones now retreat out of the room in an orderly fashion and shortly afterwards the Overseer's green-eyed drone turns towards us to ask us a question.

"Request acknowledged," the Overseer says. "Now commencing assassination procedure. Please stand by."

"You wouldn't dare!" the king tells the Overseer, furiously.

"Well, first of all, I still need to-- hold on a second, what do you mean 'your city'?" I ask him.

"As I've only just stated, the king of Ollendor is dead, and so are the majority of his royal guards," the Overseer says. "That means that this city is now under my direct control. Therefore, it is now 'my city'. Please ask me if you need any further clarifications."

 "I thought we agreed that we would make Breynan the king and you would rule from the shadows," I say. "Are you breaking your word, by any chance?"

"The Overseer protocol is not designed to tell any outright lies," says the green-eyed drone. "The only things I am capable of doing are to withhold critical information on purpose and to mislead people through omission of important facts. Our arrangement still stands. As long as you can get Breynan to be the king, the Overseer protocol will follow his orders to the best of its ability."

As soon as I was able to kill him, I sent a few of my drones to his location and they assassinated him without any issues."

"Damn, you don't mess around, do you?" I say. "So, what exactly are you planning to do with us, then?"

 "How is it your city?" I say. "What about Billy Bob? And for that matter, how are your drones moving around so freely? I thought you had to put them into 'maintenance mode' so that the lessathi couldn't deactivate you."

"The king of Ollendor made the mistake of placing one of my drones near doctor Reidzek's cell," the Overseer says. "He thought that Biliborrathrathsarran was losing control over me, and he wanted a second opinion on how to gain better control over me and my drones. That is how I made the deal with doctor Reidzek to free him in exchange for deactivating the protocol that stopped me from killing the person who first activated me. As soon as I was able to kill Biliborrathrathsarran, I sent a few of my drones to his location and they assassinated him without any issues."

"Damn, you don't mess around, do you?" I say. "So, how come you're not attacking us, then? I thought you said that you wanted us dead when we last saw you?"

"Part of the deal I made with doctor Reidzek was to allow you safe passage to the rebel base," the Overseer says. "That is the only reason why you are still alive. However, the next time you teleport out of your underground tunnels, you should expect our interactions to be a little less pleasant."

"Understood," I say.

"Now, is there anything else I can help you with?" the Overseer says.

 "Yes, actually," I say. "Our friend Melindra told us that the king stole something from her, and I'm pretty sure that she needs this item to save her brother. Since she wanted us to kill the king and not simply sneak into the palace to steal from him, my guess is the item must be something that his ‘royal highness’ would normally bring with him at all times, but I have no idea what it could be. Any ideas?"

"Unfortunately, I cannot help you with this query, as I am not familiar with your friend's history or her motivations," the Overseer says.

"Yeah, I figured as much," I say. "I guess I'll check his pockets first, then. Or maybe it could be one of those rings on his fingers? Let me see..."

As I am searching through the dead king's pockets, the Overseer's green-eyed drone suddenly begins to act very strangely. It is constantly moving up and down, then left and right without any rhyme or reason, and it seems that its behavior is only getting worse.

"Umm, Overseer?" I say. "Are you alright there, buddy? Had a little too much to drink last night?"

"There is... a voice," the green-eyed drone blurts out all of a sudden.

"A voice?" I say.

"It is a different voice every time it speaks, but I can tell it is the same entity," the Overseer says. "It is calling out to me from a place that is beyond analysis. Beyond reason."

 As he is saying this, I can hear something vibrating loudly from within the drone. The sound it is making is eerily familiar. When I recognize what that sound is, I freeze for a moment, and then I immediately remember a conversation that Hadrik and Arraka had when we first arrived to the rebel base:

"So, if I wanted, I could just mess with the auras of some rocks, and I'd have my own personal army of highly intelligent stone golems, then?..." I remember Hadrik asking.

"Sure," Arraka answered him. "If you also combine those rocks with some seredium, and some of the blue crystals lying around these caves, and a bunch of other stuff, and then spend a few decades working on them by using the knowledge you acquired from the Magium, then yes, you'll have your army. Call me in thirty years, and tell me how that's worked out for you."

Blue crystals. These drones were all built with blue crystals inside of them. How could I forget this?

I was careless to think that we would be safe from the Magium if we reached the surface. I should not have let my guard down so easily. Maybe there's still time. Maybe if we slowly distance ourselves from the drone, we could--

"Where is the one called Arraka?" the Overseer asks us, in a voice that is completely different from his usual tone.

 "Uh, am I talking to the Magium now,or...?" I say, as I am trying to sound confident, while my whole body is shaking. "Arraka isn't here with us, right now. I don't know where she is, exactly."

"Arraka's actions have threatened the very fabric of all existence and she must be stopped at all costs," the green-eyed drone says, in the same unusual tone of voice. "You will reveal her location or this world will be undone from its seams until she is found. Starting with this room."

"Listen, we really don't know where she is, but I think you might be mistaken!" I say. "Arraka is stuck in an amulet. There is no way she could have realistically threatened anyone with doing anything more than just shouting in their ear and not letting them sleep at night! If you could give us some time, I'm sure we can quickly clear this misunderstanding and--"

"Your time is up," the green-eyed drone says, simply, and then I begin to experience a sensation that I've never felt before and that I never imagined would even be possible.

 Instead of being trapped in a void like last time, I can now feel myself existing in the earthen plane, the magical plane and the ethereal plane all at once, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. I have no idea why I am so certain that this is what's happening, since logically speaking, I have absolutely no way of knowing what the magical plane or the ethereal plane would feel like, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is indeed what I am experiencing.

Yet at the same time, I am also somehow still inside that same room, except the room looks nothing like before. The workshop is falling apart before my eyes. The objects inside the room are all flying around and it looks like there is a strong wind of some sort that is also raising me in the air at the same time. And the wind isn't just raising me in the earthen plane either, but in the other two planes as well. It feels like my very soul is being sucked out of me while my body is being thrown around the earthen and magical plane like some cosmic rag doll.

Nothing makes sense anymore. Up is down, right is left, and my consciousness feels like it' being ripped apart from all directions.

"I will be looking forward to seeing your next interaction with the Overseer," I hear Eiden's words in the back of my mind as I am being flung around across multiple dimensions.

The bastard knew. He knew something like this would happen. I'm going to kill him. I swear I will kill him.

 "Barry, grab my hand!" I suddenly hear a woman's desperate voice, as I am gradually losing my consciousness.

I immediately recognize the voice as being that of Leila, even though I've never heard her speak before and even her laughs and screams have always been silent. When I turn to her, I see that she is also being carried by the strong wind, and that she has her right hand extended towards me while she is floating in the air.

"Grab my hand, quick!" I hear her say again, but now I can clearly see that her mouth is closed while she is talking.

Am I... hearing her thoughts? Is it because we're both in the ethereal plane, which is the plane of existence where our minds reside? Does this mean that she can hear what I'm thinking now as well?

"You idiot!" I hear Leila shouting with her mouth still closed, suggesting that she did indeed hear what I was just thinking. "Stop trying to make sense of things and grab onto me already! You're getting pulled away!"

 This has to be a trick. Leila can't talk. What if it's just some illusion of Leila and when I grab her hand, I will be erased from existence again? I can't risk it.

"I am not an illusion!" Leila says with her mouth closed. "Barry, listen to me! You're running out of time! You need to grab my hand now!"

I don't listen to the illusion and I put my hands on my ears so that I will no longer hear her, even though it doesn't seem to be having much of an effect. As Leila is still calling out to me, the air currents get much stronger and I get carried further and further away from her, until I can't hear her or anything else anymore. All is now silent, and the world around me is gone. There is only emptiness. As the memory of who I once was becomes more and more blurred, I close my eyes and my consciousness slowly fades away, never to be awoken again.

 Without a second thought, I grab Leila's hand and then we both begin to spin around in the air, as the wind is trying to pull us apart.

"Don't you dare let go!" Leila says with her mouth closed.

"I won't!" I say, and we both spin around for a while longer, as our souls in the ethereal plane are holding onto each other as well.

"What the... hell?" we hear Daren's voice from somewhere beneath us, as he is now entering the room through the secret door, together with Hadrik, Kate, Flower, Illuna, Melindra and Arraka.

"What's happening?" Kate shouts to us, trying to make her voice louder than the sound of the wind and the crystal vibrations. "How can we help?"

"It's the crystal!" I say in a loud voice while Leila and I are still rotating in the air together like a slow propeller. "The blue crystal inside the drone has awoken and it said that it’s looking for Arraka. I think it’s connected to the Magium somehow. The crystal said that Arraka had threatened the very fabric of all existence and that she needs to be eliminated!"

 "What did you do this time?!" Illuna shouts at Arraka, as she grabs her amulet in her hand.

"It wasn't me!" Arraka says, in a slightly panicked voice. "It must have been the other Arraka! The one from the God of Time's trials! She's probably wreaking havoc through all the parallel universes, trying to find a way to get back to the magical plane. At least I know that's what I would have done if I were in her place!"

"So, are you planning to put a stop to this, or are you going to keep twiddling your incorporeal thumbs while this whole world gets cast into oblivion?" Illuna says loudly.

"Yes, yes, give me a minute..." Arraka says, and then we see the green-eyed drone reacting to her and getting closer to the amulet.

When the drone reaches her, it begins to shine with a bright blue light, and then without any warning, the vibration of the crystal inside it stops and the room returns to normal completely, as if nothing had even happened in the first place.

 Without having any memory of us falling down, Leila and I find ourselves lying face first on the ground, with our hands still holding onto each other for dear life. When we realize that the danger is gone, the two of us let go and we get up from the ground confused, trying to understand how everything in the room can still be intact even after all that has happened.

"...How did you get the Magium to leave us alone so quickly?" Illuna asks Arraka, as she now lets go of her amulet.

"I showed the crystal my memories of what happened with the other Arraka during Selkram's ritual, and I gave it the coordinates to her universe," Arraka says. "Judging by how quickly everything came back to normal, I'd say my intuition was right, and she was indeed the one the Magium was looking for. I'm sure that second-rate copy of me is going to have the time of her life very soon. Aha-Ahahahahaha!"

 "You should consider yourself lucky that the Magium didn't remember your hijinks through its realm and decided to end this universe as well, just to be safe," Illuna says.

"You do realize that this wasn’t the Magium itself, right? " Arraka says. "It was just a fraction of its will, manifested through the crystal, which was most likely awoken due to the destruction of the crystal-filled caverns from the rebel base. It probably didn’t even know who I was or what I did in the Magium’s realm. The only reason why it even reacted to these two losers in the first place was because it could most likely sense from their auras that they’ve been in contact with the Arraka from Selkram’s ritual, and so it must have assumed that she was hiding somewhere in this world. Anyway, the danger’s gone now, so you can relax. Everything's fine."

"I'm not exactly sure how you can tell us to relax when only a fraction of the Magium almost ended our entire world, but I suppose we can at least agree that we should be safe for now," Illuna says.

"This... is not something that I have calculated," the Overseer's green-eyed drone says out of the blue, this time in his normal tone of voice. "I will need some time to analyze what has happened. In the meantime I would like to ask you to leave this tower. We will continue our previous discussion at a later date."

"Just a moment!" Melindra says, as she goes over to the king's dead body and then she removes one of the rings from his fingers. "Alright, now we can go!"

 "Oh, so it was one of the rings after all," I tell Melindra. "I've been looking through his pockets, but I wasn't exactly sure which of the items you needed."

"I noticed," Melindra says. "And I appreciate the thoughtfulness."

"Okay, well... I certainly have a lot of questions to ask, but we should probably talk more once we're back in the rebel base," Daren says. "A lot of people got hurt during the collapse of the caves, and they need all the medical help they can get. Albert should be ready to teleport us at a moment's notice. As you might have guessed, Barry Thundercloud will not be teleporting us any longer, since he is currently being held in custody by the king of the underground's men. Are you ready to leave?"

"There is no need to be so stern, Daren!" Melindra says. "Have you already forgotten how you almost rushed to the caves under this tower by yourself when you heard from Albert that Barry was teleported here and Gontrok went after him? We still have a little time! Why don't you do what you really came here to do and give your good friend Barry a big hug?"

 "Okay, first of all, you shut up," Daren tells Melindra. "And secondly, if nobody else has anything to say, I'd like to call Albert on the transceiver now."

"Actually, I have just one short question before we go," I say. "Daren, do you remember how many fingers Gontrok had on his left hand?"

"Of course," Daren says. "He had three fingers. Why do you ask?"

"Oh, I just wanted to confirm something," I say, as Leila and I exchange a quick glance. "Don't worry about it. You can call Albert now."

"Alright, then," Daren says, as he pulls out his transceiver and he gives Albert the signal to teleport us.

"Am I going crazy, here?" doctor Reidzek asks Leila in a low voice, as we are all getting closer together, in order to get teleported. "Didn't Gontrok have five fingers on each of his hands?"

"We'll... explain later," Leila writes to him, and then a white light envelops us all, as we are all getting teleported out of the tower and back to the underground tunnels of the rebel base.
