The trapdoor above us opens up, allowing the platform to slowly lift us through the thick layer of rock making up the cave's ceiling. Once we get close to the height level of our division's cells, a second trapdoor opens up, and the platform slows down to a halt, as we finally reach our destination. Almost immediately after it stops, the elevator changes its course, and it starts to descend back towards the lower levels. We jump off the platform and onto the cell's floor, while the trapdoor closes itself back up, blocking the elevator from our view.

As I take a look around, I realize that the room we've arrived in is not in fact Leila's room, but my own. I guess it's a good thing that I chose cell number three when I was asked about it by the desk worker. If I'd chosen cell number five instead, this room would have likely been taken by the mage who got locked here yesterday. 

As we stand in the middle of my room, a small puddle is beginning to form below our feet, due to the water that is dripping from our clothes.

 "We should get changed," I say, as I take my room's key out of my pocket, and go to open the door. "I also want to take a look through my notebook, to see if I can find any useful information on the creatures we've seen in the caverns. I'll see you in a few hours, to tell you what I found."

Leila nods.

"See you later," Leila writes, and she exits my room, heading towards her own.

The first thing I do after she leaves is to search my backpack for a dry shirt and a new pair of pants.

Once we get close to the height level of our division's cells, a second trapdoor opens up, and the platform slows down to a halt, as we finally reach our destination.

We jump off the platform and onto the cell's floor, while the trapdoor closes itself back up, blocking the elevator from our view.

"W-w-what's going on?" we hear a voice coming from behind us. "How did you get here? And how in the gods' names did you get so bloody wet?"

As both Leila and I turn around, we quickly realize that the elevator did not in fact lead us back to Leila's room. Instead, it led us to cell number three, which is one of the rooms that the desk worker offered me to choose from when I first got here, and also the room that is currently being inhabited by the mage who got locked up in this place yesterday. 

 The mage is looking at us with a somewhat frightened look, while a trickle of sweat is running down his forehead, and he appears to be hiding something behind his back. 

"Sorry to bother you," I tell the mage. "We went out for a swim and we got lost on our way back. We'll be out of your hair as soon as you unlock that door for us."

"Out for a swim?" the mage asks, shocked. "You were trying to escape, weren't you? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the guards right now, and tell them what you were doing."

 "If you let us go, I won't ask anything about that thing you are hiding behind your back."

"What thing?" the mage shouts. "I'm not hiding anything behind my back!"

"It's not going to work," Leila writes, while looking directly at the mage.

"What's with the writing?" the mage asks, confused, while looking at Leila. "Is this how you talk? What's not going to work?"

Leila reaches for the floor, in order to pick up an object that looks like it was made by gluing several pieces of scrap metal together in the most random way possible. The item is small enough to fit in her palm, so she grabs it with one hand, and she stretches her arm towards the mage, bringing the metal object several inches away from his face.

"This," Leila writes. "This is what's not going to work."

"I don't know what you're talking about," the mage says, feigning ignorance. "That's just a piece of scrap metal."

 "No," Leila writes. "This is a device that's meant to enhance your physical abilities for a limited amount of time. And that thing you are hiding behind your back is likely meant to act as a bridge between you and your scrap metal device, allowing you to transfer your magical energy into it over a period of time."

"How did you--" the mage starts to say, but he stops when he sees a new text appear in front of him.

"You can't use this device in the arena," Leila writes, "It will be detected immediately. If you don't get it to somehow link itself directly to your magical aura, the magical energy that will burst from the device when you activate it will trigger all the magical detectors in a five mile radius. Either way, even if you do somehow get it to work, the device is so poorly made that you won't be able to use it for more than a few minutes, even if you spend the whole day charging it."

"A few minutes is more than enough in an arena!" the mage shouts. "A few minutes can mean the difference between life and death! You don't know how terrifying an arena can be! You have no idea! If I can get even the slightest advantage out of this device, then I will use it gladly!"

 "Don't say I didn't warn you..." Leila writes, and she hands the mage his scrap metal device.

The mage takes the device and he looks at it for a few seconds, with a contemplative expression on his face. He then pulls out a key from his pocket, and he walks past us, to unlock and then open the door.

"This meeting never took place," the mage says, as he looks towards each of us, in turn. "Do you understand? Now, go on. Get out of here."

"You don't need to tell us twice," I say, as I head out the door, and leave the room together with Leila.

As the mage closes the door behind us, the two of us start to head towards our rooms.

"I'm surprised that you could tell what that device was meant for from just one glance," I say.

"I used to spend a lot of time in my father's workshop, back when we were living in our forest cabin," Leila writes. "I learned a thing or two while watching him work."

 "Do you think he'll be able to modify the device in time for the arena?" I ask her.

"It's possible," Leila writes. "But he'll need to do it fast. He won't be able to charge it with energy while he's tinkering with it, and he'll need to charge it for at least ten hours to get any decent use out of it, given how inefficient it is."

"We should go get changed," I say. "I also want to take a look through my notebook, to see if I can find any useful information on the creatures we've seen in the caverns. I'll see you in a few hours, to tell you what I found."

Leila nods.

"See you later," Leila writes, and she heads towards her room.

I go back to my own room as well, and the first thing I do after I enter it is to search my backpack for a dry shirt and a new pair of pants.

 Once I get changed and leave my wet clothes to dry, I pick up my notebook, and I get back to studying. 

About one hour after I started reading, I got a call on my transceiver from Flower.

"Barry, are you okay?" Flower asks me out of the blue, with a bit of panic in her voice.

I could immediately tell that it was her and not Illuna speaking, from the tone of her voice.

"Yes, I'm alive," I say. "We managed to get back to our cells about an hour ago."

"Thank the gods!" Flower says. "When I heard about what happened, I got really worried. Especially when I found out that you got left alone with that jerk Fyron. Petal's been worried sick, too!"

"Oh?" I ask her, surprised. "Did she say that?"

"Well, technically," Flower says, "what she said was that if you couldn't handle yourself in a situation like that after joining this tournament, then you deserved your fate, but I'm sure that's not what she really meant!"

"I can hear you, you know..." Illuna tells me, with a menacing tone.

"Wait, do her blue eyes really make me look fat?" Flower asks.

"Hey, Barry!" Arraka says, cutting Flower off. "Something's been bothering me ever since we left the caverns. How in the hell did you manage to convince the troll to let you go? I thought for sure you were done for when I sensed him come near you."

"You mean Velgos?" I ask her. "The troll that wouldn't die even if you cut off his head? He got stopped by the arena's owner. Apparently he wants to make a show of our fight, and we'll be fighting the troll in the second round of the arena instead."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "I'll be looking forward to it!"

"Be careful, Barry!" Flower says. "We won't be able to help you while you're in the arena!"

"Yeah, I know," I say. "Don't worry, I'll be fine! But thanks for your concern."

After I got done talking to Flower and Illuna, I spent another hour studying my notebook, and then I started calling my friends from the other divisions, one by one, in order to tell them of my findings. When I got to Kate, I also decided to tell her about her old inmate from the Beacon, to see how she'd react.

 "Hey, Kate," I say. "Do you remember having met a young lessathi girl with silver hair who couldn't talk, back when you were at the Beacon of Hope? Or maybe she had black hair back then, I'm not sure."

There's a brief pause after I finish my phrase, during which I can't even hear the sound of Kate's breathing.

"How do you know about Leila?" Kate asks me, after a few seconds.

"So you do remember her!" I say. "Were the two of you on good terms, or..."

"Tell me how you know about her!" Kate shouts.

"Okay, okay!" I say. "I met her the other day. She is a member of my division. She's still alive."

There's another brief pause during which Kate doesn't say anything.

"You are certain of this?" Kate says. "How do you know it's really her? She might be trying to trick you. Anyone can dye their hair white and pretend that they're not able to speak. The Leila I know should have been dead for a long time."

"Alright, Barry," Kate says. "I'll agree to meet her. But be careful around her. You can't know for sure that it's really her. There were a lot of lessathi in that institution who knew about us. The information could have gotten out in any number of ways."

"Fine, I'll be careful," I say. "I'll see you at the arena, tomorrow. Don't be late!"

"See you tomorrow," Kate says, simply, and then we both close the transmission.

Once I make sure that every one of my friends knows about the monsters from the arena and their weaknesses, I decide that it's time to get back to Leila, in order to finally formulate a plan for how to deal with tomorrow's events. When I reach her room, I knock three times, and she opens her door, dressed in the same clothes that she was wearing when we got back from the caverns. Her clothes are not as wet as they were when we returned, but they are definitely nowhere near dry yet.

"You didn't get changed?" I ask her, shocked.

 "I don't have any change of clothes," Leila writes. "I wasn't carrying a backpack with me when I got captured."

"Well, why didn't you say something?" I say. "You could have asked me for some spare clothes until yours dried up!"

"I didn't want to be a bother," Leila writes.

"Wait a minute," I say. "If you don't have a backpack with you, then what about food? Don't tell me that you haven't eaten anything since you came here?"

"The guards have provided me with a minimum supply of food and water," Leila writes. "Just enough to get by. It's not a problem."

"Of course it's a problem," I say. "Wait here, I'm going to bring you a change of clothes and some food."

"No, you don't have to--" Leila starts to write, but I ignore her, and I go back to my room, in search for some clothes and some beef jerky from my backpack.

I then come back to Leila and I hand her a long sleeved shirt, a pair of pants, the jerky, and a bottle of water.

"Here you go," I tell Leila. "Now hurry up and get changed, will you? You wouldn't want to catch a cold right before the arena."

"Thank you..." Leila writes, as she takes what I've given her, and then closes the door, in order to get changed.

 She opens the door a bit later, dressed in my clothes, with the long sleeves of the shirt hanging past her hands, and the pants trailing on the ground, behind her.

"These clothes are... a little big for me," Leila writes.

"You look fine!" I tell her. "It's not like you'll be fighting in these clothes at the arena event. It's just until your own clothes dry off. Come on, let's go inside. I want to tell you what I found out while reading my notebook."

We both enter her room, and I spend the next fifteen minutes telling her the most important parts about my findings. She listens closely to what I have to say, while taking a bite from the beef jerky I gave her, every so often. After I'm done talking, she puts the jerky on the bed, beside her, and she starts to write.

"From what you're telling me," Leila writes, "I understand that our biggest problem by far will be the troll, and his higher than average regeneration."

"Yeah," I tell her. "It is already known that a troll can regenerate fast enough to not die from a wound to the heart, but a troll being able to survive with its head cut off is something that I didn't think was possible. I guess it goes to show how little we really know about regeneration in general. According to all the books I've read, any living being that's had its head severed from its body should not be able to live any longer, regardless of how high its regeneration is. The fact that the body could even regenerate its head contradicts our most basic knowledge about how a troll's body is supposed to work."

 "But the troll didn't regenerate his head," Leila writes. "The head kept talking from the ground, and the body had to pick it back up."

"You're right!" I say. "This means that the link between the body and the head is somehow not broken, even after the two of them get separated. Maybe we can use this. If the troll is still using its head to see and hear even after it's been severed from the body, then maybe we can cut his head off, pick it up, and then blindfold it, or something, leaving his body defenseless!"

"I don't think that the troll would leave himself open like that again, in the arena," Leila writes. "I used the element of surprise before, but now he knows how fast I am, and he won't let me cut his head off again so easily."

"Well, the only way you can kill a regular troll," I say, "is either by cutting its head off or by burning it alive. If cutting the head off is not an option, then the only alternative we have left is fire. That being said, getting access to any sort of flames will be next to impossible in the arena, and that troll is even wearing anti-magic armor, which gives him protection to fire. Even if we somehow manage to find a way to burn him, we'd first have to damage his armor badly enough that the magical protections on it would wear off."

"Do you think we should talk about all this with the other members of our division?" Leila writes. "Maybe they could come up with some ideas."

 "I suppose it couldn't hurt to hear their opinions on the matter."

Leila nods.

"Alright, then," I say. "Let's go knock on their doors, and we'll have a meet up in the recreation room."

I turn to leave the room, but Leila grabs me by the sleeve, and she stops me in my tracks. As I turn back towards her, I see that the blue writing in front of her says simply: "Wait."

The blue writing then quickly disappears, being replaced by a new text.

"Can we do this later?" Leila writes.

"Later?" I ask her, confused.

"After my clothes have dried..." Leila writes, with a pleading look in her eyes, as she shows me the long sleeves hanging from her wrists.

"Oh, right, right," I say. "Sorry, I forgot."

I pause for a few seconds.

 "On second thought," I say, "maybe we should have this discussion tomorrow, during our final recreation period. The arena events won't start until the day after tomorrow, so we'll have plenty of time to make a strategy. I don't really feel like knocking on everyone's doors as if I were trying to distribute a bunch of pamphlets. Plus, some of them might not agree to a meeting, even if I call them. I think they'll be more inclined to hear me out tomorrow, when we're all in the same room."

Leila nods again.

"I think I'm going to return to my room and try to dig up some more information," I say. "I'll search for every note that I've written regarding regeneration, and I'll try to see if I can make some sense of this situation. Maybe if we properly understand the troll's ability, we can find a way to counter it. Let me know if you come up with any ideas in the meantime."

"I will," Leila writes.

"Well, then, I guess I'm off," I say. "I'll see you again, later!"

"See you later," Leila writes, and then I leave her room and go back to my own.

As I close the door to my room behind me, and I pick up my notebook once again, my thoughts race towards the lessathi who offered me the deal with the king. I still haven't told any of my friends about it. Should I tell them about it?

 No, I definitely should not. Most of them would probably not agree with me helping the lessathi, and they'd likely get upset about it. It's better to keep this to myself. Still, I can't help but wonder who the last minute addition to our division is going to be, and just how they're planning to have him fix all my problems. Surely, they're not expecting some lessathi to take care of all those beasts by himself, do they?

 No, I shouldn't make them worry needlessly. If I am to tell them of this, then it will be after the arena, when everyone will be safe.

As I am lost in thought, while mechanically turning the pages of my notebook one by one, my eyes chance upon a paragraph that I seem to have skipped the last few times I was skimming through these texts. This paragraph mentions a theory that is not very popular among scholars, which states that the high regeneration of some creatures may be a result of an innate difference between their auras and ours. 

I suddenly remember Eiden's lecture, before we entered the city, when he was telling me that if you mess enough with a person's aura, you can even stop them from aging. If what he told me is true, then it wouldn't be that far of a stretch to assume that a special type of aura could grant someone a high regeneration rate. If that is the case, then could this aura perhaps also help in keeping the limbs functional, even if they are severed from the body? 

 I'll admit that my knowledge about auras is limited, but from the little I know, a person's aura is not supposed to have unlimited range.  What were to happen, then, if the troll's head would be taken too far away from the body after it's been cut off? Would his consciousness fade away? Would that make him die for good? If we ever manage to cut that troll's head off again, this is definitely something that's worth testing out.

I ended up spending the day trying to look for more information to confirm my theory. Unfortunately, not a lot of research has been done on this subject, since most people can barely even read the level of magic power in someone's aura, so the theory that an aura could influence a body's regeneration has been deemed as 'not grounded in facts' by most respectable groups of scholars, and the few who wanted to pursue this theory did not receive the appropriate funding to do so.

I spent my whole day researching this, and all I have to show for it is an outlandish theory, based on another outlandish theory whose validity hinges mostly on one of Eiden's offhanded remarks. Better than nothing, I guess...

I put my notebook back in my backpack, and I prepare to go to sleep. I'll have more time to study tomorrow.

 Before falling asleep, Leila came to knock on my door, in order to bring me back my clothes. I asked her if she came up with any ideas, but she said that the only thing that came to her mind was that we could try to crush the troll's head, after we behead him, in the hopes that the head will no longer regenerate after it's been cut off from the body.

The next day, our recreation period was scheduled towards noon. As I stepped out of my cell to meet the others, I noticed, to my surprise, that everyone was gathered in the middle of the room, sitting on the floor, except for Wilhelm, who was standing up, shuffling a deck of cards.

"You're late!" Wilhelm says. "Have a seat. We were almost about to start without you."

"What's going on, here?" I ask Wilhelm. 

"You are wondering," says Wilhelm, "why we are all suddenly on friendly terms after we've been mostly ignoring each other for the past few days? The answer is simple. It's because the owner of the arena just paid us a visit."

"The owner?" I ask him, surprised.

 "Yes," Wilhelm says. "He was told by the guards in this place that we haven't really been using these recreation periods to get to know each other. He therefore decided to come here personally, in order to graciously inform us that if we aren't planning to act as a team, he will be sending us one by one to our deaths, instead of giving us the chance to work together. He also let us know that today's recreation period is the last time when we can prove that we are able to cooperate with each other."

"So, that's why you're all playing cards, then?" I say.

"Well, we had to start somewhere," Wilhelm says. "And I just happened to have a deck of cards with me, so I said, why not?"

"Fair enough," I say. "So, what exactly are we playing?"

"We're playing a game of shut your mouth, and pick up the damn cards," one of the two thugs tells me, in a menacing tone.

 "If the game is called 'shut your mouth', then why are your lips moving?"

"What did you just say to me, you piece of sh--" the thug starts to say, while he gets up, but he gets interrupted by Wilhelm.

"Now, now," Wilhelm says, as he puts a hand on the thug's shoulder, in order to stop him from reaching me. "We're all supposed to act as a team here, remember?"

"Get your filthy hand off me, you lowborn scum," the thug tells Wilhelm.

I'm not sure if anyone else noticed, but for a second, there, I'm pretty sure that I could see Wilhelm's cheerful expression turn into one of pure bloodlust, as he heard the thug's words. I didn't get to see any more of his reaction, because Bruce suddenly began to laugh out loud, causing us all to turn our eyes to him, instead.

"Did you just call him a lowborn scum?" Bruce says. "And what are you supposed to be? The long lost prince of Olmnar?"

"No," says the mage that got locked up here, yesterday. "That makes him a disinherited noble. Take a good look at that filthy rag that he's wearing as a scarf. It bears the mark of the Tilirius family."

 "The Tilirius family?" Bruce says. "Hah! So, I guess that makes him a highborn scum, then. My apologies!"

He laughs again. 

"Can we please get back to our game of cards?" Wilhelm asks. "The guards are still listening."

"Nobody cares about your game of cards, Wilbert," Bruce says. "The owner said we have to talk, so we're talking. He didn't say anything about playing cards. Go do it by yourself, if you like playing cards so much."

"My name is Wilhelm, not Wilbert," Wilhelm says, in a calm but menacing tone.

 As Wilhelm stops talking, a blue writing appears in the middle of us, with large characters, so that we can all see it clearly.

"Please excuse me," the text says, "but I would like to begin discussing our strategy for tomorrow, now, if you all don't mind."

We all turn towards Leila, who is staring at us with an upset look on her face.

"Oh, uh..." Bruce says. "Of course, of course... Maybe we should start doing that."

"I could not agree more," Wilhelm says.

"And just what are we supposed to talk about, exactly?" the mage says. "We still haven't been given any information in regards to tomorrow's events. The only thing we know so far is that we're likely going to be battling mythical creatures of some kind, in one of the rounds."  

Leila gives me a look. 

I wonder if she's having second thoughts about us not telling them of what we found out in the caverns. If I were to change my mind, then there would definitely not be a better moment than this.

 "Actually there is some information that I would like to share with you," I say. "But you'd better brace yourselves, because this is going to get long."

I then start telling everyone about our trip to the underground caverns, and what we discovered there. I omitted to tell them how exactly we reached the tunnels, and I did not tell them about our encounter with Flower and Illuna either, but I tried to describe the rest of our adventure to them in as much detail as possible, while simultaneously avoiding to tell them any information that might lead them to know that we are lessathi, and that we are using stat devices. After I got done with the story, I also gave them a quick summary of what I know about each of the creatures we've met, including their behaviors and their weaknesses, and I also told them my theory about the troll's unusual regeneration ability.

"This is all very useful information," Wilhelm says. "I happened to overhear the guards last night saying that we'd be fighting a troll named Velgos in the second round, but I would have never imagined him to be so powerful. What I would like to add is that I've also heard them talk about manticores, which I don't believe you've met in the underground caverns. If your notebook has as much information in it as you've claimed, maybe you should do some research about them as well."

 "So, about that trapdoor which you triggered accidentally," Bruce says, "did you try to see if you could activate it again?"

"I've tried a few times after that," Leila writes, "but I didn't get it to work."

"Any chance we could have a look inside your room?" Bruce says. "Maybe one of us can figure it out."

"No," Leila writes. "I'm not letting either of you inside my room."

"Except for the stillwater?" the mage says.

"Except for the stillwater," Leila writes, simply.

"So our greatest problem remains the troll, then..." Wilhelm says. "I don't know what to say about that aura theory. I'm not really one to talk, because I've never studied magic, but it seems a little far-fetched to me."

"I like Leila's idea about crushing the head better," Bruce says. "I doubt he'll be able to regenerate it once it's been cut off."

"Either way," Wilhelm says, "what I think we can all agree on is that there's no way we could face these enemies alone. I know that we can't really stand each other, but we're going to have to call a truce until at least after the arena events. Our survival depends on it."

 For once, everyone agreed with Wilhelm, even if some did so more begrudgingly than others, and we decided to spend the rest of the recreation period discussing various strategies that could work against the monsters that we knew about, but also against other monsters that I've read about in my notes. We even agreed to have a second meeting later, after we'd spend some time alone in our rooms, mulling over the information that we had at our disposal.

 There's a brief pause during which nobody says anything. To our surprise, the one to break the silence was none other than the thug from the Tilirius family.

"I know a thing or two about mythical creatures," the thug says. "I've been reading about them in my free time, before they threw me out of the mansion. Harpies and manticores used to come up very often in these types of books."

"So there are advantages to being an ex-noble!" Bruce says. "Who would have thought? Well come on, don't be shy and tell us everything you know! We're going to need as much information as we can get, if we want to live through tomorrow."

"For once, I agree with Bruce," Wilhelm says. "Make sure you give us all the details you can remember. We'll also try to chip in, when we can, if we happen to remember any extra information from myths and legends that might be of help."

The rest of the recreation period was spent discussing about the creatures described by the thug, and also about various strategies that we could employ to defeat them. I didn't really get involved much in their discussion, since I can't say that I'd trust any of them to have my back during a fight. A few hours after the recreation period, I went to Leila's room so we could have our own separate strategy meeting, discussing about all the possible creatures that we may encounter, and about how we could deal with them.

 As we all walk through the dimly lit tunnels, members from other divisions are slowly beginning to walk out of their division areas as well, and follow their guides through the corridors. When we finally reach the upper levels, we are told to line up in an orderly fashion, so that the guards who were sent to escort us to the arena will have an easier time keeping an eye on us. I didn't get to see any of my friends as we advanced towards the arena, but I did see a pretty big crowd of people making its way to the arena to see the show, and a very long line at the ticket booth. 

The guards lead us through the gladiator entrance of the arena, and they show us to our locker rooms, where we get to store our belongings for the duration of the show. After we're done putting our backpacks in the lockers, the guards tell us that we're allowed to roam freely through the area designated for the gladiators until the events begin, but that we will need to gather up in the waiting area of our division after the sound of the first horn.

 I figured that this would be the best moment to arrange a meeting between Leila and Kate, so I told Leila that I wanted her to meet some of my friends before the event, and asked her to follow me. She seemed a bit suspicious of my motives at first, but in the end, she decided to come with me.

The area that we were given access to was the area right below the spectator seats, circling the area where the fighting is about to take place. The fighting area reserved for the gladiators looks much larger than those from the arenas that I've read about before, in history books. The amphitheater surrounding the arena seems big enough to host thirty thousand spectators, if not more, and yet, it does not seem that the seats are in any danger of not being filled. Even at this early hour in the morning, there are thousands of spectators pouring in through all the entrances, and then making their way through the rising tiers of seats, eager to reach their reserved spots, and to watch the event of the century. 

It seems that three days were more than enough to spread the word throughout the city about today's event.  We make our way through the lower level of the coliseum, while I look around, scanning the groups of gladiators to see if I can spot anyone I know. 

 Half an hour later, we are still nowhere close to finding any trace of them. I tried reaching them through Daren's transceiver as well, but I've had no luck. There must be too many people trying to use transceivers in the area to be able to lock onto the correct signals. Where could they all be? The horn that announces the start of the events could be sounding any minute now.

"Leila?" I hear Kate's voice behind me. "Leila, is that really you?"

Leila turns around, at the sound of Kate's voice, but when she sees her face, she appears frozen by shock.

"Kate?..." Leila writes, but she doesn't have the time to write anything else, because Kate comes rushing towards her, and then she hugs her as tightly as she can.

Even at this early hour in the morning, there are thousands of spectators pouring in through all the entrances, and then making their way through the rising tiers of seats, eager to reach their reserved spots, and to watch the event of the century. 

It seems that three days were more than enough to spread the word throughout the city about today's event.  We make our way through the lower level of the coliseum, while I look around, scanning the groups of gladiators to see if I can spot anyone I know. 

 Half an hour later, we are still nowhere close to finding any trace of them. I tried reaching them through Daren's transceiver as well, but I've had no luck. There must be too many people trying to use transceivers in the area to be able to lock onto the correct signals. Where could they all be? The horn that announces the start of the events could be sounding any minute now.

"Leila?" I hear Kate's voice behind me. "Leila, is that really you?"

Leila turns around, at the sound of Kate's voice, but when she sees her face, she hesitates to write anything, for a few moments.

"Kate, I..." Leila starts to write, but she gets interrupted by Kate rushing towards her, and hugging her as tightly as she can.

 "Leila!" Kate says. "By the gods, I thought you were dead. They told us you died from the experiments. Oh gods, Leila, I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have believed them! I should have gone looking for you like I did for all the others."

"You don't need to apolo--" Leila writes, but she stops her text when she realizes that Kate is currently keeping her eyes closed, in an attempt to keep the tears from flowing out.

"I'm sorry," Kate says. "I shouldn't have abandoned you like this. Please forgive me! I was so focused on Diane that I--"

The rest of Kate's words get drowned out by the sound of a very loud horn. It seems that the arena event is about to start. 

"Kate, we need to go," Daren says.

I only now notice that Daren and Hadrik were also there, standing behind Kate. They must have all met earlier, and came looking for me together.

"I know," Kate says, as she wipes her tears with her sleeve.

"Please... keep her safe..." Kate tells me, simply, as she walks past me, heading towards her division's side of the arena.

"I will," I tell her.

"Kate, wait, I..." Leila writes, with her mouth open, as if she'd forgotten that she can't talk, but Kate doesn't get to see the blue writing, and she keeps walking away from us.

 "Hey, Kate!" I shout loudly, to make sure that she hears me.

Kate stops in her tracks, and she turns around, confused. Seeing that Leila doesn't do anything, I give her a nudge with my elbow. She finally understands what I was doing, and she quickly makes a message out of blue text, with very large letters, so that Kate can see them from a distance.

"Kate, I'm sorry too," the text says. "I'm sorry for having thought that you would never want to see me again because I was a lessathi!  So, now that we're both sorry, let's win the arena and get out of here alive so we can continue being sorry together!"

At first, Kate had a bit of a shock when she saw the writing, but then she realized who it was coming from, and she managed to smile.

"It's a promise!" she shouts at Leila, and then she turns around, to hurry back towards her division.

 "Knock 'em dead, Barry!" Hadrik says, with his usual grin, as he also heads towards his own designated area.

"Or better yet, don't get killed," Daren tells me. "We only need to survive the arena, not win it. I'll see you again after the end of the event. Remember, no need to do anything crazy. Just stay alive. Got it?"

"Got it," I say.

Once Daren is also gone, Leila and I decide to head towards our division as well. 

"So..." I say, as the two of us walk side by side. "Now are you glad that you decided to follow me to meet my friends?" I say.

Leila looks at me surprised for a few moments, until she realizes that it was in fact Kate that I wanted her to meet from the very beginning.

 Once I'm done with my stat device, I put it back in my pocket, and I see that Leila is just about done with hers as well. Knowing her, she must have placed all her points in toughness. I would ask her directly, but I wouldn't want to give away to the others the fact that we are lessathi.

"Found a way to send messages in private, have you?" Bruce asks us, after seeing us both use the same type of devices at the same time. "Well, I hope you've said what you needed, because the show's almost about to start."

Shortly after Bruce is done talking, we hear the sound of a second horn, now signaling the actual beginning of the event. The few spectators who came in late are now hurrying as fast as they can towards their seats, as the announcer is doing a few tests, to make sure that his voice magnifier is working properly. Soon, the constant murmur that could be heard throughout the arena slowly dies out, and the announcer takes a deep breath, preparing to officially announce the beginning of the arena event.

"Welcome," the announcer says. "Welcome to all! I don't think that there is any reason for me to make a lengthy introduction this time around. You all know why you're here. You came here because you were promised the event of the century, and we plan to deliver on that promise. Now, if it's alright with everyone, I would like to begin by announcing the rules."

The announcer waits for a few moments, in order to make sure that there are no objections, and then he continues to read from his notepad.

 "By the request of the arena's owner himself, mister Venard," the announcer says, "today's event will follow the traditional rules, which had been used by his father before him and by the lessathi of old, before the still winter. As most of you may already know, this also means that if a gladiator breaks one of the rules, they will not be disqualified from participating any further, but they will become an undesirable. By becoming an undesirable, a gladiator will be forced to participate in an additional round after the official event ends, where they will need to fight all of the other remaining gladiators at once, in one final battle. Any gladiator who manages to give the finishing blow to an undesirable will get rewarded either with his freedom, or with a large sum of money, depending on their status in this arena. Other gladiators can of course refuse to participate in this final round, and undesirables can also choose to no longer participate in the regular rounds, once they have been pegged as rule breakers."

 The announcer coughs loudly, and he flips the page of his notepad.

"Of course," the announcer continues, "this does not mean that gladiators will now be exempt from following the general rules of the arena. If a gladiator is caught using magic, if they try to kill their teammates, or if they attack any of the spectators, they will be executed on the spot. The undesirable rule only applies for the rules of the actual event. Moving on, the traditional rules of the arena state that the arena events must be divided into exactly three rounds. The first round, as I'm sure you've already been told, will be fought against a variety of mythical creatures that have never been used before in this arena. We do have a surprise for the second round, however. For this special occasion, instead of our reigning champion, I think you will be happy to learn that the warrior who will be joining us is none other than the relentless mercenary Velgos!"

There is a loud murmur in the crowd when they hear the name of Velgos. From what I can tell, they seem excited about the prospect of watching him fight.

"In the third round," the announcer says, "the gladiators that survived the first two rounds will need to fight in a series of duels, to decide who will be the victors of this event. Some of the duels will have to be fought to the death, while others will be fought only until one of the fighters surrenders. The exact duels will be decided after the end of round two, when we will know exactly which of the fighters have survived. And now that we got all of the introductions out of the way, I believe it is finally time to get this event started. Is everyone ready?"

 The crowd bursts into loud cheers for a few seconds, and the announcer now raises his voice, in order to drown out all the loud noises.

"Then I will keep you waiting no longer," the announcer says. "Let the event of the century commence!"

One of the iron gates from the lower level of the amphitheater is now slowly getting raised, while the crowds keep cheering as loud as they can.

"For the first round," the announcer says, "divisions of fighters will be entering the arena one by one, in the order of their division's number. Let us give a warm round of applause to this event's first division!"

 There is a mixed sound of applause and shouts coming from the spectator seats, as the gladiators from the first division make their way out of the gates, and towards the center of the arena. I do not recognize any of the warriors in this division, but judging by the continued cheers of the crowd, I'd say that most of the spectators have seen them perform at least once before. Some of the gladiators seem a little bit too confident. Former victors, perhaps? Either way, they'd better get their act together, and quick. From what Bruce said on my first day here, the events until now could not even begin to compare with what's coming. 

A large iron gate on the opposite side of the arena makes a loud creaking noise as it opens. From beyond the gate, a lion with black wings, red eyes, two horns on its head and a scorpion's tail is making its way into the fighting area. The manticore wastes no time, and it soars directly into the sky. Two more manticores follow its lead, and they all start circling the skies above the arena, watching their prey intently. Seeing the beasts leave the fighting area with such ease, some of the spectators in the crowd are beginning to show signs of uneasiness.

"Do not worry," the announcer says, trying to calm down the crowd. "These beasts have been well trained. They would not dare to lay their claws on anyone other than the gladiators in the arena."

Several giant scorpions are now also joining the arena, coming from beyond the same gate that the manticores entered from. They are slowly advancing towards the warriors, in a straight line, without any attempt to surround them.

I leave the area of our division and hurry towards the locker rooms. Shortly after I exit the room, one of the guards sees me and he calls after me.

"You there," the guard says. "Why did you leave the area of your division?"

"I'm sorry," I say. "I forgot something in my backpack and I was heading towards the locker room."

"You're not supposed to leave your designated area without permission," the guard tells me.

"Okay," I say. "How do I ask for permission, then?"

 The guard scratches his head. I don't think anyone's ever asked him this question before.

"Wait here," the guard says. "I'll go ask the owner. You'd better not move from this spot till I come back, or you'll be in trouble."

The guard goes to climb a flight of stairs, and then he disappears from my sight. He returns a few minutes later, with a paper in his hand.

"Here is a free pass, signed by the owner," the guard says, as he hands me the piece of paper. "If any other guards try to stop you, you show them this paper. When you're done, you come back here, and you hand this paper to me. Is that clear?"

"Crystal," I say, and then I head towards the locker room.

When I finally reach my locker, I open it with my key, and then I get the notebook out of my backpack. I quickly rip out the pages I need, then I place my notebook back in my backpack and I close the locker.

 As I study the information on my way back from the locker room, I realize that the desert marauders were indeed not much different from giant scorpions. Even their weaknesses are the same. I guess this whole trip was nothing but a huge waste of time.

When I get close to my division area, I notice the guard waiting for me where I left him, and I hand him back his paper.

I then re-enter the area designated for my division, and I go back towards the iron grating, where everyone is watching the fights.

It seems that both the first and the second division fights have already ended. All of the manticores and the scorpions are dead, and there are also some archer porcupine corpses lying on the ground beside them. Hadrik is now being thrown up and down by his teammates, while they are repeatedly chanting his name, and the crowds are cheering at the top of their lungs.

She then points towards several dead gladiators that are hidden behind some marauder carcasses.

"Damn..." I say. "We'd better get ourselves ready, then. It will be our turn after the next division."

It takes about another minute for the cheering to finally die down, and for Hadrik and the others to step off the stage, so that the next division can enter the fighting area.

 Forget the notebook. For all I know, they might not even use the marauders for our division, and I'd just be wasting time.

The marauders are now getting closer and closer to the gladiators, while the manticores are still flying in circles, waiting for the best opportunity to strike.  

The warriors seem to be rather well organized, and they're not letting the monsters intimidate them. On their leader's signal, three of the men jump to attack the left-most marauder, while the rest of the gladiators try to distract the others. One of the warriors remains behind, and he watches the manticores attentively. He must have been tasked to observe the battlefield, so that he can warn his teammates if the situation changes.

The scorpion-like creatures are at least five times bigger than the gladiators, and they could probably crush any single one of them in their giant claws. The warriors seem to be experienced in battle, however, and they manage to remain unharmed, by anticipating the marauders' movements, and by covering for each other in their time of need. The group from the left in particular seems to be doing surprisingly well. They've managed to weaken the creature with a few well-timed strikes, and they're already moving in for the kill. 

The most agile of the three jumps on the creature's back and he stabs it fiercely in the back of its head. The marauder screams in pain and it tries to attack the warrior with its tail, but the gladiator jumps off, while the other two make a rush for it and stab the monster in both its eyes with their swords, at the same time.

 "Hey, Leila," I say. "Can I ask you a favor?"

Leila turns towards me, with a curious look in her eyes, waiting to see what I have to say.

"There was some information written about desert marauders in my notebook," I say, "but I don't remember some important details. Could you please go get the notebook out of my backpack, rip the pages about the marauders out and bring them to me? There's an index at the beginning of the notebook where you can find the numbers of the pages you're looking for. I'd go myself, but I'm the one who's studied about mythical creatures the most, and I'm afraid that I'll miss something important if I don't watch the fights."

"Okay, I'll go," Leila writes. "Give me the key."

I take the key of my locker out of my pocket, and I hand it to Leila.

"The number of the locker is written on the key," I say. "You've seen what my notebook looks like, right? You'll need to have a clear image of it in your head if you want to retrieve it from the backpack."

"Yes, I've seen it," Leila writes. "I'll be right back."

She then leaves the area of our division and heads towards the locker room.

While I'd been talking with Leila, the marauders had gotten closer to the gladiators. The manticores are still flying in circles, waiting for the best opportunity to strike.  

 The warriors seem to be rather well organized, and they're not letting the monsters intimidate them. On their leader's signal, three of the men jump to attack the left-most marauder, while the rest of the gladiators try to distract the others. One of the warriors remains behind, and he watches the manticores attentively. He must have been tasked to observe the battlefield, so that he can warn his teammates if the situation changes.

The scorpion-like creatures are at least five times bigger than the gladiators, and they could probably crush any single one of them in their giant claws. The warriors seem to be experienced in battle, however, and they manage to remain unharmed, by anticipating the marauders' movements, and by covering for each other in their time of need. The group from the left in particular seems to be doing surprisingly well. They've managed to weaken the creature with a few well-timed strikes, and they're already moving in for the kill. 

The most agile of the three jumps on the creature's back and he stabs it fiercely in the back of its head. The marauder screams in pain and it tries to attack the warrior with its tail, but the gladiator jumps off, while the other two make a rush for it and stab the monster in both its eyes with their swords, at the same time.

 The crowd bursts into loud cheers and shouts, as the scorpion-like creature falls to the ground. The three warriors raise their swords for a few seconds, to signal their victory to the spectators, and then they head towards the other marauders, in order to help their team mates.

"Fall back!" we hear the desperate shout of the gladiator who was observing the battlefield. "Fall back, now!"

The gladiators look up, but they have no time to react. It takes only a few seconds for the manticores that had been circling the skies all this time to dive down, to sink their claws into the warriors' chests, and then to soar back into the air, carrying their prey. 

The screams of the gladiators silence the crowd completely, as the beasts fly higher and higher. Two of the gladiators dropped their swords from the pain, immediately after being attacked, but one of them managed to keep hold of his weapon, and he's now using it to stab his attacker in the underbelly. The manticore screams, and it drops the warrior, who falls to the ground and crushes his head against the hard soil. The other two gladiators are raised a bit higher by their attackers, but then they also get dropped to the ground, and they die on impact.

The remaining warriors are now finally starting to panic. Their leader was among the ones who died. Having lost the person who was giving them directions, the gladiators begin to break their formation, and the marauders take advantage of this by grabbing one of the warriors with their claws, while another marauder impales him with its tail. 

 As if all this wasn't enough, two more manticores are just now entering the fighting area from beyond the gate, and they're running fast towards the surviving gladiators. The observer gets killed first. He didn't seem to be very skilled in combat, and he got mauled in an instant. The other gladiators did not last much longer. The desert marauders and the manticores finally joined forces against them, and they couldn't stand a chance. 

At the end of the fight, the arena falls completely silent, except for the sounds of the manticores, feasting greedily from the carcasses of their hard earned prey.

"By the gods..." Bruce says, as he watches the battle's aftermath in horror, from beyond our iron grating.

"It appears that not even our reigning champions could defeat these fearsome beasts," the announcer says. "This does not look good for the following divisions. Is this event going to end in a bloodbath?"

The iron gate for the second division is now getting raised. However, nobody seems to be coming out. After about ten seconds of silence, we hear a scream coming from their direction.

"I'm not going out there!" a man screams, at the top of his lungs. "If you want to kill me, then kill me now! You saw what happened to those gladiators! We don't stand a chance!"

"You're going to march in there and fight," another man's voice says, "or you'll be getting a death far worse than being eaten alive by a manticore."

"No, please, have mercy!" the other man shouts.

 The discussion between what I presume is a gladiator from the second division and a guard of the arena is getting a lot of reactions from the spectators. Some of them seem to be getting scared, and others are fidgeting around nervously in their seats.

"We seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties," the announcer says. "There's no need to be alarmed. I'm certain that our guards will get the show up and running again in--"

The announcer stops mid-sentence, as a single dwarf steps out of the second division's gate, carrying a bottle in his hand, and walking at a relaxed pace, towards the desert marauders. Both the crowd and the announcer fall completely silent, as they watch Hadrik walk calmly, and then stop in the middle of the arena, in order to chug down the last contents of his bottle.

"Ah!" Hadrik exclaims. "There's nothing like a fine bottle of dwarven ale to raise your appetite before a battle!"

He then starts turning his head around, as if he were looking for something. 

"Say, you wouldn't happen to have something that I could throw this empty bottle away in, would you?" he shouts towards the announcer, as he shows him the empty bottle in his hand.

The announcer watches him, with a puzzled expression on his face, without saying anything.

 "You know, like a trash can, or a paper bag, or something, so I don't make a mess?" Hadrik says.

The announcer and the crowd watch the dwarf silently, unable to decide whether he is being serious or not. While Hadrik was talking, one of the scorpion-like creatures was slowly creeping up behind him, and aiming to attack him with its claws.

"You know what, never mind!" Hadrik says. "I'll just use this as an improvised weapon, instead."

He then immediately turns around, and he clobbers the desert marauder in the head with his bottle, which breaks into shards of glass that stab the creature in its eyes. The monster starts screaming in pain, as Hadrik makes a quick jump, landing with his fist on top of the marauder, and smashing it against the ground, causing a loud shockwave while also forming a small crater below the creature, due to the force of the impact. 

One of the manticores that was still up in the sky quickly dives down to grab Hadrik in its claws, but the dwarf steps away at the exact moment when the monster reaches him, and he grabs it by the tail. He then spins it around for about four seconds, building momentum, and then he throws it at a wall far away from him with all his might, causing the beast to smash right through it with a loud booming noise.

The crowd and the announcer are both speechless. They are looking at the dwarf with bemused expressions on their faces, not knowing how to react.

 "Oh, you don't need to worry about that wall," Hadrik says, thinking that his reckless behavior is the reason for everyone's silence. "I checked that area out before the battle and there's nothing but an empty storage on that side, so there's no danger of anyone getting hur--"

A loud roar of cheering noises drowns out the rest of Hadrik's words, as the spectators finally regain their previous vigor, and start shouting and clapping like never before.

"See, now that's more like it!" Hadrik shouts, with a wide grin, as he sees the people cheering. "This is what an arena is all about! You all better hang on to your seats, because the fun is just starting!"

He then runs towards another marauder, and he headbutts it so fiercely that it drops to the ground in an instant.

"Release the second wave!" the announcer shouts, as a few more desert marauders come out of the large iron gates that had been opened previously.

 Making their way from behind the marauders, a new species of creatures is now entering the fighting area. The creatures look like larger versions of porcupines, but from what I understand they should not be related to them in any way besides their looks. Unlike regular porcupines, the quills on their backs are deadly weapons, and they are sharp and durable enough to give elven steel a run for its money. The creatures have the ability to launch their quills as projectiles, with a very high accuracy and speed. Due to their high regeneration rate, they also have the ability to regrow their quills almost instantly. This provides them with a near unlimited stock of ammunition to use against their foes. Their appearance and their behavior have led people to call these creatures 'archer porcupines'.

A few of the porcupines that have positioned themselves several dozen feet behind Hadrik are now turning their backs towards him, getting ready to attack. Hadrik is still fighting the marauders, and he doesn't seem to have noticed the porcupines. Should I shout a warning to him? I wouldn't want to distract him in the middle of his battle, but if those porcupines manage to aim their shots right, he might be in trouble.

 "Hey, Hadrik!" I shout. "Behind you!"

Hadrik looks back, and he sees the porcupines getting ready to attack him. He waits for them to shoot, and he dodges at the last moment, causing the quills to hit a desert marauder instead. He then dashes towards his ranged attackers, not leaving them any time to ready up a second shot, and he pummels them repeatedly with his fists, until they're all either dead, or unable to move. 

"Nice one, Barry!" Hadrik then says. "I owe you a beer."

The marauder who got hit by the quills was the last one standing, and the damage it took was enough to send it falling down.

The manticores have all abandoned their meals when Hadrik started his rampage, and they're now back to circling the skies, trying to find the right time to strike. One of the braver manticores dives down quickly, in an attempt to surprise the dwarf, but when it sees him react, the monster quickly soars back up into the sky, and out of his reach.

"Damn it!" Hadrik says. "Come back here, you coward! Come back here and fight!"

"Hey, dwarf!" I hear Arraka's voice coming from the crowd. "Why don't you try singing them a lullaby? Maybe they'll get sleepy and come back down. AHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

 Following the sound of Arraka's voice, I manage to identify Flower in the crowd of spectators. The people around her all have their heads turned towards her, and are watching her curiously. They must think that the amulet around her neck is some new type of transceiver.

"Shut up, you blasted old hag!" Hadrik shouts back at her. "When I get out of here, I swear I'm going to double your spinning sessions!"

"Yeah, I've got a better idea!" Arraka says. "How about you stop wasting everyone's time and get back to fighting? Do you have any idea how much this ticket cost?"

"I can't fight them, you moron!" Hadrik shouts, exasperated. "I'm not allowed to use ranged weapons in the arena."

"Then throw some spears!" Arraka shouts. "Do I really have to tell you everything? You've got spears mounted on the walls. Use them."

Now that Arraka mentions it, I see that there are indeed spears and various other weapons mounted on the walls of the arena. They must have been placed there to give people who didn't have any weapons when they got captured an equal chance in the fighting event. Hadrik mumbles something under his breath, and he goes to get one of the spears. He then tosses it at one of the manticores, and the spear lodges itself into its chest, causing blood to spray out while the creature falls towards the ground. Before the creature reaches the soil, the dwarf grabs two more spears, and he throws them in quick succession towards two of the other manticores, killing them as well.

 I shouldn't interrupt his fight. He knows what he's doing.

While Hadrik sends the last of the marauders crashing to the ground, three of the archer porcupines aim their shots towards him, and six of their sharp quills stick themselves into the dwarf's back.

"Huh," Hadrik says, with the tone of a man who's just been bitten by a mosquito.

He then takes all of the quills out one by one with his hands and he throws them on the ground. The quills seem to have barely gotten through his skin, and there is hardly any blood coming out of the wounds. I don't know why I'm surprised. If regular unenchanted elven steel is not sharp enough to pass through a giant's skin, then why would it be any different for porcupine quills?

Hadrik does not give the archer porcupines the chance to aim their second shot, as he dashes towards them, and then pummels them repeatedly with his fists until they're all either dead, or unable to move.

The last remaining manticore decides that the skies are no longer safe, so it quickly dives down towards Hadrik, to end the fight with one big final clash. Hadrik does not wait for the creature to reach him, and he makes a jump, grabbing it from the air, and doing a spinning drop, crushing the beast's head into the ground.

He did it... The crazy bastard did it. He took both waves of monsters down all by himself, and he barely even got scratched.

The crowds are now cheering louder than ever before. Hadrik's teammates, who had been hiding this whole time, come running towards the dwarf, and they raise him in the air, while chanting his name repeatedly.

"Hadrik! Hadrik! Hadrik!" they keep saying, while the crowds are all cheering. 

"Don't think that you're getting off that easy, you cowardly dogs," Hadrik says, with a grin, while his teammates are throwing him up and down. "When we get out of here, you're going to buy me a year's worth of drinks."

"What is the meaning of this?!" I hear the ambassador of Ollendor shout from above.

"Ambassador!" says Venard, the owner of the arena. "I see that you've decided to join us after all! Would you like some wine?"

The two of them seem to be talking from a private room above our division's area. It doesn't appear like any of my teammates are able to hear them.

 "Why is the dwarf here?" the ambassador says. "He wasn't supposed to be here! He's going to ruin everything!"

"Calm down, ambassador," Venard says. "The dwarf came here with a letter of admission signed by the king himself. We couldn't just turn him down."

"Just because you couldn't turn him down," the ambassador says, "it doesn't mean that you have to let him make a mockery of your entire arena!"

"But he hasn't done that at all, ambassador," the owner says. "Quite the contrary, in fact. He has provided us with a spectacle that this arena has not seen for ages, and the crowds love it. The show has only just started, and it's already exceeded all of my expectations!"

"I don't care about your expectations!" the ambassador shouts. "I want him out, do you understand? I do not want him to set foot in that arena ever again!"

"Hmm," Venard says. "Truth be told, I also think that allowing the dwarf to wreak havoc any longer than he already has would make the show too predictable and boring. Very well, ambassador. I will speak with the staff in charge of arranging the fights to make some modifications in the schedule. You will not be seeing him again."

After they've finished their discussion, the room above falls silent again. Meanwhile, on the outside, the crowds have still not stopped cheering, since the end of the previous fight. It takes about another minute for the cheering to finally die down, and for Hadrik and the others to step off the stage, so that the next division can enter the fighting area.

 The gate to the third division is now opening. The first one to come out of it is none other than Daren. His teammates also follow him after a short period of time, but they are looking a bit apprehensive.

"For your information," the announcer says, "the man with the scar who just entered the arena is known as Daren, the healer in armor. He is a well-known hero from outside of Varathia who has travelled the world and has saved countless lives throughout the years. You may have heard of him from various newspapers in the past. Today, he will be participating in our arena event as our special guest. Let us have a warm round of applause for the hero Daren!"

All of the spectators begin clapping, as Daren and his teammates get closer to the center of the arena and ready their weapons.

"Okay, listen up!" Bruce tells us, while the gladiators are still waiting to begin their fight. "After watching the two fights from before, I think that we need to change our battle strategy."

"Have you gone daft?" the disinherited noble thug says. "Why would we change our tactics a few minutes before the battle?"

 "Because the way we are now, we're going to lose," Bruce says. "We don't have any teamwork. We should try being more like those gladiators in the first division. You saw how well they worked together."

"The gladiators from the first division are all dead," the mage says.

"Damn it, you know what I mean!" Bruce says. "I'm talking about assigning roles to everyone. You all saw how they operated. One guy was the leader, another one was staying behind, to warn them of danger, some of them were decoys, and others were the main fighters. If we did that too, we'd be a lot more organized."

 "I think that's a good idea," I say. "If we each have a role, and we know what we're doing, there will be less chance of panic."

"Oh yeah?" the mage asks. "That's probably what those guys from the first fight thought too. But when their leader died, all of their organization went down the drain."

"It's still better than fighting in complete chaos from the very beginning!" Bruce says.

"And who exactly is going to be our leader?" the disinherited thug asks Bruce. "You? Don't make me laugh. I'd rather get eaten by a manticore than have to listen to any of your orders."

"I never said that I would be leader," Bruce says. "We can vote on who gets to be leader."

"Forget it," the mage says. "I don't care who the leader is. I'm not leaving my survival in the hands of a person that I barely even know. It's not going to happen."

While Bruce and the others were fighting, the third division's first round was getting ready to start.

"Release the tramplers!" the announcer says.

 Several creatures that look like a cross-breed between a bull and a rhinocerus are now slowly entering the fighting area. Each trampler has two horns on its forehead, one horn on its snout, and a tail that looks like it has a spiked mace attached to the end. I've also read that their skin is so tough that they may as well be wearing full plate armor. As their name suggests, tramplers will usually engage in battle by rushing towards their opponents, and attempting to trample them to their deaths.

Sure enough, the tramplers do not wait for long, and they start rushing towards the gladiators at full speed.

"If you want to live, stay behind me," Daren tells the other gladiators.

Daren's teammates are looking terrified. It only takes them a few seconds of watching the beasts get closer and closer for them to completely forget Daren's warning and to start running for their lives.

Daren lets out a deep sigh, and he continues to stand his ground, with his sword at the ready. As soon as one of the tramplers comes within reach of his blade, he steps to the side, and he cuts off the beast's head in one single motion, causing the trampler's headless body to fall on the ground and to keep sliding forward on its belly for a few more feet, until its momentum is finally gone.

 "Gods be damned," I hear Bruce shout behind me. "Why won't you listen to me? We're not going to stand a chance in the arena if we don't get our act together!"

"You don't need to be so negative, Bruce," Wilhelm says, with a calm tone. "I'm sure that we'll handle ourselves one way or another. The important thing is that we had that discussion yesterday about the creatures' weaknesses. As long as survival is the primary goal in all of our minds, we'll surely put that information to the best of uses."

 The tramplers have finished their first tour of the arena, and they're now coming back towards Daren for a second round. Some of his teammates have managed to evade the stampede, but two of them were not so lucky, and they got trampled to death before they could get out of harm's way. Daren waits patiently until the last moment yet again, and then he runs his blade through the side of the creature, slicing it in half. The crowds are going wild once more.

Seeing that the first wave of beasts is already being dealt with, the announcer signals the beginning of the second wave. Three giant cobras are now making their way towards Daren, while the tramplers decide to try chasing some of the easier prey. The cobras are both taller and wider than Daren, but their size is not the only dangerous thing about them. By the looks of the black spots on their necks, I'm almost certain that these are in fact acid-spitting cobras, and not regular ones. 

Acid that comes from cobras is not as strong as the acid from mage spells, but it's definitely not something to be sneezed at. While it may not significantly damage weapons and armor that have been sufficiently enchanted, the acid from a cobra can still burn through most regular metals in a matter of minutes, and it can burn through human flesh in a matter of seconds.

#if(v_b2_ch4_inform2 == 0 && v_b2_ch4_inform3 == 0) {
 Being now faced with ranged attackers, Daren decides that it is no longer safe to maintain his position, and he switches to the offensive. Advancing slowly, with his shield in front, Daren gradually closes the gap between himself and the cobras, until he gets near enough to be able to make a dash attack. The cobras have been spitting at him all this time, but judging by the impact it's had on Daren's shield, they may as well have been spraying water.

Daren makes a dash towards one of the cobras, and he slices its head off in one strike. Before the other two get to attack him, he bashes one with his shield, while stabbing the other through the mouth with his sword. He then makes sure that the third cobra is still dizzy, and he finishes it off as well, with one well-timed slash of his blade.

While Daren was busy with the cobras, the other gladiators had somehow managed to bring down one of the tramplers by themselves. Seeing that the other tramplers are not planning to attack him anymore, Daren decides to go help the others kill off the remaining creatures.

"If none of you are going to listen to reason, then I'll fight on my own!" Bruce shouts again, this time louder than before. "I don't plan on getting killed to save your sorry behinds!"

"I very much doubt that anyone was counting on your help to begin with," Wilhelm says. "Now could you please keep quiet? Our battle will begin shortly, and I would like to concentrate."

Great. Our fight didn't even start yet, and our team is already falling apart. I knew from the beginning that these people couldn't be trusted.

 Being now faced with ranged attackers, Daren decides that it is no longer safe to maintain his position, and he switches to the offensive. Advancing slowly, with his shield in front, Daren gradually closes the gap between himself and the cobras, until he gets near enough to be able to make a dash attack. The cobras have been spitting at him all this time, but judging by the impact it's had on Daren's shield, they may as well have been spraying water.

 There is a very loud burst of cheering coming from the outside. It appears that Daren and the other surviving gladiators have finally defeated all of the creatures. The announcer is signaling them to leave the fighting area, so that the show can proceed. 

As Daren and the others are getting ready to leave, a man dressed in a dark blue robe with a hood on his head comes from behind me, and he joins my side by the iron grating.

"Who are you?" I ask him, even though I can probably already guess the answer.

"I am a last minute addition to your division," the man says. "I've been sent here to solve your troubles."

The man is carrying two scythes in his hands, that both have sapphires encrusted into their hilts.

"You were sent here by the lessathi?" I ask him in a low voice, in order to make sure that none of the others hear me. "What were they thinking? Don't tell me that you plan to fight all of the monsters by yourself?"

"I will uphold our end of the bargain," the lessathi says. "Make sure that you uphold yours when the time comes."

"Uh, yes," I say. "Yes, of course..."

The lessathi suddenly turns his head towards me, with an expression of shock and rage in his eyes.

"You are lying!" he says.

"What?" I ask him. "No, I was telling the truth!"

 "You are a fool!" the lessathi shouts. "Any person with passable skills in reading auras could tell that you are lying from the way your aura is trembling right now. Don't you have any idea what happens to people that lie to us? I should kill you right now for your insolence."

"Hey, what's going on, here?" Bruce asks, after hearing the lessathi's shouts. "Who are you, and what are you doing in our division?"

The lessathi calms down, and he puts his scythes away when he sees Bruce confront him. It seems that despite his earlier remark, he would rather avoid a conflict that would draw too much attention to himself.

"The deal is off," the lessathi says, as he heads out of our division's area. "Enjoy your last fight."

He then walks out the door, without saying another word.

"Damn it, who was that?" Bruce says. "What did he want?"

"No idea," I say. 

Leila looks at me suspiciously, but she says nothing. Meanwhile, the iron grating in front of us is finally being raised. 

We all make our way towards the center of the arena, like all the divisions before us. 

 "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the fourth division!" the announcer says.

The crowd watches us in complete silence, as we make our way past all the animal carcasses, in order to reach our destination. It's clear that they do not recognize anyone from our division. They're probably already thinking that we're going to get butchered, like that first division from earlier. I hope we won't end up proving them right.
