As we get closer to our destination, I notice that there are no sounds whatsoever coming from the camp, even though with the level I have in my Hearing stat, I would have expected to hear people talking by now. I can only suspect that they must have cast a silencing spell around their base of operations, similar to the spell that Melindra cast when she came into my tent the other night.

When we finally get close enough to the camp, we see that the whole area around it is surrounded by four large, twenty foot tall walls, made of rock. By the looks of it, the walls were probably created by an earth elementalist.

"There's the entrance, over there," Nolderan says, as he points towards a door, which also seems to be made out of stone.

"Quite the impressive camp fortifications you have here, Nolderan," Hadrik says.

"Yes, we have a very talented earth elementalist in our team," Nolderan says. "Step right in."

He then opens the door for us, and we all step inside, one by one. As soon as we enter the camp, we all finally get to see the faces of the five mages from Nolderan's team. One of them is a dwarf, who is sitting on a stone chair, behind a stone table, some two hundred feet away from us, while drinking a bottle of dwarven ale. The other four are all standing behind him, watching over him, as bodyguards.

The other four are all standing behind him, watching over him, as bodyguards.

 As we get a closer look at the dwarf, we recognize him almost immediately. It would be impossible to not know who he is, since his face has been shown in every newspaper, for the past twelve years. The mage that we were looking at right now was none other than Talmak, the Sage of the North.

"Ahahahahahaha!" Arraka starts to laugh loudly, all of a sudden.

"Talmak?..." Daren says, looking very shocked.

"The Sage of the North?" Illuna asks, surprised, looking first at Daren, and then at the dwarf in front of us, with a very unimpressed look on her face. "THIS is the almighty sage you've been talking about?..."

"Ahahahaha!" Arraka keeps laughing in the background.

"You knew about this, didn't you?" Illuna says, as she grabs Arraka's amulet by the chain and looks at it directly. "You knew that one of the mages was a sage from the very beginning!"

"Of course I knew!" Arraka says, still barely containing her laughter. "But I wanted to see the looks on your faces when you saw him for yourselves! Ahahahahaha!!!"

 "Master Nolderan..." Daren says, still in a state of shock. "Why didn't you tell us about the sage being in your team?"

"If I had told you this, would you have followed me here, boy?" Nolderan says.

"You should not blame him for this, healer in armor," Talmak says in a loud voice, as he puts his bottle of ale on the table in front of him. "Your old master works for me, now. He does what I tell him. But do not worry, I did not call you here to fight. I called you here because I wanted to talk. Now, come closer. All of you. I don't like it when I need to shout to make myself heard."

We all exchange a few looks, and then we get ready to traverse the large, empty area between ourselves and the sage's table, together with Nolderan. Just as we were beginning to walk, Melindra pulls both Flower and me by the arm, in order to stop us. When we look at her, we see that she has an unusually serious expression on her face.

"After I snap my fingers, I'm going to need you two to pull me out," Melindra tells us, in a low voice. "Do you understand?"

ID: B2-Ch10b-Guess
TEXT:

 "I guess so..."

"Good," Melindra says, simply, and then I can feel her casting the same air currents on me as she did earlier this morning.

She then walks away, without another word, as she goes to join the rest of the team. Flower and I look at each other for a second, in confusion, and then we decide to head towards the sage as well.

The air currents seem to be calming down as I am walking forward. They're probably waiting for me to give them the signal, whenever I want to start flying. As I approach the stone table, I get a better look at the sage and his henchmen. Talmak is of around the same height as Hadrik in his dwarf form, and he has a long, brown beard that covers most of his face. He looks like a typical dwarf. There's nothing special about him, or anything that makes him look particularly intimidating. I can sort of understand why Illuna was so underwhelmed when she first saw him.

The sage is wearing the same type of heavily enchanted leather armor that Nolderan is wearing, and so is the rest of their team, but neither of them seem to be holding any weapons. I'm guessing that Nolderan is the one who enchanted all of their equipment. 

 Aside from Daren's old master, Talmak's team consists of a banshee, an elf, and two dwarves. Funnily enough, both of the dwarves look more intimidating than the sage. One of them has two big scars on his face, and the other one is wearing an eye patch. The elf has long blond hair, and he has a slim, tall figure. He appears to be rather old, even by elven standards. I'm not really sure how slowly elves age, but I think you'd need to be over one hundred years old to have any noticeable wrinkles on your face. And this elf has got plenty of them.

The woman that the banshee possessed is somewhere in her early thirties. Her eyes are constantly shining with a green light, similarly to how Flower's eyes always shine blue, when Illuna takes over the body. She also has an outwordly aura about her, so it's clear that she is not an artificial mage.

Given that the banshee is obviously long past her awakening stage, I can only assume that the host's soul is long gone, and that the banshee is the only one in control of the body right now. However, I was not aware that a banshee could maintain the original appearance of her host even after her awakening. I thought that Flower and Illuna were a special case, because of the fusion, but it appears I was mistaken. Perhaps I do not know as much about banshees as I would like to believe.

The woman's hair is long and black, and the expression on her face looks ruthless and unforgiving. While we were walking towards her, I could see the banshee take a short glance towards Flower, but then she went back to looking straight ahead of her, awaiting the sage's orders.

 All of the members of our team stop about twenty feet or so in front of the stone table, in order to make sure that we have enough space to move, in case a battle erupts between our two groups. Nolderan, of course, walks past us, and he joins his true comrades, who are currently forming a line behind the sage.

"I see that you are not willing to advance any further," Talmak says, as he takes another sip from his dwarven ale bottle. "No matter. At least you are close enough that I don't need to shout. Let's get down to business, then, shall we?"

He then puts his bottle down, and places his hands on the table, while looking at us.

"I think you may have already guessed that all of the pinecone-collecting mages outside are working for me," Talmak says. "They are all mages who have agreed to give up on participating in this tournament, and to spend the rest of their time here helping me win instead. In exchange for their services, they will be receiving generous rewards, many of them unobtainable by normal means. As you all know, when you become a sage, you receive many benefits. You also gain a lot of influence, with many people. And I can use this influence, to make people's wishes come true. Now tell me, Daren, would you not by any chance have any wishes that you would want to come true?"

"My wish is to gain access to the Magium," Daren says, with a very serious tone in his voice. "But from what I'm gathering, this is the one wish that you would not want to grant me..."

 "Don't be a fool, boy!" Nolderan says. "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You will never get a chance like this again. For once in your life, use that rusted brain of yours and think!"

"I think I'm starting to understand what's going on, here," Daren says. "It wasn't by accident that you found our camp, was it, master Nolderan? You already knew that I'd be there, and you were sent to bring me here by the sage, so he'd offer me this deal. I thought I had made myself sufficiently clear that I would not become your henchman when I didn't answer your letter, Sage Talmak. Why did you feel the need to make this offer to me again?"

"He's made this offer to you before?" Hadrik asks, surprised.

"Yes," Daren says. "He sent me a letter not long after the tournament was first announced. I'm guessing that master Nolderan must have received a similar letter as well. Except that he actually accepted it."

"Why aren't you being honest with me, Daren?" Talmak says, as he takes another drink from his bottle. "Why don't you tell me the real reason why you won't join me? Who else managed to recruit you before I did? Was it Azarius? Nolderan's told me that you've always admired him. But I can offer you more than Azarius ever could. You have no idea how much knowledge you gain access to when you are a sage. There are so many books that are not shown to the general public. So many restricted areas. I could give you access to all of these. And all I'm asking in return is for you to join my team, and to help me win the Magium. Hell, I'll even extend the offer to all your friends, if you want. You only need to say yes."

 "I wasn't recruited by Azarius!" Daren says. "Don't you understand? I came here on my own! I came here because I'm tired of travelling around the world, trying to save people, while thousands of others are dying somewhere else, where I cannot reach them. No matter how much I trained, or how hard I worked, it was never enough. I couldn't save them all. But once I get the Magium, I may finally become able to achieve my dreams..."

"Boy, are you out of your mind?" Nolderan shouts. "Are you telling me that you are still holding on to your foolish ideals from back when you were still my pupil? When will you finally grow up and accept reality?"

"Grow up?..." Daren says. "And then what? Become Talmak's lapdog, like you did? What happened to you? What happened to the master I knew, who was a proud man that was happy and content with teaching people martial arts and enchanting for a living? What happened to that man who would never bend his knee to anyone, regardless of their social status, or their strength?"

"That man died long ago," Nolderan says. "He died after I lost my sage status, and after everyone abandoned me, forcing me to take up work as a mercenary. But this time it's different. I'm no longer just working for scraps. If we succeed, here, I could finally turn my life around. And so could you, if you wouldn't keep stubbornly holding on to those childish ideals that you've had ever since I first met you!"

 "It seems that my old master truly is dead..." Daren says, as he shakes his head in disappointment. "But my ideals are not. I am sorry to say that I will be refusing your offer once more, Sage of the North."

"Surely, you must be joking..." Talmak says. "You can't seriously be thinking that you have any chance of winning this tournament by yourself, when there are four sages competing against you... There's no way that anyone can be this naive."

"He is serious," Nolderan says. "I can see it in his eyes. It's the same look that he had when he first told me why he wanted to become my disciple. It hasn't changed one bit since then..."

"No, this can't be possible..." Talmak says, in disbelief. "I refuse to believe that this is actually happening... Someone needs to wake this man up! You there! The one without any magical powers. I don't know if you're Daren's servant, or his advisor, but you seem like a man with his head on his shoulders. Try to make him see reason. Please!"

He then stops suppressing his magical power, and for a moment, it feels like the intensity of his aura is hitting me right in the face.

"As far as intimidating auras go, I've seen better," I say, once I've recovered from the initial shock.

"Do you people think this is a game?" Talmak says, as his eyes are still brimming with fury. "Do you all think that this offer I made is something that you can simply refuse? Are you unable to understand the situation you are in?"

"I think we all understand our situation very well, Sage Talmak," Daren says, with a serious tone in his voice. "Judging by the terrified looks that those mages outside were giving us when they saw us travelling alongside Nolderan, I'm willing to bet that you've also threatened them in the same way, and that this is the real reason why you have so many people working for you. But these sorts of tactics won't work on me."

 "Is that so?" Talmak says, as he calms down a bit. "Well, Nolderan, I hope you won't hate me too much if I kill your old disciple. He is simply leaving me no choice, at this point."

"The boy chose this path on his own," Nolderan says. "He was given ample opportunities to see reason, but he wouldn't listen. I am sad that it has come to this, but there is no other way."

"It's good to see that you still care, master Nolderan," Daren says, with a dark look in his eyes.

 "That's mighty generous of you," Hadrik says, with a grin. "But I'm afraid that I'm going to have to refuse."

"I did not come here to become a mercenary," Kate says. "You are not the first powerful adversary that has threatened us since we've arrived in Varathia, and you will not be the last."

"One banshee has denied me, but one remains..." Talmak says. "What do you say, little girl? Will you also make the same reckless choice as your friends? Or will you choose the winning side?"

"I think that you might be greatly overestimating yourself, Sage of the North," Illuna says, in a dismissive tone.

Talmak laughs.

"So you will all die together, then..." he says.

"But what about me?" Melindra says, as she fakes a pleading look in her eyes. "Are you going to kill me too? I am only a defenseless maiden who was being escorted by these warriors. I do not want to die..."

"Hmm?..." Talmak says, looking as if he's only just now noticed that Melindra was also there. "Oh, I suppose there's no need for you to die with them if you don't want to."

 "Then... can I come to your side of the table?" Melindra asks.

"Of course," Talmak says. "And the other girl can come to this side as well, if she wants."

"I will stay here," Leila writes, as Melindra heads over to the sage's side.

The sage first looks a little confused, when he sees the blue writing in the air, but then he understands its significance, and he addresses Leila directly.

"As you wish," Talmak tells her.

"I should have known that you would abandon us with the first opportunity you got, you traitor!" Kate tells Melindra. 

 "Don't take it personally, ice mage," Melindra says with a smirk, as she reaches Talmak's side of the table and she places herself beside him. "I did somewhat enjoy travelling with you and your group. But now it's time to move on. I'm sure that I will find other suitable candidates to escort me to Ollendor, eventually."

"Ahahahahaha!" Arraka starts to laugh all of a sudden.

"What is it that you are finding so amusing?" Illuna says.

"Don't you see?" Arraka says. "Don't you see what is going to happen?"

She then starts laughing again. The sage ignores her completely, and he resumes talking, with a loud voice.

"Well, it would appear that everyone has now chosen their side," Talmak says. "Is there anything else you might want to say, before we commence this massacre?"

 Wait a minute. Something's not right, here. Why would Melindra go out of her way to give me a vague message, if she was just going to betray us afterwards? And why did she specifically request to join the sage's side? If she really wanted to be safe, she could have just flown away, and left us to our fate...

"Just shut up and prepare yourself for battle, will you?" Daren tells the sage, as he readies his sword and shield.

No matter how hard I think about this, it still doesn't add up. Unless...

"Ahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs even louder in the background now.

"Then let us begin..." Talmak says, with a confident grin.

"Yes," Melindra says, with a smirk. "Let us begin!"

She then snaps her fingers with both her hands at the same time, and all of a sudden, a huge tornado engulfs her and the other six mages by her side, sending them flying into the air, before they have the time to react. As the twister keeps spinning them round and round, it seems that the base of the tornado is quickly expanding in size, with every second.

So this was her plan all along... I should have known from the very beginning.

"I knew it!" Arraka says. "I knew that she'd do it the moment she asked to join the sage's side. This girl is even crazier than the half-lessathi. I'm dying of laughter, here, ahahahaha!"

 "But... why?" Kate asks, seemingly in a state of shock. "Why did she do it?"

"Everyone get back!" I shout. "Melindra can't control her powers properly. This tornado may well engulf us too, soon, if we don't get away from it."

"Can't control her powers properly?..." Kate says, confused. "Wait, is this why she's never fought together with us in the past? Because she could risk hurting us by accident?"

"Yes," I say. "Now let's move!"

"But if you knew about this... then why didn't you tell us?" Kate says, as we all move away from the tornado.

"Because she asked me to keep this a secret," I say. "Listen, I don't have time to explain now. We'll discuss this in more detail later. Flower, we need to fly up there and get Melindra out of the tornado."

"What?..." Flower says.

"She asked us to pull her out after she snaps her fingers, remember?" I say. "Now come on. We need to hurry!"

I raise both of my arms into the air, which signals Melindra's air currents to lift me off the ground. Flower then starts her fire jets, and we both head upwards, while also slowly approaching the tornado. After a few seconds of trying to spot Melindra, we finally locate her, as she is spinning continuously along the outer borders of the twister.

 "Come on, let's get her out!" Flower says.

We both fly closer to the tornado, and when we're right next to its borders, I call out to Melindra. 

"Melindra!" I shout, when the tornado spins her towards our side. "Can you stretch your hands towards us on the next rotation?"

Melindra appears to be holding her breath, so instead of answering me, she nods in approval. We wait for her to do a full circle around the tornado, and when she gets right in front of us again, Melindra extends her arms in our direction, as Flower and I each grab one of the arms and quickly pull her out. After flying together with her for a few dozen more feet, in order to make sure that we're far enough from the cyclone, we stop for a while, so she can catch her breath.

 "Took you long enough..." Melindra says, as she starts coughing from all the dust that she's inhaled while inside the twister.

"We came here as fast as we could," I say.

"No doubt," Melindra says. "But it still feels like I've been inside there for a million years. Glad to see that you got my message, at least." 

"Yeah, I did get the message, eventually," I say. "Although, it would have been nice if you had made it a little clearer."

"I couldn't risk it," Melindra says. "They may have had people in that group who could tell when people are lying, by studying their auras. I needed you to be genuinely shocked at my betrayal for this plan to work."

"But couldn't you just create the tornado from afar?" I say. "Why did you have to go all the way to their side to do it?"

"When I make a tornado as big as this," Melindra says, "if I'm not right at the center or straight above it, I won't be able to control it properly."

"What about now?" I say. "Are you able to control it now?"

 "I hope so..." Melindra says. "The hard part was creating it, so as long as I only need to maintain it, I should be able to-- Ugh..."

Melindra suddenly puts her hand on her forehead, as she is trying to suppress a headache.

"Are you alright?" Flower asks, worried.

"I'm fine, I just..." Melindra says, and then she pauses again, while she massages her temples. "I just used too much power all at once, that's all. As soon as I rest a bit, there should no longer be any-- Oh no..."

As Melindra was talking, a few small twisters were starting to form very close to where our friends are standing.

"No, no, no!" Melindra says, as she panics. "I can't stop the cyclones! I can't stop them from forming! I need to undo them all, quick!"

"Just make sure not to also undo the big one by... accident," I say, but before I got to finish the sentence, the big twister was already gone, along with all the small ones.

 "Come on, let's get her out!" Flower says.

"Wait," I say. "I want to first make sure that all the other mages are still in there. If they already got out, they might be hiding behind the tornado, so they can ambush us when we get close."

"Okay, but let's hurry!" Flower says. "I'm not sure how well Melindra can breathe inside that twister..."

It takes us around twenty seconds, but we eventually manage to locate all of our six enemies, and we confirm that they are indeed still inside the tornado. Having ensured that there is no ambush waiting for us, we get as close as we can to the twister, and then I call out to Melindra.

"Melindra!" I shout, when the tornado spins her towards our side. "Can you stretch your hands towards us on the next rotation?"

Melindra appears to be holding her breath, so instead of answering me, she nods in approval. We wait for her to do a full circle around the tornado, and when she gets right in front of us again, Melindra extends her arms in our direction, as Flower and I each grab one of the arms and quickly pull her out. After flying together with her for a few dozen more feet, in order to make sure that we're far enough from the cyclone, we stop for a while, so she can catch her breath.

 "Took you long enough..." Melindra says, as she starts coughing from all the dust that she's inhaled while inside the twister.

"Sorry," I say. "I wanted to make sure that the others were still inside the tornado, so that we wouldn't get ambushed."

"Well, I'm glad to see that you got my message, at least..." Melindra says.

"Yeah, I did get the message, eventually," I say. "Although, it would have been nice if you had made it a little clearer."

"I couldn't risk it," Melindra says. "They may have had people in that group who could tell when people are lying, by studying their auras. I needed you to be genuinely shocked at my betrayal for this plan to work."

"But couldn't you just create the tornado from afar?" I say. "Why did you have to go all the way to their side to do it?"

"When I make a tornado as big as this," Melindra says, "if I'm not right at the center or straight above it, I won't be able to control it properly."

"What about now?" I say. "Are you able to control it now?"

 "I hope so..." Melindra says. "The hard part was creating it, so as long as I only need to maintain it, I should be able to-- Ugh..."

Melindra suddenly puts her hand on her forehead, as she is trying to suppress a headache.

 As soon as they're out of the tornado, the sage and his henchmen start to fall down, while they're coughing and taking large gasps of air. Talmak manages to conjure a floating stone platform out of thin air, and they all land on it, as they're still trying to catch their breaths.

"Let's go back to the ground and group up with everyone else," I say. "We can start fighting when we're all together."

I begin to fly towards the ground, along with Flower, but Melindra is still just floating there, and it appears that she's gotten another sudden headache. The sage notices this immediately, and he uses his powers to magically create a big rock, which he flings towards her, at great speed. Melindra does not get the time to completely block it with her air magic, and the rock hits her hard in the head, making her lose her consciousness.

"Melindra!" Flower shouts, as she rushes to stop her from falling.

Just as the sage tries to hit Flower too, Illuna quickly casts her golden cage spell around herself and Melindra, which makes Talmak's rocks break into pieces at the impact with the cage's golden bars.

"The fox's cage..." Talmak says, as he watches Illuna starting to heal Melindra, while inside their floating cage.

 "So, you know of the golden fox, then?" I ask him.

"I've had more than a few run-ins with her since I came to Varathia, yes," the sage says. "But, more importantly, the situation has now changed. Meet me back down, boy, and we'll have another talk."

He then brings his platform to the ground, along with all of his team, while I also go down and land next to Daren and the others. When my feet hit the ground, I can't help but notice that the air currents around me have calmed down, just like when Melindra cast the spell on me earlier. It appears that the currents are made in such a way that they temporarily deactivate whenever I land on the ground, and if I want to fly again, I need to reactivate them by raising my arms above my head.

"I've changed my mind!" Talmak says all of a sudden, as people were getting ready for battle. "There is no more need for us to fight."

"And to what do we owe this sudden change of heart?" Daren says.

 "You owe it to the stillwater girl, up there in the sky," Talmak says. "You see, I've always been fascinated by the stillwater legends, but I've never really had the chance to see one up close. I've always wanted to study them, and to find out what the source of their power was, but the idea that I would ever have the chance to capture one alive seemed so unlikely, that I never even dared to dream that it might happen. And yet here I am, only a few dozen feet away from an unconscious stillwater, with the only thing standing in my way being that blasted impenetrable cage."

 "What exactly are you trying to say, here?" Daren says.

"I'm saying that I'm willing to offer you safe passage out of our camp, if you hand over the stillwater," Talmak says. "All you need to do is convince your banshee friend to dismiss the cage and stop healing her, and then we'll forget this encounter ever happened. Nolderan, do we still have those collars we found in the ruins that could restrict someone's ability to cast spells?"

"Yes, we still have them," Nolderan says.

"Perfect," Talmak says. "Then we can chain her up and commence the experiments immediately. The tricky part will be to keep her alive while we dissect her, but I know more than a few ways to get around--"

Suddenly, Kate shoots several icicles straight at the sage, while a wall of rock raises itself from the ground to defend him. As the wall crumbles, and the icicles that got stuck within it fall to the ground, Talmak stares at Kate, with a look of utter shock in his eyes.

"Have you gone completely insane?" Talmak says. "You would forfeit your only chance to survive, just for the sake of a--"

 "Stop talking, you filth," Kate says, looking at him with an expression of pure disgust.

"Maybe I haven't made myself sufficiently clear..." Talmak starts to say, adopting his usual authoritative tone.

"Yeah, no, I think we've heard enough," Hadrik says, and he immediately rushes towards the sage, at a shocking speed.

The sage barely has the time to react, and he conjures another wall of rock in front of him, which Hadrik breaks in one punch.

"Enough!!!" Talmak shouts furiously, all of a sudden, as he makes several large spikes of rock pop out from underneath the earth, forcing Hadrik to jump back. "If you're all so eager to march towards your deaths, then I will be more than happy to grant your wishes. I'm going to kill you all myself, and I'm saving the stillwater for last."

"No, you won't," Hadrik says, with a grin, as he makes another lightning fast rush towards the sage, and he attacks him with a flurry of blows, while Talmak is struggling to create enough walls to keep up with his speed.

As Hadrik and the sage have begun their duel, the five henchmen are now getting ready to attack the rest of us.

Trying to attack Talmak with my crossbow would be meaningless, since I already know for a fact that the magical protection against physical damage that he's using is powerful enough to make crossbow bolts bounce right off him. I'll need to attack him from close range if I want to have a chance.

As Talmak's bodyguards leave their employer's side to engage my friends in battle, I signal my air currents to take me off the ground once more, and then I fly as fast as I can, straight for the sage, with my dagger at the ready. 

Talmak sees me coming, and he raises a wall of rock from the ground, to stop me in my tracks. I try to cut through the rock with my weapon, but the blade isn't sharp enough, and it gets stuck inside the stone. As I pull my dagger out, I realize that the rock forming the wall has been hardened through magic, similarly to how Kate often reinforces her icicles before she shoots them at her enemies.

"So, he can also cast air magic to some extent..." Hadrik says, after we recover from the sudden blast of air from earlier. "That bastard. Come on, Barry, let's catch up to him!"

 Surprisingly, Hadrik is having a bit more trouble dealing with the airborne rock slates than I am, because every time he morphs himself into a flying creature, his body becomes weaker, and more vulnerable to these sorts of attacks. He did mention once that he has a technique to harden the aura around him, in order to counteract this weakness, but it doesn't seem to be doing him much good in this situation.

Every time when Talmak tries to smash him between two rocks, Hadrik needs to shapeshift back into a dwarf to deal with the platforms, which prevents him from catching up to the sage. I guess I'm going to have to deal with the sage on my own, for now.

As I continue to punch through rocks on my way to Talmak's platform, the sage just keeps creating more and more of them, making it hard to keep up. Now that I'm looking at the ground, I see that there are also large pieces of rock that got broken off from the earth itself, which are coming towards me at great speed. I won't be able to deal with all of these just through punching. I think it's about time for a change of tactics.

It's time to stop playing games, and to start going on the offensive. Let's see... What can I use against him?

I take a quick look below myself, and I notice that the rocks which were pulled out from the ground are moving slower than the ones that Talmak created himself. He also seems to have a little less control over them, from the way they are shaking. I'm not sure why he'd want to use those rocks if he can't control them properly, but my guess is that he's trying to save energy. Creating large stones out of nothing can be a pretty costly process, after all. Either way, I think I may have just found what I was looking for.

The rocks from below are starting to get closer, now. If only I could find a way to bring them where I want...

I start to punch all of the stone slates that are magically created, while making sure to only dodge the rocks that are coming from the earth below. Soon enough, there is a whole army of boulders following me around, and trying to surround me. The sage is really busy trying to keep Hadrik at bay, so he hasn't yet noticed what I'm doing. This is all working nicely, so far, but I can't afford to make a move until the sage is completely distracted. If he figures out my plan, I'm going to be totally screwed.

I keep dodging and punching rocks until it looks as if Talmak has all of his focus on Hadrik, and then I start flying as fast as I can, straight towards the sage and his platform, which are both right below me.

}
#if(v_combat_technique < 4) {
 Unfortunately, it seems that Talmak was still paying attention to me, and as soon as he sees me approach him, he conjures a large slate of stone, exactly in front of me. I manage to stop before hitting the obstacle, but the rocks that were following right behind me hit me at full speed, and they crush me against the stone slate, killing me instantly.

}
#if(v_combat_technique == 4) {
 As I look behind me, I am pleased to see that the boulders which have been following me around for the past thirty seconds are still right on my tail. I keep a steady course until I'm almost at the platform's level, and at the very last second before hitting it, I quickly change my direction and propel myself out of the way, as the sage is still completely oblivious to what's happening right above him. Just as I predicted, the boulders that were following me could not change their direction quickly enough, so they all crashed right into Talmak's flying platform. 

While the sage noticed the rocks too late to be able to stop them directly, he was still able to conjure a small dome made out of stone all around him, which lessened the impact of the boulders on his own person by quite a bit. That still didn't stop his platform from getting completely destroyed, however, which sent Talmak falling towards the ground, along with all the rubble.

He doesn't get to fall for long, though, because he almost immediately makes another platform below his feet, out of thin air, while blowing all of the debris away in a single move. Looking at his face, he seems to be in a pretty bad mood, right now.

"He's looking pretty pissed, Barry," Hadrik tells me, as he hovers into the air next to me, in his giant eagle form. "You think you can handle him, while I go get Daren? He's the one that specializes against elementalists, after all. Aerial battles are just not my thing."

"Yeah, go get him," I say. "But do it quick. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up."

 As Hadrik heads over to Daren, Talmak ignores him completely, and he uses his platform to come back up to my level. It seems that this time, I've finally gotten his undivided attention.

The sage begins to create even more rocks than before, and he keeps throwing them at me, one after the other. However, his aim seems a little worse than before. It would appear that he isn't able to concentrate as well as he'd want to, when he is this angry.

I begin to focus more on reaching the sage, than on dodging boulders and platforms.

For a while, this works well, but unfortunately there are just so many rocks that it's impossible for me to keep track of them all, while focusing on something else. Eventually, one of the boulders hits me right in the head, and before I get to recover, I get squashed between several layers of rock, which makes me die almost instantly.

Relying on my reflexes to dodge all the incoming rocks at the very last second allows me to be much more reckless with my flying, which helps me get a lot closer to Talmak than before. After a few failed attempts, I finally manage to sneak up on him while he is too busy keeping Hadrik at bay to notice me, and before he gets the time to react, I punch him hard in the face, sending him flying right off the platform.

Normally, that kind of punch should have smashed his head in, but thanks to all of his magical protections, he got away with only a bloody nose. Talmak falls towards the ground for a while, but then he conjures another floating platform below him, to stop him in his tracks.

It's time to stop playing games, and to start going on the offensive. But in order to do that, I'm going to need to pay a little more attention to my surroundings.

As I take a look around myself, I make a mental note of where all the rocks are, so I can be sure that no platforms or boulders will take me by surprise, except for the ones that will be created from this point onwards. I then begin to formulate a strategy in my head, based on how I've seen the sage attack me so far.

Given that Talmak always tries to anticipate where I'm going, while continuously putting obstacles in my way, I should probably change my flying patterns, so that I'm a bit more unpredictable. That way, I'll make him waste his energy on generating stone slates at wrong locations, and he'll be forced to make them chase me, just like he's doing with the boulders that come out of the earth below.

I begin to fly in circles, without any aim or purpose, so that the sage would have a harder time predicting what I will do. This is working, to a certain extent, but it's not really helping me get anywhere near him. I need to keep watching the rocks and to see if I can't find any patterns in how he moves them, that I might be able to exploit.

}
#if(v_perception < 4) {
 As I am busy trying to observe how Talmak is moving and creating his rocks, I lose focus on the boulders that were actually out to get me, and one of them hits me right in the head. Before I have the time to recover, the sage creates even more stone slates, and I quickly get squashed between several layers of rock, which makes me die almost instantly.

}
#if(v_perception == 4) {
 After moving erratically for a while longer and watching the boulders and platforms move after me, I finally start to gain an understanding of how the sage typically reacts to my movements, and this allows me to predict some of his next attacks. It only takes a few mistakes on his part for me to close the gap between us and to finally reach his floating platform. I make sure to close in on him while he is too busy keeping Hadrik at bay to notice me, and before he gets the time to react, I punch him hard in the face, sending him flying right off the platform.

Normally, that kind of punch should have smashed his head in, but thanks to all of his magical protections, he got away with only a bloody nose. Talmak falls towards the ground for a while, but then he conjures another floating platform below him, to stop him in his tracks. Judging by the look on his face, he seems to be in a pretty bad mood, right now.

"He's looking pretty pissed, Barry," Hadrik tells me, as he hovers into the air next to me, in his giant eagle form. "You think you can handle him, while I go get Daren? He's the one that specializes against elementalists, after all. Aerial battles are just not my thing."

"Yeah, go get him," I say. "But do it quick. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up."

 As Hadrik heads over to Daren, Talmak ignores him completely, and he uses his platform to come back up to my level. It seems that this time, I've finally gotten his undivided attention.

The sage begins to create even more rocks than before, and he keeps throwing them at me, one after the other. However, his aim seems a little worse than before. It would appear that he isn't able to concentrate as well as he'd want to, when he is this angry.

 "Stop flying around like a damn mosquito!" Talmak shouts, as I dodge yet another one of his boulders.

"Sorry, pal!" I say. "It's just that I'm pretty good at flying planes, and those skills seem to translate rather well to magical flying. Tough luck, eh?"

"I'm going to greatly enjoy shutting up that smart-ass mouth of yours for good, boy," Talmak says, as he flings another three boulders towards me, which I easily dodge.

"Now you're starting to sound like all those generic thugs that I've beaten on my way here," I say. "Don't you have any better lines to say than that?"

While I keep flying around in circles, I take a look below me, to see what's happening, and apparently Daren was in the middle of a duel with Nolderan when Hadrik landed on the ground and turned himself back into a dwarf. 

Without giving it much thought, Hadrik makes a quick dash towards Nolderan, and he punches him so hard that he throws him into a nearby wall. He then says something to Daren, and he points in my direction. After that, Daren starts healing himself, while Hadrik goes to fight Nolderan in his stead.

 In the meantime, Kate and Leila are busy battling the two dwarf henchmen, who are both fire elementalists, while the elf is making semi-transparent barriers, to defend against Kate's icicles. The banshee on their side is also battling one of my teammates, but it shocks me to find out that this adversary of hers is in fact Illuna. 

I quickly take a look to see what happened to the golden cage and Melindra, and it would seem that they're both in the same place as before. This means that Illuna most likely teleported out, with that daily spell of hers, while leaving Melindra safely inside the cage to continue recovering from her wounds. 

As I observe the black-haired banshee's fighting style, I arrive at the conclusion that she must be a generalist of some kind. She's casting all sorts of spells, ranging from lightning, to fire, to ice, and she also has a few summoned eagles by her side. Either way, I don't really have time to study the battlefield in more detail. It's hard enough to dodge the sage's attacks even without being distracted. 

I dance around in the sky with Talmak and his boulders for a while longer, until I suddenly hear Daren's voice coming from below us.

"Hey, Talmak!" Daren shouts. "Come down here so we can have a duel! One on one! What kind of a coward flies off to the sky like that, where his enemies can't reach him?"

 "Watch your tongue, healer in armor!" Talmak shouts. "Who do you think you're talking to?"

"He does kind of have a point, though," I say, in a loud voice, to make sure that Daren can hear me. "If you really are the strongest earth elementalist of our time, like they say, shouldn't you be able to win against us without these petty tricks? They don't let you fly into the air while you're fighting in the yearly sage contests, do they? So why are you doing that now? Is it because you're afraid of Daren?"

"What did you just say?..." Talmak says.

"He's asking if you're afraid of me, Talmak," Daren shouts. "Answer the man's question, will you?"

"This insolence is going to cost you, healer," Talmak says. "I don't care what the legends say about you. I'm going to pound you into the ground and show you what happens when you mock a sage!"

He then quickly brings his floating platform to the ground, with a loud thud, as he steps off it, and begins to approach Daren. I fly towards them as well, and then I land on the ground, in order to get a better view of the fight.

 I quickly take my crossbow out of the backpack, and start shooting at all of the enemies except for the sage, since I already know for a fact that the magical protection against physical damage that he's using is powerful enough to make crossbow bolts bounce right off him. Sadly, it seems that he's already cast the same protection on his allies as well, because none of the bolts harmed them in any way. Seeing that this weapon is useless to me, I return it to my backpack, and then I unsheathe my scimitar.

As the henchmen head towards us, Talmak knocks Hadrik away from him, with a large boulder, and then he uses the platform below his feet to raise himself high into the air. As soon as he recovers, Hadrik transforms himself into a giant eagle, and he soars into the sky, after the sage.

Nolderan is the first one of the henchmen to attack, and he goes directly for Daren. While the old master and disciple commence their duel, Kate quickly conjures a semi-transparent ice dome around me, her and Leila, just in time to defend us against a barrage of flames, coming from the two dwarves, who are apparently both fire elementalists.

"Don't kill them, yet!" the banshee shouts. "I need to have some answers."

"To hell with your answers, abomination!" the dwarf with the eye patch says. "You should be thankful enough that our master took you under his wing. Do not presume to think that you can give us orders!"

}
 "The sage is not my master," the banshee says. "We only have an agreement. I told him that I'd help him get the Magium, as long as he'd sign me up to this tournament, and let me pursue my own goals on the side."

"The very fact that Sage Talmak is letting you breathe in his presence should be more than enough of a reward for your services," says the dwarf with the scars on his face. "If I were in his place, I would have killed you a long time ago."

As the dwarf finishes his sentence, Kate suddenly unleashes a hundred icicles that she'd been preparing in the sky all this time, and she shoots them at all of the sage's henchmen, including Nolderan. Just as the icicles reach the four enemies in front of us, they all bounce off an invisible barrier, which was surrounding the mages. Nolderan, on the other hand, did not need a barrier to protect himself, and he simply danced out of the projectiles' way, while also fending off an attack from Daren.

 "Could we perhaps continue this argument at a more opportune moment?" the elf says, with a forced smile. "See, if I hadn't shielded you just now, you would have all been dead, already."

"As if!" the banshee says. "Maybe these fools would have died, but I was well aware of those icicles, and was already preparing to dodge them."

"Is that why you haven't even moved an inch, when you were attacked, despite not knowing about my invisible barrier?" the elf says, still forcing himself to smile.

"Shut up," the banshee says, looking a little flustered. "I obviously knew about the barrier!"

"Of course you did..." the elf says. "Listen, just ask your question, quickly, so we can finally start murdering each other, will you?" 

"You there, in the ice dome!" the banshee shouts at us. "I have a question for you. What is the name of the banshee in the amulet?"

 "What makes you think that we'll answer your question?" Kate shouts back at her, through the dome.

"If you answer, then we'll make your deaths quick, and mostly painless," the banshee says. "But if you don't--"

All of a sudden, several fireballs rain down upon the sage's underlings, covering their whole area in explosions.

"Arraka," we hear Illuna's voice, coming from the sky. "Her name is Arraka."

As we look up, we see Illuna hovering a dozen feet above the ground, using Flower's jets, while her eyes are shining with a blue light.

"Wait, how did you get out of the cage?" I ask her.

"You are allowed to cast teleportation spells inside the golden cage, as long as you're the one who conjured it," Illuna says, "The spell has been designed that way, so you could still escape, in case you trapped yourself inside with your enemy, by accident. Luckily, I barely ever use that daily teleportation spell of mine, so I had it ready for this occasion."

"But what happened to Melindra?" I say.

"She is conscious, but still recovering," Illuna says. "The healing spell that I cast on her won't take full effect until at least a few more minutes will have passed. I made sure to extend the cage's duration, so she'd be kept safe until then, although it's taken quite a lot of my magical energy to do it..."

 "Are you two just about done with your conversation, or do you intend to keep ignoring us?" says the banshee who works for the sage.

As we take a look towards Talmak's henchmen, we see that they were unharmed by the fireballs, thanks to the elf's invisible barrier. While the barrier itself is not visible with the naked eye, you can tell that it's still there, by the feel of its magical aura.

"Nobody asked you to wait for us," Illuna says, in a cold voice. "You could have attacked us at any time."

"Oh, I would have attacked you long ago," the dwarf with the eye patch says, "if this sad excuse for an elf hadn't surrounded us all with an impenetrable barrier that works both ways!"

"I will remove the barrier as soon as our banshee friend is done asking her questions," the elf says, in a calm manner. "And also as soon as you promise to not get caught in every single one of the enemy's deadly attacks, like a gang of amateurs."

 "That banshee from the amulet that you called Arraka..." the black-haired banshee starts to ask Illuna, while ignoring the elf. "How old is she, exactly? Do you happen to know if she's been around for more than a thousand years? Perhaps even five thousand?"

"Oh, I've been living for quite a bit more than five thousand years, little girl," Arraka says. "But I think we should both stop beating around the bush. What is it that you want to ask of me, exactly?"

"I will ask you this directly, then," the banshee says, with a dark look in her eyes. "Did you, or did you not cause the banishment of all banshees from the magical realm five thousand years ago?"

 "Aha- Ahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "So there are still banshees who know the story after all these years? Oh man, it looks like not even getting trapped in a mountain for thousands of years is enough to extinguish the flame of a true legend! I am so proud, right now, you have no idea."

"So it is true..." the black-haired banshee says, with the look in her eyes now darker than ever. "I always knew that those rumors were true. The only reason why I came to Varathia was because my information led me to believe that this was where I could find you. And as soon as I felt that sinister aura coming from the amulet, I knew that it would be you. All this pain and suffering that our race has had to endure for millennia... Being forced to live our lives as parasites... All because of you!"

"Well, what are you going to do about it?" Arraka says, in a provocative tone.

"I am going to end you!" the banshee shouts. "I will avenge every single banshee that you've cursed with this torturous existence."

"If you destroy this amulet, you will only free her," Illuna says. "And you will doom us all."

 "If she goes free, then I will kill her again, and again, and again, until she is dead for good," the black-haired banshee says, with her eyes full of rage. "And if you stand in my way, I will kill you too. Undo this barrier, elf. It's about time that we all settled our scores."

"Finally," the elf says, as he dismisses his barrier. "Try not to die in the first five seconds, will you?"

Just as soon as the barrier disappears, the two dwarves channel their magic into a single ray of fire, which they use to attack Kate's ice dome. The ice is being reinforced almost as fast as it is melted, but it's clear that Kate won't be able to keep this up much longer. In the meantime, the black-haired banshee flies up in the sky, and begins to attack Illuna and Flower with a variety of spells. 

Judging by the very different types of spells that she's using, I'm going to guess that she is some sort of a generalist. She's already cast a lightning spell, a sonic spell and a freezing spell, one after the other, while also summoning a few eagles to try and catch Illuna by surprise. Luckily, Flower has done a good job at avoiding the attacks in mid-air, although neither she nor Illuna have managed to land a hit on their adversary, just yet.

 While she is still busy reinforcing the ice dome, Kate shoots a few more icicles at the dwarves, but this time, the projectiles get stopped even further up in the air, by what seems to be a small, flat, semi-transparent barrier, that the elf conjured to intercept them. The elf smiles at Kate, from a distance, which makes Kate frown at him, as she turns her head to Leila and me.

"If either of you could keep some of those three mages busy, while I attack them, it would be highly appreciated..." Kate says.

"Me too," I say. "Open the dome."

Once she gets our confirmation, Kate waves her right hand towards the side of the dome, and she makes an exit for us, which is just the right size for the two of us to fit through.

"Let's target the dwarves, first," I tell Leila. "They seem like the types that focus more on offense than defense, and that elf won't be able to shield them forever. We could try to flank them from two sides. I'll go left."

"So much for the great sage's elite squad, eh?" I tell the elf, as I leave the dwarf corpses behind, and begin to approach him.

"Those were only easily replaceable pawns," the elf says, with a forced smile. "The older members of the team are currently away on an important mission, related to the pinecones. It's too bad that you will never get to meet them, because the sage will obliterate all of you before then."

"The sage?" I ask him. "Not you?"

"I am only in charge of defense," the elf says. "I have no spells that could help me fight you in any way. I'm just going to keep this barrier up until you either tire yourselves out, or get bored. You won't be able to break it anytime soon at this rate."

 "Right..." I say, as I begin to attack him, along with Leila.

While we're dealing with the elf, I can't help but notice that the sky above us is currently filled with big, floating rocks, which Talmak is using to chase Hadrik around, in his eagle form. It looks like Hadrik is at a bit of a disadvantage when fighting aerial battles, due to the fact that the flying creatures which he can morph into are too weak, compared to his regular dwarf form, and he needs to switch back to being a dwarf every time he wants to smash one of the rocks into pieces.

Somewhere below, at a much lower altitude, Illuna and Flower are still busy fighting the black-haired banshee, in mid-flight, although they seem to be very evenly matched, and neither of them has managed to do any significant damage to the other. Flower and Illuna may have the upper hand, in terms of raw power, because there are two of them, but the banshee working for the sage is making good use of the multitude of spells she has at her disposal to compensate for her disadvantage.

"I am only in charge of defense," the elf says. "I have no spells that could help me fight you in any way. I'm just going to keep this barrier up until you either tire yourselves out, or get bored. You won't be able to break it anytime soon at this rate."

"Right..." I say, as I begin to attack him, along with Leila.

While we're dealing with the elf, I can't help but notice that the sky above us is currently filled with big, floating rocks, which Talmak is using to chase Hadrik around, in his eagle form. It looks like Hadrik is at a bit of a disadvantage when fighting aerial battles, due to the fact that the flying creatures which he can morph into are too weak, compared to his regular dwarf form, and he needs to switch back to being a dwarf every time he wants to smash one of the rocks into pieces.

Somewhere below, at a much lower altitude, Illuna and Flower are still busy fighting the black-haired banshee, in mid-flight, although they seem to be very evenly matched, and neither of them has managed to do any significant damage to the other. Flower and Illuna may have the upper hand, in terms of raw power, because there are two of them, but the banshee working for the sage is making good use of the multitude of spells she has at her disposal to compensate for her disadvantage.

"I'm on it," Leila writes.

"Me too," I say. "Open the dome."

Once she gets our confirmation, Kate waves her right hand towards the side of the dome, and she makes an exit for us, which is just the right size for the two of us to fit through.

"Let's target the elf, first," I tell Leila. "If we both attack him at the same time, we might force him to focus the barriers more on himself, than on the dwarves, which will leave his allies defenseless against Kate's icicles. We could try to flank him from two sides. I'll go left."

Leila nods, and then we both walk out of the dome, as Kate closes up the exit behind us. As soon as we're out, Leila starts running towards our enemy, from the right side, while I begin to approach him from the left. When they see us get out of the dome, the two dwarves quickly switch their targets, and they begin to aim for Leila and me, instead. The dwarf with the eye patch seems to be the one focusing on me, while the one with the scars is currently throwing fireballs towards Leila.

As I try to dodge the dwarf's attacks, I suddenly run into an invisible barrier, which blocks my path. I quickly try to run the other way, but I'm too slow, and one of the flames manages to hit me head on, burning me to a crisp, and killing me on the spot.

As I dodge the dwarf's attacks, the elf also tries to block my path with several invisible barriers, but he is clearly having difficulty keeping up with my speed. He is, however, quite efficient in managing to keep Leila and me away from him, because he is greatly limiting our mobility, while we already need to avoid the fire barrages coming from the dwarves.

 Just as I was trying to get around another one of the barriers, Kate shoots dozens of icicles towards the elf, coming from all directions, which forces him to dismiss all the previous barriers and to make a new one, around himself.

This allows Leila and me to finally reach him, and to attack him with many rapid strikes, even though each one of them gets blocked by the invisible barrier around himself. With the elf no longer protecting his allies, Kate immediately starts attacking the two dwarves with icicles, and it doesn't take her long until she manages to kill them both, with a few well-placed shots to their heads.

"So much for the great sage's elite squad, eh?" I tell the elf, as I keep trying to attack him through his barrier, along with Leila.

Leila nods, and then we both walk out of the dome, as Kate closes up the exit behind us. As soon as we're out, Leila starts running towards our enemy, while I begin flying in the elf's direction as well. When they see us get out of the dome, the two dwarves quickly switch their targets, and they begin to aim for Leila and me, instead. The dwarf with the eye patch seems to be the one focusing on me, while the one with the scars is currently throwing fireballs towards Leila.

I easily dodge the flame attacks coming from the dwarf, in mid-air, and then I prepare to dive towards the elf, but just as I'm getting closer, a large, flat, semi-transparent barrier appears right in front of me, blocking my way. When I try to get around it, the barrier just moves along with me, and it doesn't allow me to get past it. I don't get to do this for much longer, because a new barrage of flames forces me to distance myself from the mages, once more.

 In the meantime, Leila seems to be having her own problems with barriers, although the ones that she's bumping into are completely invisible, and can only be detected if you really focus on them with your magical sense. I try to make another dive for the elf, but my path gets blocked by one of his barriers yet again. Just as I was trying to get around it, Kate shoots dozens of icicles towards the elf, coming from all directions, which forces him to dismiss all the barriers and to make a new one, around himself.

This allows Leila and me to finally reach him, and to attack him with many rapid strikes, even though each one of them gets blocked by the invisible barrier around himself.

 Meanwhile, the duel between Daren and Nolderan seems to be much less balanced. The ex-sage doesn't look like he's taken any hits, so far, while Daren is already moving much slower than before, and he appears to have been injured during their battle. I'm not sure how long he'll be able to last at this rate. Maybe I should go help him?

Before I get to think any further on the subject, Hadrik quickly lands on the ground, in his eagle form, and then he turns himself into a dwarf. The sage is still up above, on his platform, with all of his rocks floating around him, and he seems to be waiting for Hadrik's next move.

"Give up, Daren," Nolderan says, with a confident tone in his voice, as he manages to wound Daren yet again, by attacking one of his armor's elbow joints. "I can see that you've learned some new techniques since we've been apart, but you're still no match for me. Maybe if you beg Sage Talmak for mercy, he might still spare your--"

The ex-sage does not get to finish his sentence, because Hadrik suddenly dashes to his side, and he punches him so hard, that he throws him into a nearby wall.

"I think you may have forgotten that this is a team fight, not a duel, old man," Hadrik tells him, with a grin. "You might want to mind your surroundings a little more, next time."

"I'll keep that in mind," Nolderan says, as he struggles to get back up.

 "I'll deal with your old master," Hadrik tells Daren. "You go deal with the sage. Elementalists are supposed to be your specialty, aren't they?"

"They are," Daren says, as he starts casting a healing spell on himself. "I'll take care of him."

"Perfect!" Hadrik says. "Come on, Nolderan, let's have ourselves a fun little sparring match!"

He then rushes towards Daren's old master, and he tries to punch him again, but this time Nolderan was waiting for him, and he dodged his attack effortlessly. As the two of them begin their battle, Daren starts to shout very loudly at the sage, who is still in the sky, waiting for his next opponent.

"Hey, Talmak!" Daren shouts, while his wounds are still being magically healed.  "Come down here so we can have a duel! One on one! What kind of a coward flies off to the sky like that, where his enemies can't reach him?"

"Watch your tongue, healer in armor!" Talmak shouts. "Who do you think you're talking to?"

 "He does kind of have a point, though," I say, in a loud voice, to make sure that Talmak can hear me. "If you really are the strongest earth elementalist of our time, like they say, shouldn't you be able to win against us without these petty tricks? They don't let you fly into the air while you're fighting in the yearly sage contests, do they? So why are you doing that now? Is it because you're afraid of Daren?"

"What did you just say?..." Talmak says.

"He's asking if you're afraid of me, Talmak," Daren shouts. "Answer the man's question, will you?"

"This insolence is going to cost you, healer," Talmak says. "I don't care what the legends say about you. I'm going to pound you into the ground and show you what happens when you mock a sage!"

He then quickly brings his floating platform to the ground, with a loud thud, as he steps off it, and begins to approach Daren, who is now completely healed.

 After a short walk, Talmak stops at a distance of around one hundred feet from Daren, and he eyes him intensely. 

As the sage and Daren are getting ready to start their battle, everyone else temporarily stops what they were doing to watch the fight, except for the black-haired banshee, who is still flying after Flower, and shooting various spells at her.

 "You can do it, Daren!" I say. "If you win this fight, they will be writing stories of you for many more years to come!"

"This is going to be his last story, boy," Talmak says. "I'm going to make sure of it."

The sage then creates two boulders that are twice the size of Daren, and he launches them both towards him, with his earth magic. Daren uses his sword to slice through the two boulders in a single motion, but instead of cutting them, the sword goes through them as through butter, and the rocks get smaller and smaller, in the span of a few seconds, until they become marble sized. The two marbles then begin to rotate around Daren's sword, as if the blade were their center of gravity.

"What?..." Talmak asks, in a state of shock. "No, this can't be..."

The sage immediately creates two more boulders that are even larger than before, and he throws them both at his opponent, while Daren begins to slowly walk towards him. Just like last time, Daren slashes through the two rocks in one motion, which causes them to shrink, and to join the other two marbles in gravitating around the sword.

"What's the matter, Talmak?" Daren says, with a dark look in his eyes, as he continues to slowly walk towards him. "Weren't you going to punish me for my insolence?"

 "Sage Talmak!" Nolderan shouts, as the sage is beginning to panic a little. "Daren's sword can absorb the elements. You can't fight him with any rocks that are magically created. Use regular rocks! He won't be able to absorb them fast enough!"

"Oh, so that's how it is..." Talmak says.

He then begins to use his magic to pull several large boulders out of the earth, but before he manages to do it, Daren flings his sword at him with all his might, which sends all of the four marbles flying towards the sage. 

The stone marbles quickly regain their original sizes, in mid-flight, while Talmak is forced to drop the rocks that he was pulling out of the earth, and to make a large, thick wall of stone in front of him, in order to defend himself from the incoming boulders. His wall isn't enough to guard him completely, however, and one of the boulders manages to hit him directly, knocking him on his back.

 "Don't let him stab you with that sword!" Nolderan shouts. "He has a technique that can sever your link to the magical plane!"

As Daren makes a rush towards Talmak, the sage touches the ground with his hand while he's still lying on his back, and then the earth immediately begins to shake with such power that it makes us all fall to the ground. While the earthquake is still going, Talmak raises himself to the air with yet another floating platform, while the earth below our feet is shaking so violently, that it's beginning to crack.

"Damn it, he's cheating again!" I say, as I look at the sage flying off in the sky.

"I think we may be having some bigger problems to deal with, at the moment," Daren says, as he's struggling to get back on his feet, due to the violent earthquake.

Soon, the cracks in the ground grow larger, and the earth itself starts to split in half, creating a large, bottomless chasm right in front of our eyes. And as if this weren't enough, large chunks of rock are now being pulled from under our feet, leaving us with no ground to stand on, and sending us falling into the great abyss below.

 The elf immediately makes a floating magical barrier below his feet, and another one for Nolderan, while Kate makes several floating ice platforms, right below us, in order to save us from the fall. Just before we reach the platforms, Kate, Leila, Daren, Hadrik and I all find ourselves suddenly floating in mid-air, as we are getting slowly raised from the chasm.

When we look up, we see Melindra, floating a few dozen feet above us, with that serious expression in her eyes again, while she's making slow hand movements, to aid her in directing the air currents that are keeping us afloat.

"Melindra!" Flower says, as she is still being chased by the black-haired banshee in mid-air. "You shouldn't be casting powerful spells so soon after being healed!"

"I'm fine," Melindra says, while she pulls us out of the pit. "Don't worry about me. You should be worrying about what the sage is doing up there, instead."

As we all take a look to see what's happening, we are shocked to find out that all of the rocks which were being pulled from the ground are now gathering up, to form a fifty foot tall golem, made out of stone, with the sage standing inside its head, on his floating platform from before.

 He then uses his earth powers to move the walls of rock on the sides of the chasm closer together, in order to create a path for his stone giant to walk on. The earth is trembling violently once more, as the pit below us gets narrower by the second, until the walls forming the crevice get joined together, leaving nothing but a small crack in the earth, between them.

In the meantime, Melindra makes us float until we are at a relatively safe distance from the golem, and then she lands us on the ground.

"Healer, you might want to make a barrier around everyone," Melindra says. "And make it stronger than any barrier that you've ever cast before. I do not have a lot of control over the spells that I'm about to use from this moment onwards."

"Oh..." Daren says. "Alright. I'm on it."

He then uses his shield to make a semi-transparent magical barrier around all of us, while Melindra begins to fly higher into the air.

"Flower, you need to take your fight elsewhere," Melindra says. "Get as far away from here as possible. I'm not planning to hold back."

 "Okay!" Flower says. "Follow me, banshee! This way!"

She then propels herself in the direction opposite to the golem, with her fire jets, as the black-haired banshee rushes to follow her. When Flower is safely out of the way, Melindra casts a spell, and suddenly we can see hundreds of sharp looking blades made of wind rotate around her, at great speed. The wind blades are likely sharpened in the same way that Illuna or Kate sharpen their own elements, and they are mostly transparent, except for when the light of the sun shines on them.

While Melindra is raising herself higher up, the giant made of stone begins to move forward, at a slow pace, and the sage's henchmen are now hurrying to get out of the golem's way, so that they won't get stepped on.

All of a sudden, Melindra loses control of one of her wind blades, which flies at an incredible speed right into the ground in front of us, cutting through it as if it were made from paper.

"Damn..." Daren says, as he looks at the hole in the ground left by the blade from earlier. "I really hope that my barrier is strong enough to protect us from one of these, if it hits us..."

 "Would your barrier work more effectively if we huddled closer together?"

"Yeah, that would help a little, because I'd need to cover less area," Daren says. "Come on, let's get closer to each other, and I'll make the barrier smaller."

We all gather closer to Daren, and then he recasts his barrier, this time with a much narrower area of effect.

"I heard what you were saying about me earlier, you know..." Melindra shouts at the sage, from high up in the sky, with a rather calm tone in her voice. "I heard you talking about how you needed to keep me alive while dissecting me. You sure do have some nerve to speak about a stillwater like this, don't you?"

"You're a little too late, stillwater girl," Talmak shouts back at her. "Maybe you could have stopped me before I made this golem, but now, even one of your tornados won't be able to destroy what I've created. I don't know what you're trying to do with those small rotating blades of yours, but I assure you that they will not help you in any way."

"Is that so?..." Melindra says.

"I've heard enough of your talking," Talmak says. "If I can't use you as an experiment, then you have no value to me. Prepare to die!"

 After the sage stops talking, his golem quickly extends its right arm towards Melindra, and it tries to crush her in its hand. However, as soon as the hand tries to close in around Melindra, the hundreds of wind blades that were rotating around her react all at once, and they cut the rocks into tiny pieces in a matter of seconds.

"No..." Talmak says, in complete shock, as he looks at the golem arm before him, which is now missing its hand entirely.

"I believe it is time to show you, Sage Talmak, why air is the strongest of all the magical elements..." Melindra says, and then she unleashes ten times more blades than she had before, throwing them all in the stone giant's direction.

The thousands of wind blades all soar through the air, at breathtaking speed, and for a few seconds, we could see a great spectacle of shimmering lights, as the sun was getting reflected into each of the blades, in turn. The great stone giant from before was now being sliced into pieces before our very eyes, and while the sage was still trying to bring several boulders from the ground, to replace some of the lost parts, these rocks were getting cut as well, by the multitude of semi-transparent air blades that Melindra was still sending towards Talmak.

 A few stray blades also hit Daren's barrier, during this time, but it seems to be holding well, for now.

When he realizes that there's no way his regular rocks can withstand Melindra's bombardment, Talmak quickly creates a wall in front of him, and then he uses his magic to fortify it as much as he can.

"Delvram!" the sage shouts at his elf companion. "Get us out of here, now! We won't last for another minute at this rate!"

 "Maybe you could try to use your sword to absorb the wind blades."

"I did think of that," Daren says, "but I'm not sure if I'd be fast enough to catch one of them, and if I miss it, I could risk getting my arm cut off..."

"What if you hold your sword through the magical barrier, and keep your arm inside?" I say. "You can do that, right?"

"Yeah," Daren says. "I guess I could give it a shot."

"I heard what you were saying about me earlier, you know..." Melindra shouts at the sage, from high up in the sky, with a rather calm tone in her voice.

 A few stray blades also hit Daren's barrier, during this time, but it seems to be holding well, for now. There's also the fact that Daren managed to catch one or two wind blades with his sword, so there wasn't as much strain on the barrier as there could have been.

When he realizes that there's no way his regular rocks can withstand Melindra's bombardment, Talmak quickly creates a wall in front of him, and then he uses his magic to fortify it as much as he can.

"Wow..." Daren says, when Melindra gets close to us. "That was... really impressive."

"What?..." Daren says. "No! Of course not! What are you even saying? Do you know how risky it would be to try and cast a spell like that on you, given the nature of your stillwater aura? You could even die from something like that. I would never even dream of casting such a spell on you!"

"You wouldn't?..." Melindra says, looking slightly taken aback.

"Listen," Daren says. "I think I'm starting to understand why you never told us about your problem. And I don't blame you. We didn't exactly start off on the best of terms, and you had no reason to trust us, just as we didn't trust you. But for what it's worth, I think you made the right call. You should not risk joining any of our battles, unless we have absolutely no other way of dealing with our enemies. Any other type of strategy would be too risky."

"I agree," Kate says. "Even if she doesn't put us in any immediate danger, a slight scratch from one of her wind blades could be all it takes for the oath to be set off, and to kill her where she stands. As long as there isn't some other sage waiting around the corner, we should be able to handle any situation by ourselves, just as we've done in the past."

 She then turns to Melindra, with a hesitant look in her eyes.

"And I'd like to say that I'm... sorry for misinterpreting some of your intentions in the past few days," Kate says. "I understand now that you were only trying to look out for yourself, and that you meant us no harm."

"Barry, what did you do to them?" Melindra asks me, while looking somewhat terrified. "They're not acting like themselves! Does your stat device have some mind-affecting spell that I don't know of?"

"They're just trying to be nice, Melindra," I say. "There's no need to act so shocked about it. Also, could we maybe move away from this camp? I have a feeling that we're going to start getting attacked by a hundred pinecone-collecting underlings if we stay in this place much longer..."

 "Good thinking!" Daren says. "But what about the sage, and master Nolderan? Maybe they're still lurking around here, somewhere."

"Nah, they're both gone," Arraka says. "And so are their other allies that you were fighting earlier. If I'm not able to sense them, then they must have teleported to their real base. You know... the one that is not just an empty area with a stone table in the middle..."

"You're probably right," Daren says. "Come on, let's get going, and we'll talk more on the way."

As we walk away from the camp area, we notice that the mages who were collecting pinecones earlier are all gone. They must have run away when they saw the giant made out of stone. And who could blame them? It's not like you see something like that every day.

"So, just to make sure that we're all on the same page, here..." Melindra says, while we're walking through the empty forest. "You guys don't want to cast any sort of spells on me to fix my problem with controlling my powers..."

"That's right," Daren says.

"And you want me to continue to avoid all of your battles, just like before?..." Melindra asks.

 "Exactly," Daren says.

"Okay, I'm going to be honest," Melindra says. "This still sounds a little fishy to me. But I guess I'm going to have to trust your word, for now... I mean, I did witness with my own eyes how icey took my side, against the sage, after all..."

"Oh, you saw that..." Kate says, looking a little flustered.

"Well, technically I couldn't really turn my head, back then, so I mostly only just heard it happen, but yes..." Melindra says. "I almost thought that I was hallucinating there, for a second. Of all the people that I would have expected to attack the sage first, in that situation, Kate would have been the last on my mind."

"You... just called me by my real name..." Kate says, looking very surprised.

 "I suppose I did, icey," Melindra says, with a slight smile. "I suppose I did..."

"So, which way are we headed?" Daren says.

"We'll go straight ahead for another few hours, until we reach a small lake," Melindra says. "We'll take a break there, and then I'll show you the rest of the way."

"I hear you," I tell her simply, after I tap the transceiver.

 I decide to take out my device, and to activate the secret code that Melindra taught me a few days ago, just like the revenant asked. Once I'm done, I put my device back in my pocket, and I continue to walk alongside the others.

"Was that the revenant again?" Daren asks, as he gets closer to me. "What did she want?"

"She wanted me to enter my secret code in the stat device, so I can boost my hearing," I say. "I didn't really see a reason why I shouldn't do it, so I did what she said."

"Huh..." Daren says. "Well, I sure hope that this isn't a trap of some sort."

"I don't think so," I say. "I mean, this code just boosts my hearing for a short while. I don't really see what--"

As I was talking, I suddenly realized something that I hadn't noticed before. According to Melindra, the secret code should have only improved my hearing for a few seconds, but for some reason, my hearing is still better than it was before I used the code. Did the revenant use some sort of trick?

 "What's the matter, Barry?" Daren says. "Why did you stop talking?

"The hearing stat..." I say. "It's still being boosted. It was supposed to go back to its original level, after a few seconds, but for some reason, that didn't happen."

"Well, maybe your device is broken, or something," Daren says.

"I don't know..." I say. "I feel like that would be too big of a coincidence."
