"Hey, Barry, are you done eating?" Daren says. "It's almost time for our daily strategy meeting with Arraka."

"Yeah, I'm pretty much done," I say, as I leave my plate on the ground and begin to follow Daren. "Let's go."

It has now been three days since our encounter with the God of Time. We've been steadily approaching the city of Ollendor for these past few days, and according to Melindra we should be reaching our destination tomorrow, before noon. While we've been travelling, we all tried to avoid speaking about the rituals we went through as much as possible, and we did our best to act as if nothing had changed. However, even if on the surface our discussions didn't seem much different from before, it was becoming clearer with every passing day that each one of us had been affected in some way by the God of Time's trials.

This is probably also the reason why most of the people from our group eventually agreed with my idea of having Arraka train us to defeat Selkram. Some were more reluctant than others, but in the end the only two persons not officially participating in our daily meetings were Leila and Melindra. Considering that Leila will be remaining in Ollendor with her father and that Melindra will no longer be travelling with us after she will be done with her oath, it is probably better that way. Arraka's plans seem like they will be taking a lot of time to accomplish, after all.

 "I still can't believe that we're actually having these meetings with Arraka..." Daren tells me, as we slowly climb towards our meeting spot, which is located on top of a small hill near our camp. "If you had told me a week ago that I'd ever agree to do something like this, I would have laughed in your face."

"It's not like we have much of a choice," I say. "You said it yourself. We don't have any kind of experience in dealing with gods. The only one in our group who has ever fought against them on equal terms is Arraka. If it were only up to us to make a battle plan, we wouldn't even know where to begin..."

"Yeah, yeah, I get it," Daren says. "It's just that it feels weird, you know? It was not so long ago that she tried to kill us. Actually, what am I saying? She did kill us, before the time got reversed. And now she's suddenly acting as our coach? Why would she agree to any of this? It's all a bit fishy, if you ask me."

"She does have her own beef against the gods, though," I say. "They're the ones who banished her from the magical realm, remember? Of course she'd want to get back at them in any way she can. And since she's been trapped in an amulet for decades, we're the best chance she's got."

 "I suppose..." Daren says. "But even so, I'm still planning to take everything she says with a grain of salt. There's still a chance that this is just one of her usual schemes, and she's making us waste our time for her own amusement."

As we finally reach the top of the hill, we see that everyone except me and Daren was already there, waiting for us. It looks like Leila and Melindra have decided to join the meeting as well, even if they are only participating as spectators. Leila has also spectated our meetings the last two times, but Melindra didn't bother to join us until now. I guess that curiosity must have finally gotten the better of her when she saw that these training sessions were actually becoming a regular thing, instead of us just giving up after the first two tries.  

"You're late!" Arraka tells Daren and me, as we are approaching her and the others. "The penalty for tardiness in my class is twenty push-ups. And you'd better not try to cheat, or I'll make you wear a dunce hat and send you to sit in a corner!"

 "Fine, fine, I'll do the push-ups," I say.

"Since when does Arraka get to tell us what to do?" Daren says.

"Who cares?" I say, as I get down on the ground and start doing the twenty push-ups. "It's just a bit of physical exercise, anyway. I'd rather do this than waste my time arguing about it endlessly."

"Yes, but still, it's a matter of principle!" Daren says. "And besides, I'm wearing heavy armor so I don't feel like taking it off just to play along with Arraka's comedy routine."

"Oh, yeah?" Arraka says. "Well, what if I decide that I no longer want to play along with your comedic efforts of trying to defeat a god, then? I was just helping you out of boredom, anyway. Weren't you the ones who begged me on their hands and knees to give them the information they needed?"

"Actually all I did was ask you a simple question," I say, as I get up from the ground. "You're the one who jumped on the opportunity to take your vengeance on the gods with the first chance you got, not me."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "Come to think of it, you never did beg properly for me to help you! How about we fix that situation by you getting on your knees right now? If you sound desperate enough, I may just agree to continue your little training sessions."

 "Or maybe you could stop wasting everyone's time and get on with the meeting," Illuna says, in a firm tone of voice. "We didn't come here to hear your ramblings."

"Alright, fine!" Arraka says. "I was just having a little fun, that's all. There's no need to be so uptight about every single thing. Everyone gather round. It's time to check up on all your progress."

I'm not sure if it's only my imagination, but Arraka seems to be acting a lot more obediently towards Illuna nowadays, and she's also taking her more seriously than she did before. I think her whole attitude towards her ex-disciple has started to slowly change ever since that time when Illuna threatened to throw her back into the Magium. It looks like even though she won't admit it, Arraka might have gained a newfound respect for Illuna after seeing the way she confronted her during those events.

"Let's start with Daren, then," Arraka says. "This should be good. Tell me, Daren, how much progress have you made in contacting the spirit from the magical plane that you are linked with? Is it zero? Please tell me that it's zero again. That would be hilarious!"

"Well, maybe it would be more than zero if your advice could amount to anything other than meaningless gibberish," Daren says. "I mean, how are you supposed to get any useful information out of vague phrases such as 'You need to untangle the flow of your aura with your mind, until you can see it clearly in your head,' or 'You can think of the link to your spirit as a very long, invisible string, which you can grab onto and pull on, until you manage to get the spirit's attention' ?"

 "Only an oaf like you could see my words of wisdom as anything other than a pure blessing!" Arraka says. "Do you have any idea how many would kill to have me as their mentor? Well, not specifically me, but someone like me, with thousands of years of knowledge about magic, and who originates from the very plane of existence where all of the magical energy in this world is coming from. And instead, look what you're doing! You are just squandering away all of this immense potential, for the simple reason that you are too lazy to try to understand what I'm teaching you."

"I did try to understand!" Daren says. "But none of what you've said is making any sense to me."

"Well, then try harder!" Arraka says. "Or ask better questions. What is it that you are having trouble with? Is it the visualization part? Is it the fact that your magical sense is too weak to tell the difference between the countless layers that make up your aura? Can you even do elementary stuff, like being able to tell how old a person is from analyzing their aura? I have no idea what you weaklings are capable of. All I know is that your magical sense is nowhere near as refined as mine, but that could mean anything."

 "How about you do twenty push-ups first, and I'll do mine right afterwards?" I say.

"Be careful, Barry-boy..." Arraka says. "If you're going to crack jokes like that, I might get the wrong impression that you no longer want any of my help. After all, I'm only doing these strategy meetings out of the kindness of my heart. I have no obligation to continue helping you if you can't even be bothered to mind your own tongue."

"Well, I'm no expert in killing gods," I say, "but somehow I doubt that these push-ups are going to get me any closer to my goal of defeating the God of Time..."

 "We can't tell anything beyond the basics, you stupid old hag," Hadrik says. "We already told you this yesterday!"

"But what are the basics for you people?" Arraka says. "Being able to tell somebody's age or their race from their aura is considered as basic on the magical plane. Can you do that, at least?"

"No, of course not!" Hadrik says. "All we can tell from an aura is how much magical power someone has. We mostly just use this sense to figure out where our enemies are, and if they can cast any magic."

"That's it?..." Arraka says, shocked. "Well why the hell didn't you say that from the beginning? That changes everything! What you morons need to be doing first is basic aura training. Start with breathing exercises and work your way up from there. Seriously, how could you even get to this level of magical proficiency without mastering the basics? With your levels of magic power it should be an elementary task to figure out someone's age. Just focus on the small, rotating, currents right above a person's head. The ones that give off a cold vibe, even if they look like they're letting out steam. You won't see them on your first try, but if you look really carefully, you'll notice that they are masked by a sort of waterfall that is blocking your view. Obviously, when I'm telling you to look carefully I mean with your magical sense, not with your eyes..."

 "That description sounds even worse than the ones you gave us yesterday!" Hadrik says. "How do you even make this stuff up?"

"Yeah," Daren says. "If you ask me, she's probably doing it on purpose, in order to make it-- wait a minute..."

He then gets closer to Flower, in order to have a better look at Arraka's amulet.

"Did you just say something about a waterfall?..." Daren says, as he looks at the amulet intently.

"Yeah, the age is hidden right behind it," Arraka says. "You need to imagine yourself passing through the waterfall and grabbing the rotating currents between your hands, until they stop moving. That's when the age number will become clear enough for you to read."

 "Hahahaha!" Hadrik laughs. "Daren, did you hear that? I think she wants you to go for a swim!"

Daren does not say anything, and he keeps looking straight at Arraka's amulet in deep concentration.   

"Daren?..." Hadrik says.

"No, no, no, this can't be right..." Daren tells Arraka, after a short while. "It tells me here that your age is negative three hundred fifteen. Unless I'm supposed to decipher it or something, this number doesn't tell me anything."

"Don't read my age, you dope!" Arraka says. "I'm hiding it on purpose, so people can't tell exactly how old I am. I've also taught Illuna to do the same. Read somebody else's aura. Like that of the ice mage. Or that of the mute girl. Neither of their ages is hidden in any way, and they should be easy for you to see."

 Daren does as Arraka says, and he now shifts his gaze towards Kate. After giving her a pondering look for a good ten seconds, he finally decides to speak again, addressing Kate directly.

"Kate, you are twenty-two years old..." he says. "Is that correct?"

"Yes," Kate says. "I think so. I never got to meet my parents so I don't know my exact birth date, but based on the age estimation they gave me when I first joined the Beacon, what you said should be accurate."

"And Leila, you are nineteen years old?" Daren asks, after he also looks at Leila for a few seconds.

Leila nods.

"Barry is twenty-eight years old, like he said, and Hadrik is..." Daren says, but he then stops suddenly, while he keeps looking above Hadrik's head.

"I think something's wrong, here," Daren says. "Hadrik's aura shows me that he is over one hundred years old, but that can't be his real age. Can it?..."

Hadrik laughs.

"The aura is not wrong, Daren," Hadrik says. "We giants live a lot longer than humans. By your standards, I probably appear to be about as old as you, but in reality I'm a lot older."

 "Huh..." Daren says. "I guess the reason why I was so surprised is because I always keep forgetting that you are a giant. In your dwarf form, you look as if you were in your forties."

"What about me?" Flower asks Daren. "What does my aura say about my own age?"

"Your age?" Daren asks, as he looks above her head for a few seconds.

He then opens his mouth to say something but he changes his mind, and only answers her a few seconds later.

"Nine years old," Daren says. "It says you're nine years old."

"Noooooo!" Flower says, visibly frustrated. "That's not what it says! It says I'm twenty-nine! Petal, tell him what it really says!"

"The only thing I see when I look at your age is the number nine," Illuna says.

"No, there's a 'two' right before that 'nine' and you know it!" Flower says, as I can see Daren smirking in the background. "I can sense the aura above my head just fine, and it says twenty nine! I know you can see it!"

"How about you two continue your drama in your own free time?" Arraka says. "After all, we didn't come here to hear your 'ramblings', isn't that right, Illuna?"

"Very well," Illuna says, as her expression darkens. "You may continue with your training session."

"Thank you!" Arraka says. "So, as I was saying, what Daren and Hadrik need to be focusing on right now is to learn the basics of reading auras. The real basics, I mean. Not the kind of stuff that can be done by literally every person in the world. As powerful mages, you should have the advantage of being able to learn this stuff in a matter of days instead of years, with a little guidance. I'll give you more specific information at the end of this meeting. Daren seems to be reasonably adept at this sort of thing when he tries, but I'm not sure what to say about the dwarf. You kind of need to have a certain level of intelligence to be able to master the basics, and Hadrik isn't exactly what you'd call a scholar. Still, we will see what can be done."

 While Hadrik mumbles what appears to be a dwarven swear under his breath, I decide to ask Arraka a question about the auras, while we are still on this topic.

"Should the rest of us also be practicing our aura reading skills?" I say.

"No," Arraka says. "Like I said just now, if you're not already a powerful mage then you would need years to master the basics, so you for example would just be wasting your time. Kate is a relatively powerful mage and she would probably benefit from learning this stuff, but I'd prefer it if she focused on the tasks I gave her instead, since our time is limited. Illuna more or less knows the basics already and Flower didn't exactly learn them, but she can figure out some of the stuff at first glance, likely as a result of being an ethereal. And as for the mute girl... uh... Leila was her name, right? Anyway, so I think Leila may already know quite a bit more than the basics, since she's able to tell from your auras if you are lying or not. That's a pretty rare ability to have, even for a lessathi, so as far as aura reading skills go, she's on another level compared to you lot. I'm not sure if this is a result of many years of practice, or if she's just particularly talented in this field, though."

"I'm not really all that talented..." Leila writes. "A lot of the time I fail at calling people's bluffs, even after reading their auras. It's only for people that are very easy to read, like Barry, that I always manage to tell if they're lying or not."

 "The mute girl brings up a good point," Arraka says. "Barry, your bluffing skills are simply abysmal. Your face and your tone of voice might not give you away most of the time, but when you lie about something, your aura just shakes like crazy. If you don't do something about this problem of yours, you might risk giving us away to Selkram before we even get the time to put our plan into motion. Get control of your aura, already!"

"And how would you expect me to do that?" I say.

"By investing some points in your Bluff stat, obviously," Arraka says. "Do I really need to tell you everything?"

"My... Bluff stat?..." I say.

"Yeah, the one that helps you keep the flow of your aura calm, even when you tell a bald-faced lie," Arraka says. "It's literally called 'Bluff'. You can't miss it."

"What are you talking about?" I say. "I don't have a bluff stat on my stat device! And neither does Leila!"

"What?..." Arraka says. "No, that can't be right. You must be looking in the wrong place or something. Give me that stat device of yours. Bring it close to my amulet, so I can study the magical particles on its screen properly. I'll find that stat for you."

 "Well, if you say so..." I say, as I pull the stat device out of my pocket and bring it right in front of Arraka's amulet.

After about fifteen seconds of silence, Arraka finally decides to speak again.

"Something isn't right, here..." she says. "It's not only your Bluff stat that is missing. The other two aura-related stats are missing too. I'm not seeing the Magical Sense stat or the Aura Hardening stat anywhere on the screen! Could they have been removed? No... Hidden! They're most definitely hidden. I think these stats may be hidden by default, and the guys I saw using stat boosters six hundred years ago must have had them unlocked manually. That's the only explanation I can come up with."

 "Did you just say something about an Aura Hardening stat?" I say, as I put the stat device back in my pocket. "Is that supposed to be something similar to the technique invented by Hadrik so he could defend himself in his shapeshifted state, when he couldn't cast protection magic on himself?"

"Huh?..." Arraka says. "Oh, yeah, the dwarf does use something like that. But he's obviously not the first one to have invented this technique. Many others have come up with similar techniques in the past, which have more or less the same purpose. Never mind that, though. I think I may have found a new task for you and Leila. I'm guessing that you still haven't made any progress towards unlocking your Magical Power and Magical Knowledge stats, but maybe you'll have more luck if you try to unlock your aura stats. You should get Daren to help you too, since he's an enchanter. But make sure that you don't tamper with your device too much. We wouldn't want you to accidentally break your stat booster, and to become even more useless than you already are."

What is most crucial right now is that Daren and Hadrik find a way to contact the spirits they are linked to in the magical plane. Everything else comes second."

"I don't get it," Melindra says. "Why is it so important for Hadrik and Daren to contact these spirits? How would that help them in any way to fight the God of Time?"

"Well, one of the reasons why Daren needs to contact his spirit is so that he can finally be rid of the incredibly inconvenient weakness of not being able to make magical barriers against physical attacks. It's pretty obvious that this problem of his comes from the fact that he is incorrectly linked with his spirit, so if they talk things out, maybe they'll find a way to fix it. That way, he could finally ditch that ugly armor of his and wear something more fit for a mage, like some light leather armor. Not to mention that according to his ex-master, a lot of the moves he's been taught cannot be used due to the weight of his armor, and we all saw how well that old geezer could fight. If Daren could use even half of those fancy moves, it would be a huge improvement."

 "I'd rather wait until we meet up with Leila's father, so he can have a look."

"Suit yourself," Arraka says. "In that case, you can get back to trying to crack the code needed to unlock your magic stats. That should be less risky. You can still try to get some help from Daren, but you should take care not to pester him unless he's taking a break from his aura training. What is most crucial right now is that Daren and Hadrik find a way to contact the spirits they are linked to in the magical plane. Everything else comes second."

"I don't get it," Melindra says. "Why is it so important for Hadrik and Daren to contact these spirits? How would that help them in any way to fight the God of Time?"

 "Okay, but what about Hadrik, then?" Melindra says. "What would he have to gain by contacting his spirit?"

"Nothing," Arraka says. "But that's not the point. What matters is that WE would have something to gain by him contacting his spirit."

"And why would that be?" Melindra says.

"Well," Arraka says, "the second and much more important reason why we want to get in contact with a spirit from the magical plane is that we want to set up a little conflict between the God of Time, the God of Death, and all the other spirits."

"A conflict?..." Melindra says.

"Mhm..." Arraka says. "See, I'm not sure how much attention you've been paying to my discussion with Selkram, but one thing I mentioned when I was talking to him was that I figured out he also tried to absorb other spirits, just like me, in order to gain more power. He failed miserably, and obviously never attempted anything like that again after the first few times, but the other spirits don't know that. In fact, the others likely don't know anything at all about the fact that he and Ulruk tried to absorb spirits, because if they did, they would have tried to throw them out of the magical plane, just like they did with me. It doesn't look like any of the spirits figured out that the multiple voices Selkram and Ulruk gained when they talk are coming from the spirits they absorbed incorrectly, but that would change if I could somehow come into contact with one of the spirits on the magical plane, and spill the beans."

 "But would they believe you?..." Melindra says.

"They would be forced to believe me if I gave them enough proof," Arraka says. "And since I'm the one who invented the technique, I obviously know exactly what they need to test for, in order to convince themselves that the voices are indeed coming from badly absorbed spirits. Once they find this out, it's going to be complete chaos! All of the gods and powerful spirits in the magical realm will start fearing for their own existence, and they will try to rid themselves of both Selkram and Ulruk. This would also force the God of Fate to pick a side in this conflict, and while Memphir may not care much about the God of Time, he most certainly couldn't just turn against the God of Death right in the middle of their alliance. Thus, the three gods would have no choice but to form a new alliance, while making enemies out of every single spirit in the magical plane. The God of Storms and the God of the Seas would most definitely be leading the charge against them, and there are some strong animal and monster spirits too, that could pose quite a challenge for our godly trio."

 "Oh..." Melindra says, while stroking her chin. "So your aim is to have the three gods banished to the earthen plane, then?"

"Nah," Arraka says. "Memphir is the only one who knows the Magium well enough to pull off such a stunt, and even he probably wouldn't have the guts to try something like that again, after what happened to them the last time they did it. Nevertheless, Memphir would almost certainly be forced to join the side of the outcasts, so the most likely scenario is that there would soon be a very long lasting all-out war between the God of Fate, the God of Death, the God of Time, and every other god and spirit in the magical realm. Although I wouldn't put it past the God of Fate to manage to get a few of the other gods on their side even in a situation like this. He's always been a crafty bastard."

"Wait, so if the other gods and spirits will be doing our work for us, why are we still training to fight against the God of Time, then?..." Hadrik says.

"They won't be able to take those three out so easily," Arraka says. "If even I wasn't able to kill them, then the other spirits won't be able to do it either. At most, we can hope for a stalemate. But there's no way Selkram can come out unscathed after a battle like that. He will be greatly weakened, and that's just what we need."

 "I still don't get why Daren and I are the only ones trying to talk to our spirits, though," Hadrik says. "Shouldn't everyone be involved in this, if it's so important? I'm pretty sure that both Kate and Leila have better magical sense than I do."

"And who would they contact, you moron?" Arraka says. "Kate is an artificial mage, so she isn't connected to any spirits, and Leila isn't a mage at all. You and Daren are the only ones in this group who are linked to any magical spirits. Well, technically Flower is linked to Illuna, I guess, but she's not in the magical plane, so she doesn't count."

"Yeah, but I was saying that they should try to contact our spirits, instead of theirs," Hadrik says.

"It doesn't work that way," Arraka says. "I already told you yesterday. You need to contact them by yourselves. If somebody could have done it from the outside then I would have done it myself, since I can already see those damn invisible strings tying you to your spirits as clear as day! Anyway, we're just wasting time arguing about this. Let's move on with the rest of the meeting. Kate, what's your status? Did you manage to magically sharpen your icicles enough to affect those targets I gave you?"

 "No, the icicles just keep passing right through them," Kate says. "I tried sinking a lot of my magical energy into my projectiles to make them as powerful as possible, but it's still not having any effect, no matter how hard I try."

"It's not the power that you need to be focusing on," Arraka says. "It's the sharpness. Let me explain. Those targets I made for you were created from a substance that is similar to the 'solid light' that makes up Selkram's energetic body. In order to be able to directly affect something like that, you need to focus less on the physical aspect of your ice, and more on its aura. When you magically sharpen your projectiles, what you are doing in fact is that you are sharpening the auras of your icicles, not the icicles themselves. It's the same when you use magical sharpening for any other elements. And if the aura is sharp enough, it can affect even a body that is made almost entirely out of energy. That's why no matter how powerful or fast you make your projectiles, it has no meaning unless their aura is good enough."

 Arraka then stays quiet for a second or two, while we all wait patiently for her to resume her train of thought.

"Also," Arraka continues, "keep in mind that those targets I made for you have some physical matter added into them as well, to make it somewhat easier for you. With Selkram, it's going to be way harder than that. Of course, if Melindra were to join us too, things might get a lot simpler. I'm pretty sure that her wind blades are more than sharp enough to destroy my targets, and with a little guidance from me, she might even be able to cut through actual solid light in a matter of days. What do you say, Melindra? Wouldn't you like to take some sweet, sweet revenge on the God of Time after all he did to you?"

"I already told you that I'm not interested," Melindra says. "I only came to this meeting out of curiosity, not to join you in your plans. I don't have a death wish, unlike the rest of the people here."

She pauses.

"But... I suppose I could give Kate some pointers about how she could sharpen her ice better, if she wants..." Melindra continues.

 "Thank you..." Kate says. "I will gladly accept your help."

"You said that aura sharpness is what Kate needs to be focusing on, but what about aura hardening?" Hadrik asks Arraka. "Could I try to hit the God of Time with my fists if I made my aura hard enough?"

"Eh..." Arraka says. "I suppose it theoretically could be possible, but it would certainly be much less effective. You could try punching some of Kate's targets to see how well you're doing, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. So, let's see who was next on the list... I already confirmed that Barry and Leila haven't made any progress in unlocking the stat device's magical stats, so I guess that leaves us with Flower and Illuna, but I already know their progress since I'm always hanging around their neck. Flower, you should just keep focusing on sharpening your element, like Kate. Illuna, you could do that too, but I think you should keep working on those techniques I've taught you, back when I was still your mentor. Sharpening your element will come much more naturally, once you've practiced those techniques well enough."

 "I will keep that in mind," Illuna says.

"Alright," Arraka says. "So we've got Barry who's working on unlocking his magical stats, we've got Kate, Flower and Illuna who are working on their elemental magic, and we've got Daren, whose enchanted sword may well be the only weapon somewhat capable of harming the God of Time right now, but who can't even defend himself from someone throwing a pebble, without covering himself in heavy armor... I love it! This team is so beyond hopeless that if you people actually end up killing Selkram, it would be the most hilarious thing to have ever happened in all of the history of the magical and earthen planes combined. I mean, just imagine the humiliation Selkram would be going through in his final moments, after being beaten by this group of pushovers! I am trembling in excitement at the very idea of it!"

 "Yeah, I have to admit that it would be pretty funny."

"And you know what's even funnier?" Arraka says. "The fact that he would never in a million years suspect you of trying to oppose him in any way. Your stupidity is the perfect camouflage! If nobody messes anything up, we should be able to sabotage him in plain sight and he will never see it coming, until the very last moment."

"So, is this it?..." Melindra says. "Is this your grand plan for taking down the God of Time? Do you people think that doing a little bit of training is all you need, in order to take down a god?"

Arraka laughs.

 "No, this is only the beginning," she says. "In the coming weeks, I will be teaching these shmucks everything they need to know in order to fight Selkram, specifically. I will tell them all his weaknesses, all of his personality quirks, all the ways to provoke him into doing something stupid, and everything else that comes to mind from all of my years of confrontations with him. And also, since we will inevitably need to pass through at least one more of Selkram's rituals before we can openly attack him, one other thing I will be doing is that I'm going to be teaching these losers all they need to know in order to wipe that arrogant, smug, irritating grin off my past self's face, once and for all. I will show that buffoon what it means to mess with someone of my caliber. She will be eradicated from the face of the earth, and it will be this pathetic circus troupe that does her in. I can't think of a more fitting end for that cretin, who refused my benevolent offer and openly tried to threaten me into making me her pet."

"Uh... you do realize that you are talking about yourself right now, don't you?" Hadrik says.

"Myself?" Arraka says. "That sad imitation WISHES she could be me. She may think she's smart, but we'll see who gets the last laugh once I'm done with her."

"Yeah, but if you tell us her weaknesses, wouldn't it mean that you'd be telling us your own weaknesses?..." Hadrik says. "Wouldn't that help us fight you too, instead of just her?"

 "Those weaknesses are from five thousand years ago," Arraka says. "I've found ways to work around most of them since then. And besides, if we ever have a fight again I'd rather it be something more thrilling than just me turning you all into dust in a few seconds. That kind of an anti-climactic battle just kind of ruins all the tension, you know what I mean?"

"We're getting side-tracked again," Illuna says. "Arraka, what was that new plan you said you came up with earlier today, while we were travelling? I thought you had some new important information to give us, aside from our usual progress status routine."

"Oh, yeah!" Arraka says. "Remember how I told you that the next time we're in a ritual, we're going to need to be in complete control of our emotions so we no longer give that bastard all the energy he needs? Well, our efforts will be useless if we don't also coordinate ourselves with all the other groups that received the prophecy after us. We already know that the Sage of the West and his pupil were among these groups, and from what I gathered, some of you met this 'Azarius' on this continent already. So my question is, do you have any means of communicating with him? Maybe a transceiver, given to him by Daren?"

 "How about we get on with the meeting and drop the insults, for a change?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, did you feel insulted by me calling you a pushover?" Arraka says, in a mocking tone. "Should I have used a different wording? Mentally-challenged, perhaps? Nincompoops? Nitwits?

 "No," Daren says. "But I wish I had given him one when I had the chance. I made sure to enchant a lot of these transceivers before coming to Varathia when I heard rumors that they might allow teams in the earlier stages of the tournament, but I wasn't really sure how Azarius would react to me giving him a transceiver out of the blue, especially since he went out of his way to not assemble any sort of team before coming here, unlike the rest of the sages."

"Well, that is unfortunate," Arraka says. "I was hoping that we would at least get a bit of a head start for this part of the plan, but I guess we'll need to do it all from scratch, again. Anyway, ignoring the fact that we have no way of contacting these people, our biggest problem is that aside from Azarius, we have no idea who else was visited by the time weaver. My guess is that Eiden was probably left out of the prophecy this time around, since he will likely be directly involved in triggering the events that are prophesized, so other than him, I can only assume that the prophecy has been given to the strongest groups of mages participating in this tournament, and maybe some of the hotshots from Varathia, like Tyrath, the golden fox, or some of the kings. We can't just throw around guesses, though. We need some solid information. And the only one who could have this information is the time weaver herself."

 "Rose already told us that the only people she remembered visiting after leaving us were Azarius and his pupil," I say. "She said that everything in her head was blurry after that."

"She's the only one who could realistically find out this information without us having to scour the entire continent, asking random people about it. And it's not like we can just skip over this step of the plan, either. Like I told you yesterday, keeping the God of Time from gathering new energy isn't enough. We also need to make him expend as much energy as possible, while he's maintaining these rituals of his. I have a pretty good idea of what sorts of things we could do inside these rituals to force him to spend a lot of energy, but unless everyone else that gets trapped in these rituals does it too, it will just be a waste of time! By the way, what about that other thing we needed from Rose? Is she working on a way to keep Selkram from stealing her time reversal power in the future? Because, you know... there's not much use in fighting someone who can just reverse time to heal his wounds every time he's in a pinch."

 "Rose hasn't even managed to use any of her time powers successfully, yet," I say. "She's been trying to activate them for the past few days, but it's nowhere near as easy as it was when she was connected to the Magium."

"It doesn't matter if she can control her powers or not!" Arraka says. "This is an entirely different matter. Restricting control of her powers to other people should be easier to do than using those powers herself. Tell her that she only needs to figure out where the time reversal power is located in her mind, and to hide it behind a wall that is unbreakable by outside forces."

"Uhm... okay," I say. "I'll tell her that. Not sure how much it will help, but I'll tell her."

"She'll be fine," Arraka says. "If she was smart enough to figure out how to use her time powers while connected to the Magium, she should also be able to figure out what my words mean. It's probably going to take her a while to actually put it all into practice, though."

 "Wow, I'm impressed..." Melindra says. "You really seem to have put a lot of time and effort in this plan of yours, Arraka. I didn't know you had it in you. I've always pegged you as more of an improviser, than a careful planner."

"Arraka is a lot more cunning than she lets on," Illuna says, in a cold tone. "You should never underestimate what she is capable of, even while trapped inside an amulet."

"Now, now, Illuna," Arraka says. "You're almost making it seem as if I were the enemy, here. We're all on the same team, remember? But yes, it most definitely has been a while since I've put so much effort into a plan like this. It feels almost as if I were back in the magical plane, hatching one of my grand schemes to take down the gods and their allies. Of course, things would be going a hell of a lot smoother if I didn't have to carry all this dead-weight with me, but beggars can't be choosers, am I right?"

"Hey," Hadrik says. "I'll have you know that one of these dead-weights you're talking about is going to be the future winner of the Magium tournament!"

He then turns to me, with a grin.

"Isn't that right, Barry?" Hadrik says.

 "Huh?... Oh, yes... Yes, of course!" I say, in a slightly hesitant tone, as Kate turns to look at me, suspiciously.

"Uh-huh," Arraka says. "The winner. Right..."

She remains silent for about two seconds, and then she continues.

"So anyway, there is much more I'd like to discuss with you all about Selkram and his weaknesses, but like I said before, our top priority at the moment should be to get in contact with one of the spirits from the magical plane. Therefore, I will spend the remainder of this meeting trying to teach Daren and Hadrik the basics of auras, in the hopes that we can actually make some meaningful progress, this time around. Everyone else is dismissed. You can go tend to your own tasks regarding Selkram, or whatever it is you want to do. Daren, Hadrik, come over here. We've got work to do."

As everyone is moving away from the meeting area, I get ready to leave as well, but just as I take my first step Kate places herself in front of me, blocking my path, while looking at me with a very serious expression on her face.

 I try to walk past Kate but she steps to the side, in order to block my path once again. We do this two more times, until I'm eventually forced to ask her what's going on.

"Are you going to let me pass, or...?" I say.

"No, I am not," Kate says, simply.

"And the reason is...?" I say.

Kate just looks at me with the same serious expression on her face for about two seconds, before she speaks again.

"Why did you hesitate earlier, when Hadrik said you would be the one to win this tournament?" Kate asks me.

"Oh..." I say, as I take a few seconds to collect my thoughts, before I answer her question. "That was just... he caught me by surprise, that's all. I was in deep thought about Arraka's strategies, and it took me a while before I realized Hadrik was talking to me. Is it really so strange for me to hesitate answering a question, that you'd need to go out of your way to ask me about it?"

 "Could you perhaps move aside, so I can pass?" I say.

"No, I cannot," Kate says, simply.

 "Listen, if you want to confess your feelings for me, this might not be the best place."

"I see that you still haven't lost your 'unique' sense of humor," Kate says. "That is good, in a way. It shows that there are at least some parts of you that remain unchanged. It is the parts that HAVE changed that worry me, however."

"What are you talking about?" I say, trying to feign ignorance. "Nothing has changed. I'm still the same guy I've always been."

"Then why did you hesitate earlier, when Hadrik said you would be the one to win this tournament?" Kate asks me.

"Oh..." I say, as I take a few seconds to collect my thoughts, before I answer her question. "That was just... he caught me by surprise, that's all.

 "No," Kate says. "But this isn't the only time when you've acted out of the ordinary in the past few days. You've been behaving strangely ever since those rituals. Even if you are still trying to act like your old, nonchalant self, in order to avoid arousing any suspicion, it is as clear as day that you are only pretending. You used to have this sort of... stubborn ignorance regarding any sort of obstacle that would realistically be impossible to surpass. It was neither courage, nor a lack of fear. It was something else. It seemed as if your previous self was literally incapable of processing the very notion of danger. But now you are different. Somehow, you've become able to understand what danger truly is, and it's eating you up inside."

She then pauses for a few seconds, and she frowns at me, while looking directly into my eyes.

"So, are you planning to talk about it, or are you just going to keep pretending that nothing has happened?" Kate says.

"Wow..." I say. "You really managed to read me like an open book, didn't you? I suppose there's not much use in hiding it any longer, if you were already able to figure out this much on your own. Let's... head over to those two rocks over there, and I'll tell you what you want to know."

Kate and I both start walking towards two big rocks, facing each other, which are still on top of the hill we were on, but far from where Daren, Hadrik and Arraka are having their training session. Once we reach the rocks, we each lean with our backs against them, as Kate crosses her arms, looking at me intently.

"Yes, I remember," Kate says.

"Well, it turns out that the real story of what happened was a little different," I say. "I only realized this in the ritual, when the God of Time forced me to relive my past, but the fact of the matter is that I was never too late to save my parents from the banshee. I was right there, watching them get killed, but I was too scared to do anything about it and I simply froze up in fear. It was only when the banshee tried to kill my brother as well, that I finally managed to muster up the courage to attack her.

"Somehow, I must have felt such a strong need to never freeze up in fear again, that I subconsciously eliminated my survival instincts from my decision making process. But now that I realize what happened, it's a little harder for me to maintain the same attitude from before. I just can't help but ask myself if the decisions I'm making are really okay, or if it's only my defective instincts kicking in again, clouding my judgment..."

"Is this why you were hesitant in answering Hadrik, earlier?" Kate says. "Are you starting to have second thoughts about your reasons for joining this tournament?"

"No!" I blurt out at first, but then I take a few seconds to reconsider my words. "I mean... I don't think so... I still want to win and become a mage. It's just that..."

I pause, not knowing exactly what to say.

 "It's just that you are no longer so certain that you can achieve the impossible, like before?" Kate says.

"It's more than that," I say. "I don't even know if the prize I'm seeking is really what I thought it was, anymore. I have no idea if there's any way to use the Magium to grant me magical powers. I'm not even sure if I still WANT the Magium. All of the legends used to say that it was supposed to be the source of all magic, but I think it's much more than that. We almost got erased from existence, solely because Arraka chose her words wrong while we were in the Magium's territory. Even if I gained access to the Magium, what then?... How would I even know how to use it? There's no way I could ever learn how to manipulate that strange world with the same confidence that Arraka did. And to make matters worse, one simple mistake from my part could lead to my instant obliteration. If I somehow won the tournament and could freely use the Magium, how would I even know where to begin?"

 "Didn't you tell us that you were supposed to have some innate understanding of the Magium, thanks to having lessathi blood in your veins?" Kate says. "Or at least you should, according to Arraka's theory. If that were true, then you might have a greater chance to get some real use out of the Magium than the mages that joined the tournament."

"Yes," I say, "but I used to think that the Magium was the source of all magic. In that context, it wouldn't have been unrealistic to assume that I could use it to make me into a mage. But now that I've seen what the Magium is capable of... I'm not even sure if I want to use it anymore. Just the thought of going back into that world is making my hair stand up on the back of my neck."

"Then don't use the Magium," Kate says. "You already have the solution to your problem right there, in your pocket. You can use your stat booster to become a mage. You only need to find a way to unlock your magical stats, and then you won't even need the Magium anymore."

"That would only work while I'm here, in this tournament," I say. "Once there will no longer be mages around me to power up the device, the energy will slowly deplete by itself, until the stat booster will become completely unusable."

 "But what if you tried to use the knowledge from the Magium to alter your stat device?" Kate says. "From what Arraka said, I'm guessing that it's somehow possible to access the Magium even if you don't enter its world. Surely, amongst all that knowledge, there would also be a way to make your stat device gain its energy directly from the magical plane instead of getting it from other mages, don't you think?"

"I... think you might be right!" I say, as I suddenly jump up from the rock I was leaning against. "Yes... Why didn't I think of that? Even without knowing what exactly the Magium is, I still should be able to at the very least get some knowledge from it. And given my advantage of being a half-lessathi, I might actually be able to make my own version of a stat device, with enough practice. That's brilliant!"

"So, should I take it that you've now gained back some of your motivation for winning this competition?" Kate says, as she raises an eyebrow, while still leaning with her back against the rock.

"Yes, definitely!" I say.

"Good," Kate says. "Maybe now you'll be able to finally focus more on our goals, than on your own internal turmoil. It was getting tiresome to look at your depressed face all day."

 As she becomes less tense, I can see that she has a very tired look in her eyes, as if she's been overexerting herself for a long while, even though we haven't had any fights in the past few days.

"I've had a little trouble sleeping, lately, but nothing too serious," Kate says, as she continues to look to her side. "It's been three days already, so I've mostly gotten over it by now."

"It really doesn't look like you've gotten over it to me!" I say. "If I didn't know any better, I'd think you've been battling an army of dragons by yourself for hours on end, judging by how tired you look right now."

Kate frowns at me.

She pauses.

 Having finished our conversation, Kate and I go past the place where Arraka was training Daren and Hadrik, and then we slowly begin to climb down the hill so we can reach our camp. 

When we get close to the tents, we see that Leila was sitting on a rock next to a tree stump, which she likely wants to use as a makeshift table on which we can place my stat device while she works on it. Kate goes on ahead in the direction of her tent, while I take my stat booster out of my pocket and put it on the tree stump, so Leila and I can continue our work from where we left off yesterday.

"Sorry it took so long," I tell Leila. "Kate had a few things to discuss with me, so I couldn't come down right away."

"It's not a problem," Leila writes, while smiling. "I'm glad that you two finally found the time to have a discussion in private. I'm guessing that she finally approached you about your sudden change in attitude from the last few days?"

"Uh... yes," I say. "Yes, exactly. How did you know? Did you already talk to Kate about this?" 

 Leila shakes her head.

"No," she writes. "But I could see the uneasiness in her eyes whenever she noticed that you weren't acting like your usual self, and knowing Kate, I figured that she would confront you directly about this sooner or later. So, how was your discussion? Did Kate manage to help you out in some way?"

"Yeah..." I say. "She definitely did."

"That's good to hear!" Leila writes. "Honestly, I wasn't really sure if you'd be open to speak about your ritual with her, given how everyone's been completely avoiding talking about this subject in the past few days. I realize that each one of us was affected by these trials in a different way, but sometimes it's better to get these things off your chest, than to keep bottling them up inside."

"You mean like how you told me and Kate about your ritual, the day after the prophecy?" I say.

Leila nods.

"I was surprised that more people didn't feel the need to talk about it," Leila writes. "I would have thought that most people would want to discuss these things with friends, instead of trying to pretend that nothing happened..."

 "Yeah..." I say, as I gaze contemplatively into the distance. "I guess this goes to show that despite everything we've been through together, at the end of the day we're still just a bunch of strangers who've only known each other for a little over two weeks since this tournament started. It's not like we've been travelling together for a lifetime, so that we'd be comfortable enough to talk about this sort of stuff without hesitation. And besides, most of the people in our group are either the types that don't like to burden other people with their problems, or the types that don't want to appear weak by showing they can be affected by such things. If we're ever going to have heart to heart discussions about how these rituals impacted us, it will probably happen slowly, and only after everyone has already managed to deal with their problems by themselves."

"I guess you're right," Leila writes. "Not everyone is going to be comfortable opening up to people they've only known for a short while. But perhaps these things will change, with time..."

She pauses.

"Anyway," Leila writes, "I think we should start working on your stat device. Maybe we'll get lucky and actually make a bit of progress today, before we go to sleep."

 We spent the next two hours trying to fiddle with my stat booster, in order to see if we could somehow unlock the three hidden aura stats that Arraka told me about during our meeting. Given that we didn't want to disturb Daren during his training session with Arraka, we initially tried to make do with the enchanting tools we had already gotten from him two days ago, when we started working on figuring out the secret code required to activate the magical stats. Once Daren came down from the hill, however, we asked him if he could give us some more appropriate tools, because the ones we were using before were better suited for our previous task of cracking codes, and not so useful for our new goal of finding hidden menus.

With the help of Daren and with Leila's knowledge of magical devices from her father, we eventually managed to discover the hidden menus that Arraka was talking about, but now we were facing a new challenge, as the only method Daren and Leila could come up with for unlocking these hidden stats was a risky one, which may even render my device completely useless if we got unlucky.

 "No matter how long I think about this, I'm not seeing another option," Daren says, as he is holding two sharp metal tools in his hands, using them to manipulate the aura around my stat device. "I'm not sure if Leila's father could come up with a better idea than this, but I can't think of any other way of unlocking these extra stats than to break the seal placed on them by force. The problem is that if there is some sort of security measure in place to prevent such a thing from happening, your stat device may go into an emergency lockdown mode which could completely prevent you from using your regular stats until the lockdown is deactivated. If that happens, then fiddling with the device further without having a very deep understanding of how its mechanisms work could cause it to break completely. Maybe it would indeed be better to wait for Leila's father and see if he has some other ideas, before we go any further with this plan."

He then moves the two sharp metal tools some more in the air above the stat booster, and he stops after a few seconds, looking at the device intently.

"Here we go," Daren says, as he brings both of the metal tools together and he touches my device with them.

As soon as he does this, the screen of my device turns red, and all it says is 'Warning! Security breach! For your safety, this device has been locked until one of the designers can take a look at it and unlock it manually."

 "Well..." Daren says, as he looks at my shocked face. "You can't say I didn't warn you. Like I said before, if we try to mess with it even more now, we might risk breaking it completely. We no longer have any other choice than to wait until we reach Ollendor and hope that Leila's father can fix this somehow. He spent a lot of time modifying Leila's stat device so with a little luck, he might also know a way to cancel the lockdown. You're just going to have to live without a functional stat booster for a day or two, until we actually find him."

Unfortunately, neither Daren's expertise in enchanting nor Leila's knowledge about magical devices that she got from her father were anywhere near enough for us to be able to make any noticeable progress.

He is sitting on the ground at the base of the hill, in a place where we can oversee our camp without being too far away from it, so that we would be able to reach the tents quickly in case of an emergency.

"Hold on, Barry," Daren tells me, just as I reach him. "Could you stand in place there for a few seconds and not move? I'm trying to test something."

"Uh, sure, I guess..." I say, as I stop moving and look at him confused.

He then stares at me for a while, with a very concentrated look on his face.

 I turn around again, making sure that he has a good view of me from the side this time. After about ten more seconds, Daren still doesn't seem to have found what he was looking for, and he makes yet another request of me.

"Could you turn back to face me again?" Daren says. "And maybe take two steps to the front? Actually no, forget what I said! I need you to step further back. Just start walking slowly backwards and I'll tell you when to stop."

"Seriously, man, are you planning to tell me what you're trying to accomplish here, or will we just keep doing this all night?" I say, as I turn to face him.

He then pauses for a little while, looking somewhat embarrassed by what he is about to say.

"I was trying to see if I could detect the fact that you are a half-lessathi, just from the flow of your aura," Daren says. "Arraka showed me how to do it earlier today, but I still think I'm missing something..."

"You are using your own free time to practice something that you've learned from Arraka?..." I ask him, stupefied. "You?!"

 "Hey, you don't have to act so shocked about it!" Daren says. "I've been practicing before today too, haven't I?"

"Yeah, but never during your free time!" I say. "You were only doing it during the daily time intervals we've all agreed to spend on honing our skills, in preparation for our inevitable battle against the God of Time. And even then, you seemed to be doing everything half-assedly, without taking any of it seriously."

"That's because I didn't think Arraka would actually give us genuinely good advice!" Daren says. "When I heard her say all that nonsensical-sounding stuff about the auras the first time, I could have sworn she was pulling our leg. I didn't expect her to actually be serious about any of this. It was only after I saw that 'waterfall' in the aura above people's heads that I realized she wasn't fooling around, like she usually does."

"Huh..." I say, in a thoughtful voice. "That's funny. I could have sworn that your real reason for not wanting to follow Arraka's advice was because she's evil, and you suspected she had ulterior motives for wanting to help us."

Even if they help you completely out of the blue, it might still just be something they decided to do on a whim, or for a reason that is merely selfish, but not insincere.

 "Want me to do a little dance too, while I'm at it?" I tell Daren, as I turn around to face him.

"Sadly, my dwarven dance teacher forgot to show me how to do that one," I say. "But seriously, are you planning to tell me what you're trying to accomplish here, or will we just keep doing this all night?"

 "I'm... not sure if Eiden's only reason was to humiliate you," I say.

"What do you mean?" Daren asks me. "What other reason could he have had?"

"Well," I say, "I mean sure... maybe that might have been his goal at first, but when you got on your hands and knees and told him you'd do anything he wanted, no matter how humiliating, he didn't ask anything from you, remember?"

"Oh, you saw that scene..." Daren says, looking somewhat embarrassed. "Yeah, now that I think about it, you're right. When I told him I'd do anything, I thought he'd jump right at the opportunity, but he gave me the power just like that, without asking for anything in return. Actually no, he did ask for something... He asked me to 'prove him wrong'. What do you suppose he meant by that?"

"He was almost certainly talking about your previous argument with him," I say. "Don't you remember? When you first met, you told him that there is still some good worth fighting for, and that as long as you don't give up, you will find a way to right the world's wrongs. That was what started your whole feud with him. So maybe after he saw you throwing yourself on your hands and knees in front of your worst enemy just for the sake of saving one slave girl, he might have had a slight change of heart. When he asked you to prove him wrong, I think he wanted you to show him through your actions during this tournament that there is indeed still hope for humanity like you said, and that he made a mistake by giving up on all humans the way he did."

 "No..." Daren says, in disbelief. "That can't be what he meant. Eiden has lost his humanity a long time ago. He might have had good intentions at some point, but that was hundreds of years ago! You've seen the way he acts. He considers humans to be nothing more than insects. He even said this himself. There's no way he'd be having second thoughts now, after all this time."

"Are you sure about that?" I say. "Because if we are to judge him by how he reacted when I told him I'd save all the cities in Varathia, I'd say the situation might be quite different. I think that deep down he wants to be wrong, but it's way too late for him to turn back now. That's why he is giving us one last chance to do what he couldn't do, before everything goes down the drain, for good."

"Oh, boy..." Daren says. "I had completely forgotten about how you said you'd solve all of Varathia's problems by yourself too. Between winning the tournament, killing the God of Time and saving the cities, you sure have a busy schedule ahead of you, don't you, Barry?..."

"Hey, you know me!" I say, trying to appear as confident as possible. "It's all in the day's work!"

 "What the hell?..." Daren says. "Did you hit yourself in the head or something? I could swear that I heard some hesitation in your voice just now!"

"What are you talking about?" I say. "Of course I wasn't hesitating! I never hesitate. Maybe you're the one who hit himself in the head, instead of me."

"Right..." Daren says, as he looks at me suspiciously. "Listen, if you think that your plan of fixing all the problems in Varathia is too reckless, then you don't have to go through with it. We already know from the prophecy that we will have the possibility to save the cities from destruction either way, so you don't need to rely on Eiden's generosity. In fact, it might be better if we didn't take his word for granted at all, because who knows when he might change his mind... And even if you are right about him and he does truly wish to be wrong about his stance on humanity, I don't think he will make life any easier for us when we walk through those cities. In fact, I am almost certain that he will be doing everything he can to make things as hard as possible for us, in order to both 'test' us and amuse himself at the same time. We might be better off just focusing on the prophecy for now, and dealing with the cities after one of us gains access to the Magium."

 "You're right. We already have enough things to worry about as it is."

"Don't worry," Daren says. "Once we get access to the Magium, I'm certain it will be much easier to fix whatever it is that needs to be fixed in those cities. If these things have been going on in Varathia for so long, then they can wait a few more weeks until the tournament is over."

"Leaving the cities of Varathia aside," I say, "I think what's more important to discuss right now is whether you're done with your aura practice yet, because I'm getting kinda tired of just standing here in place."

"Oh right, sorry about that..." Daren says. "I just need to check up on a few more things, but I'm going to need you to turn around a few more times before I'm done. The flow of your aura is different behind your back from how it is in the front, and it's too difficult for me to make out the differences if I don't see it from the right angle."

"Alright, well make sure you hurry up, then," I say. "This is getting a little uncomfortable."

After spending ten whole minutes trying to analyze my aura, Daren finally gave up and said that he would ask Arraka some more questions tomorrow, to clarify once more what exactly he was supposed to be looking for. The rest of our night shift was rather uneventful and we mostly just discussed various things from our lives before coming to Varathia, in order to pass the time.

 Ever since that day when we fought the Sage of the North, Melindra has begun to interact a lot more normally with the group, and she even offered to take some night shifts every now and then. While she still hasn't completely gotten over her habit of provoking reactions from people for her own amusement, the others have begun to understand that there is no ill-intent behind her actions, so nowadays they mostly just brush her off whenever she is up to her old antics. From what I've seen, Flower and I are still the ones that Melindra trusts the most in our group, but she is definitely acting a lot more relaxed around the others than she used to.

We left Hadrik and Melindra just as they were about to start a game of cards, and we each went to our tents so we could enjoy some sleep for the rest of the night. 

When I woke up the next morning, I went to eat some breakfast made by Flower, and after we were all done with our food we resumed our journey, with Melindra taking the lead as always.

Not long after our departure, Daren began to ask Arraka various technical questions about how to analyze auras, to the shock of everybody else around him. Seeing that he wasn't planning to shut up by himself, Arraka eventually decided to stop ignoring Daren, and to address him directly.

"Have you gone daft?" Arraka says. "Our training session isn't scheduled until later this evening. Why the hell are you asking me all these questions now?"

 "Because what you told me doesn't make any sense!" Daren says, exasperated. "How am I supposed to find the right flow line in Barry's aura when there are a million of them, and they all look exactly the same?"

"What do you mean they look the same?" Arraka says. "Each and every one of them is completely different. Even their movements are more or less independent from each other. Are you really THAT stupid? How much do I need to dumb this down for you so that I won't feel like talking to a brick wall?"

"I think you should start with learning how to detect the aura of a regular lessathi first, Daren," Flower says, in an uncharacteristically serious tone. "Even Arraka thought Barry was a normal lessathi at first, and you know how good she is with auras. If this isn't the kind of difference that she can tell at a glance, without specifically looking for it, then you have no chance of finding it on your first try. Illuna can tell the difference between a lessathi and a human's aura, so maybe she could explain it to you in terms that are easier to understand."

"I told you that there is no need for you to call me by my real name!" Illuna says. "You can just keep calling me Petal, like you always do."

"Whatever you say, Illuna," Flower says.

"Ugh..." Illuna says. "Do what you will."

"Wait, you two are still fighting since yesterday evening?..." I say.

"We're not fighting," Flower says, simply.

 "The clown girl does have a point," Arraka says. "Maybe having Illuna tutor him for a while, until he is able to sense lessathi auras would be a better idea for now. If nothing else, at least it would make him stop pestering me with all these inane questions. Luckily, we also have a regular lessathi in the team, so he won't be lacking test subjects for his practice sessions."

"Test subjects?" Leila writes, with a bit of apprehension in her eyes.

"He only needs to analyze your aura, so you won't need to do anything other than turn around a few times for him to get a better look," I tell Leila. "At most you're going to get a little dizzy, but nothing more than that."

"Oh, okay..." Leila writes, looking more relieved. "I can do that."

"So, uh..." Daren says, as he looks hesitantly towards Flower. "Illuna, do you have some time, or?..."

 Flower's eyes turn blue all of a sudden, as Illuna looks at Daren for a few seconds before answering.

"Come here," Illuna says, eventually. "We'll see what I can show you until we reach the city."

We travelled for a few more hours before Melindra finally told us that we were getting close to our destination. During this time, Daren has been practicing his aura reading skills with the help of Illuna and Leila, although from what I've seen, progress has been a little slow.

When Daren finally decided to take a break, Flower took advantage of this opportunity to ask Melindra about the new rocks she's added to her collection in the past few days.

While Melindra was busy showing Flower her rocks, Daren decided to do one final check to see if we all still remembered our infiltration plans for the city, which we'd discussed at length during the previous day.

"Alright, so everyone knows what we need to do once we reach Ollendor, right?" Daren says.

As Melindra pulled out one of the rocks from her backpack in order to show it to Flower, I couldn't help but notice that it had a few barely visible, very small symbols engraved on its surface, which I would have normally ignored if they didn't also happen to be written in one of the ancient languages that I've been taught by my stat device. I did not need to ask Melindra for a closer look at the rock, because she rotated it in all the possible angles while showing it to Flower, which gave me more than enough time to read the text on it. Apparently, the symbols were written in a very old dialect of the goblin language, and the meaning behind them was: 'The password is griffin beak.'

The words didn't exactly tell me anything, but who knows? Maybe I'll find some use for this information later.

"Well, we asked you to join us a million times, but you just kept putting us off, so we eventually had to do a meeting without you!" Daren says. "It's not like we could just start planning these things after we'd already reached the city."

"Why not?" Melindra asks, confused. "Wouldn't it have been a better idea to wait and see the city's defenses, before you made any concrete plans?"

"Well, yeah sure, but it's not like we don't already have a general idea of what we might be going up against," Daren says. "I mean, we've already seen Thilias' defenses, so I'm guessing that Ollendor can't be that much different."

"Oh, I assure you that Ollendor is quite different when it comes to their defenses," Melindra says.

"Then why don't you just tell us these differences, so we can adjust our plans accordingly?" Daren asks her.

"Because it would be more difficult for me to explain, than to simply show it to you," Melindra says. "You'll understand once we get there."

 "Well, if worst comes to worst, Melindra could just fly us over the walls like she did in Thilias, right?" Hadrik says. "It's not like a few crossbowmen are going to stop us."

"We should be in sight of the city walls in a few minutes, and then you'll have your answer," Melindra says. "Now please stop talking so I can focus on these rocks. I want to finish showing them to Flower before we reach Ollendor."

We do as Melindra says and we keep quiet for the next few minutes, until she is done showcasing all of her rocks. After she puts them in her backpack, Melindra tells us that we will be seeing Ollendor as soon as we pass the line of willows in front of us.

"So, do you all remember when I told you that in Ollendor, they are still preserving old relics from the lessathi empire's days of glory?" Melindra says.

"Yeah, you did say something like that when we were in the second stage of the God of Time's ritual," Daren says. "Why do you ask?"

 "Well..." Melindra says, and then she pushes away the willow branches in front of us, so we can get out of the forest.

What we see when we walk out of the woods stuns us briefly, as we all just gaze in complete shock at the city that can be seen in the distance, in front of us. Just like Melindra told us, it looks like the ruins of the black seredium towers that used to gather magical energy for the old lessathi empire are still being preserved, but what she omitted to tell us was that they are apparently still functional, even in this state of decay.

In a similar fashion to how it all worked five thousand years ago, these towers have flying platforms on each side of them which carry mages across their various levels, and on top of each of the ruined towers there is a purple-colored yarn of magical energy that is moving chaotically in every direction. Someone must have restored these towers somehow, but not to their full functionality, because their size is at least four times smaller than the towers we saw during the ritual, and the energy they are radiating is nowhere near as impressive as the one from five thousand years ago.

 That being said, it looks like even this smaller amount of energy is more than enough to power up all of the magical contraptions they could possibly need. The air above the city is being filled with flying metal vehicles, the large holographic screens in the sky that we saw in the old lessathi empire are also present, and aside from all that, there seem to be quite a few twenty-foot tall metal golems that are patrolling the area around the city, ready to attack any unwanted intruders. As we look at the city in front of us with our jaws dropped, a lonely bird innocently tries to fly over the walls, so it can get to the other side.

Just as it passes the wall, one of the golems immediately turns its head towards it, and it sends a huge beam of fire flying out of its mouth which incinerates its target instantly, leaving only ashes in the air where the bird once was.

While the rest of us are simply staring in front of us in disbelief, it is Hadrik who breaks the silence, by asking Melindra a question.

"So..." Hadrik says. "I'm guessing that's a 'no' on the plan to fly us over the walls, then?"
