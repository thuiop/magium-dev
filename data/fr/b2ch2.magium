"Listen, Arraka," Daren says, as we walk towards the arena. "Are you absolutely sure that the Eiden you've fought during the still winter is the same person as the one we're dealing with now? I mean, it's been six hundred years, right? No one would blame you if you were to make a confusion after all this time!"

"Damn it, this is the third time you've asked me this exact same question," Arraka says. "Yes, it's the same Eiden from six hundred years ago. Get it through your thick skull, already!"

"Daren, why are you finding this so hard to believe?" Kate says. "We already knew that he was six hundred years old and that he was an old acquaintance of Arraka and the golden fox. Given his power, it wasn't that big of a stretch to assume that he was the one who defeated Arraka all that time ago."

"It's not the fact that he could beat Arraka that I find hard to believe," Daren says. "It's the fact that he is known as the founder of this continent's civilization when all we've seen him do so far is wreak havoc, for the sole purpose of his amusement!"

"People change over time," Kate says. "Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Eiden tell you when you first met that the reason he is keeping his eyes closed is because he got tired of seeing the ugliness of humanity? You've seen the way he acted around the earl and the ambassador of Ollendor. It's clear that he no longer holds anything other than disgust and disdain for the inhabitants of Varathia."

 "Leaving Eiden aside," I say, "shouldn't we rather be discussing our plans for the arena?"

"Don't worry about the arena!" Hadrik says. "I alone should be more than enough to deal with whatever the ambassador can throw at us!"

"Oh, yeah?" I say. "And what if they separate us?"

"Barry makes a good point," Daren says. "The first thing we need to make sure of is that we can still communicate with each other, even if they decide to throw us in different cells."

Daren takes off his backpack, and then he takes three transceivers out of it.

"Kate, Hadrik, Flower, take these," he says, as he gives each one of them a transceiver. "Barry, you already have a transceiver. I don't think I've shown you this before, but you have a dial on the right side of your transceiver that you can use to change your calling frequency, in order to match the signature frequency of one of the other transceivers. Does everyone see the dial I'm talking about?"

"Yes," we all answer.

"Good," Daren says. "Each of the transceivers is assigned a number, which corresponds to its own unique signature frequency. Make sure you memorize everyone else's number so you'll know who to contact, when the need arises. The numbers are engraved on the back of the transceivers."

 I look at the back of my transceiver and see that I am assigned the number 'two'. When we exchange our numbers, I learn that Kate was number three, Flower was four, and Hadrik was five.

"Alright," Daren says. "Now you all know your numbers. As an aside, if you ever need to communicate with transceivers that weren't enchanted by me, there's a small button next to the dial which you can use to switch to normal frequencies. I'll be using the transceiver with the number 'six'."

"What about number 'one'?" I ask.

 Daren pauses for a few seconds.

"That's the number of the transceiver I was using originally," Daren says, in a low voice. "The one I gave to Rose."

"Oh," I say, and then we all stay silent for a few moments.

"So, uh, do we know for sure that they're going to allow us to keep our transceivers after we get sent to our cells?" Hadrik asks.

"You will be allowed to keep any items you wish," the king's servant says, having overheard our discussion. "You will each have your own personal cells in which you can store your belongings, but you will be allowed to carry items with you as well."

"What about weapons?" Daren asks. "Are we allowed to use our own weapons and armor during the fights in the arena?"

"Yes, as long as your weapons don't cast any spells, you are allowed to use any weapons you have at your disposal," the servant says.

"What do you understand by 'casting spells'?" I ask. "Would an item that enhances your physical abilities be considered 'spell casting'?"

The servant smiles.

"Yes, I am familiar with it," he says. "Do not worry. The stat booster's effect does not count as spell casting. The magic detectors in the arenas will most definitely ignore it."

"Hey, Barry," Daren says, and both the king's servant and I turn our heads towards him.

"How long can we delay our trip to the arena?" Daren says, looking at the king's servant. "Can it wait half an hour? I was thinking that I could cast some basic sharpness and durability enchantments on my friends' daggers, if I find a shop that sells elven steel along the way."

"There is enough time," the king's servant says. "If you're looking for a shop that sells enchanting materials, there should be one in the marketplace we'll be reaching shortly."

"Why do you need elven steel, specifically?" I ask Daren.

"Elven steel is the best quality steel that money can buy," Daren says, "and basic enchantments like sharpness and durability are highly dependent on the quality of the materials used for enchantment."

"Is there any chance you could enchant my crossbow as well?" I ask.

 "You are not allowed to use ranged weapons within the arenas of Varathia," the king's servant says.

"I'll be honest with you, Barry," Daren tells me, "even if ranged weapons were allowed, I would still not recommend getting your crossbow enchanted. It would be much better to buy a new one. Basic enchantment just isn't a good substitute for poor craftsmanship. With daggers, it's different, because the quality of the metal is much more important than the way the blade was made."

"Why do you keep talking about basic enchantments?" Hadrik says. "Aren't you supposed to be one of the most skilled enchanters in the world? Why don't you just cast some of those crazy enchantments you have on your sword on Barry and Kate's daggers?"

Daren frowns at him.

"The more advanced the enchantment, the more time and resources it requires," he says. "It would take me weeks to cast the enchantments I used on my sword, and it would cost a small fortune to acquire the needed materials. I doubt that I'll be doing anything other than basic enchantments for the duration of this tournament. Barry, Kate, give me your daggers. I will enchant them both as soon as we reach that shop."

 During this time, I used my transceiver to contact Rose, and to tell her that we wouldn't make it home in time for dinner tonight. She was shocked at first, but after she heard the whole story, she was relieved that we were at least given a chance to free ourselves. She then promised me that she will be there, in the audience, to cheer for us when the time comes.

 After Daren got out of the shop, he first gave Kate her dagger, and then he stopped in front of me, with his hand held out, looking as if he were expecting some sort of payment.

"That will be ten gold coins," Daren says. "You can pay it with money from the Western Continent if you want."

"You're charging me money?" I ask him, a little surprised.

"Well, what did you expect?" Daren says. "It's not like I was given all that elven steel for free, you know."

"But you didn't ask Kate for any money!" I say.

"That's because I didn't happen to see her pocketing a few dozen expensive gems in a certain ogre fortress a few days ago," Daren says. "You, on the other hand, should have money to spare."

"So, that's how it is," I say, with a grin.

"Cough it up," Daren says, with his hand still held out.

"Fine, fine," I say, as I place ten gold coins into Daren's palm, and then take back my dagger.

 It took us about two more hours to get from the marketplace to the arenas. Once we reached our destination, we waved goodbye to the king's servant, and then we went inside a small building near the arena which we were told was the 'main office'. The room we entered looked more like the inside of a prison, than an office, but there was a man sitting at a desk in front of us, who seemed to be arranging some papers when we came in. The man paid us no mind until he finished what he was doing, and then he got up and greeted us with a curt nod.

"I was told that you'd be coming here tonight," he says, in a disinterested tone. "Only three of you will be participating, am I correct?"

"Four," Hadrik says, with a wide grin, as he hands his admission letter from the king to the desk worker.

"I see," the desk worker says, after he reads the letter. "Very well, then. Given that I am the only one who is still working at this late hour, I will have to ask you to wait patiently in this lobby, while I lead each one of you to your individual cells."

Kate doesn't look like she fully believes him, but she decides to not press the matter any further.

 "Can't we just all go at once?" Hadrik asks.

"No," the desk worker says. "The ambassador of Ollendor insisted that neither of you are to know the locations of each other's cells. He also made sure that you are each placed into separate divisions, so that you cannot work together during the arena events."

"Divisions?" Daren asks, confused.

"We'll start with the lessathi," the desk worker says, ignoring Daren.

He walks to a door behind him, and he turns to me.

"This way," he says.

I take one last look at everyone else, and then I go to follow the desk worker.

"Good luck, Barry!" Flower shouts, as I head through the door. "Petal and I will be cheering for you from the audience! And I'm sure Arraka will too!"

Once the door closes behind me, I start to walk slowly behind the desk worker, as we both begin to make our way down a very long flight of stairs. We didn't exchange any words while we traversed the dark corridors beneath the arenas. With all of the twists and turns we took, it was hard to tell if I could still find my way back by myself. The torches inside the underground tunnels were dimly lit, and all of the doors looked the same. After a long period of silence, the desk worker finally chooses to speak.

 "There are currently two empty cells left in your division," he says. "Cell number three and cell number five. They are located on opposite sides of the recreational area. I haven't been ordered to place you in any specific cell of the two. Which one would you prefer?"

"I don't know," I say. "What's the difference between the two of them?"

"There is no difference," the desk worker says, bluntly.

"No difference at all?" I ask.

"None whatsoever."

"So, why are you asking me, then?"

 The room I am now finding myself in is only being lit by a few candles. The recreational area appears to be empty, except for one particularly bulky man, wearing leather armor, who is now steadily approaching me. 

"I've been waiting for you," the man says, in a menacing tone. "I heard that they'd be bringing you in tonight."

"Do I know you?" I ask him, confused.

"No, I don't see why you would," the bulky man says, as he stops a few feet in front of me. "I don't know who you are either."

"Then why were you waiting for me?" I say.

"Because I've heard the guards talking," the man says. "They were talking about a group of mages who killed the earl of Ollendor, and I heard them say that a member of that group would be sent to our division tonight. I'll have to admit that I wasn't expecting a stillwater."

I remain silent. There would be no point in correcting him. I'd much rather have everyone think I'm an all-powerful stillwater than give away the fact that I'm not a mage at all.

"It doesn't matter, though," the bulky man continues. "You may as well be one of the four sages, for all the good it will do you. Magic is not allowed in here. I could very well crush your puny head with my bare hands and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it."

"Now, why would you want to do that?" I ask him. "Aren't we supposed to be part of the same team?"

 The man's face contorts into a snarl at the sound of my words.

"Do you have any idea what you've done, you little bastard?" the man shouts.

"Nope," I say. "No idea whatsoever. Why don't you explain it to me?"

"Oh, I'll explain it to you," the man says, grinding his teeth. "Your little stunt with that noble has sealed all of our fates. I heard the guards saying that the next arena event will be the greatest in all the history of Varathia. They're not expecting any of us to make it out alive. They are sending us all to our deaths, just to make sure that they also kill you in the process."

The man is now clenching his fist so hard that blood is starting to drip out of it. While the two of us were talking, the doors leading to the individual cells were opening one by one, and people who had been woken up by the sound of the bulky man's voice were now stepping out of their rooms, to watch the show.

"The only reason why I came to Thilias," the bulky man says, "was because I heard the gnome king would rarely let the arena events in his city endanger the lives of the gladiators. I came here because I thought there was some easy money to be made. But now?... Now I'm just sitting here, waiting for my execution. Cursing my fate. Cursing you!"

 "Why don't you just leave, then?" I say.

"You think I didn't try?!" the man shouts, even louder than before. "The owner of the arena isn't letting any of us go. It's the first time in years when he's being allowed to make the show as deadly as he wants. Do you know that he's been collecting rare beasts and keeping them in the underground tunnels for the past ten years, waiting for a chance to parade them in front of an audience? Well, now that he's finally been given permission, the man is planning to make us fight every single one of them! He wants to make this the crowning moment of his career. He doesn't care about what the king of Thilias will do to him if he goes overboard. As long as this one show is successful, he may as well die, for all he cares, and so can we."

"Get a hold of yourself," I tell him. "You're acting as if we're being sent to the gallows, not to a gladiatorial event. I didn't come here to waste time, wallowing in self-pity. I came here to win."

After hearing what I had to say, the bulky man completely loses the little self-control he had left, and he swings his right fist at my face, with full force.

I make no attempt to dodge his strike, as the man's fist hits me in the bridge of my nose. The impact from the blow made me feel almost no pain, and it didn't even make me move an inch from my original position. As the bulky man retracts his arm, I look at him with the same disinterested expression in my eyes as the one that the desk worker had when he looked at me.

This makes the man even angrier, and he begins to put more strength behind his punches, but that doesn't help him much. After about twenty seconds of continuously hitting me in both my head and my stomach, during which I never even bothered to block a single one of his strikes, my attacker suddenly steps back, as if he's only just now understood the futility of his actions. The astonishment was clearly visible on his face, as he just stood there and looked at me, without saying anything.

"Are you done?" I ask him.

"Maybe I was wrong about you, stillwater," the bulky man says, in a tone suggesting that he's still trying to get over the shock of what he'd just witnessed.

He then puts both his hands on my shoulders, and he looks at me with the hope of a man who had not dared to hope any longer.

After about ten seconds of staring blankly ahead of him and gasping for air, the bulky man finally recovers, and he gets back up on his feet. For another few seconds, the man simply stands there and looks at me, in pure astonishment, without saying anything. 

"Well?" I say. "Aren't you going to attack me again?"

"Maybe I was wrong about you, stillwater," the bulky man says, in a tone suggesting that he's still trying to get over the shock of what he'd just witnessed.

I step away from his fist, then I grab his arm, and I twist it behind his back. The man falls to his knees from the pain, and he tries hard not to scream, while I keep bending his arm backwards.

"Do you yield?" I ask the bulky man, as I keep pulling on his arm.

The man says nothing, as he keeps struggling to handle the pain.

"Do you yield?" I ask him again, louder, as I twist his arm more violently.

This time, the bulky man couldn't hold it in any longer, and he broke out into a scream.

"Yes, damn you!" he shouts. "I yield! I yield!"

As I release his arm, the man steps back from me, and he tries to regain his composure.

 "Maybe I underestimated you, stillwater," he says, as sweat is dripping from his forehead. "Maybe you can put up a fight even without your magic. But it's going to take more than a few martial art techniques to make it out of that arena alive."

"Don't worry," I say. "I also have a few other tricks up my sleeve!"

"We'll see," the bulky man says, and then he turns away from me and heads towards his cell.

Of the four people that were spectating our fight, two are now going back to their cells, one is heading towards me, and the last one is still standing by the door, watching me intently. The one who is heading towards me is a man about my age, who is wearing his hair in a ponytail, and who has a way of smiling that reminds me of Eiden. The one that remained by the door, watching me is a girl with long silver hair, who appears to be no older than twenty.

The man with the ponytail stops in front of me and he smiles politely.

"I see that you were able to hold your own against Bruce even without your magic," he says. "Impressive! Not many would dare to face him head on like you did just now. May I ask you your name?"

I react just in time, and I manage to get out of the way before his arm reaches me. My attacker wastes no time, and he attempts to hit me again, this time with his left fist. I stumble a bit, because I didn't properly regain my footing after dodging his last strike, but I get to avoid his next blow just the same. For the next half of a minute, the bulky man unleashes a flurry of punches upon me, in the attempt to catch me off guard at least once. However, even if at certain points it seemed as if I was about to slip up, I always somehow managed to regain my balance and to miraculously avoid getting hit, even if it might have seemed impossible for anyone watching the fight. 

After he realizes that he isn't getting anywhere, the bulky man stops attacking me, and he just stands there watching me for a few seconds. 

"Now I understand where your confidence is coming from," he says, in disgust. "I see that you can handle yourself pretty well, even without your magic. But don't make the mistake of thinking that you can just avoid fighting forever. The arena event won't be over until either you or the monsters are dead."

"Don't worry," I say. "Dodging isn't the only thing I'm good at!"

 "We'll see," the bulky man says, and then he turns away from me and heads towards his cell.

I attempt to dodge his strike, but I'm not fast enough, and his punch sends me falling down to the ground. I can feel the room spinning with me for a few seconds, and when I finally manage to get back up, I see that there is now another man in front of me and that he is pulling my attacker from behind, in order to stop him from hitting me again.

"Calm down, Bruce," the second man says. "You know that we can't afford to lose any men before the arena event."

"Let me go, damn you," Bruce says, as he manages to break himself free from the other man's hold. 

He then looks at me, with disgust.

 "If you can't even avoid a punch like that," Bruce says, "then there's no need for me to finish you off. You will likely be killed in the first few minutes of the first round. We'll see how well you can run your mouth then."

The bulky man then turns away from me, and he starts to head back towards his cell. Taking a better look at the man who saved me, I see that he looks about my age, he is wearing his hair in a ponytail, and there is something about the way he smiles that reminds me of Eiden.

"Don't mind him," the man with the ponytail says, as he points towards the bulky man. "Bruce is just a little tense because our schedules have been changed, that's all. I'm sure that he'll calm down in the morning. May I ask you your name?"

"So I've been told."

"Forgive me, I didn't mean to sound rude. It's just that most of the mages I've met in the past have had very unique names. Most parents who find out that they have a mage in the family feel the need to show it off in any way they can, so they usually give them pretentious sounding names like Zalnir or Vasiroth. It's almost like a tradition. But to give you such a common name as Barry..."

"My parents have never been the type to follow tradition."

"I see," the man says, smiling, as he extends his hand towards me. "My name is Wilhelm. Pleased to meet you!"

I shake the man's hand, and he keeps smiling at me, with a friendly expression on his face.

"Listen," Wilhelm says. "I know that you haven't really gotten the best of receptions here in our division, but I personally think that there's nothing worse than having a fight with a teammate before a life-threatening event such as this. I just wanted to let you know that I'm on your side."

"Same to you!" Wilhelm says, as he starts heading towards his cell.

After Wilhelm closes his door, the girl with the silver hair watches me for another few seconds, and then she also goes inside her room, shutting the door behind her. I decide that there's no use in lingering around any longer, so I head towards my room as well. When I get inside my cell, I see that the only piece of furniture available to me is a bed made entirely out of stone. I lock the door with the key I got from the desk worker, I throw my backpack on the ground, and then I go to sit down on the bed. 

The only source of light in the room appears to be coming from a very small window above me, which gives me a direct view towards the corridor outside the recreation area. There doesn't seem to be any movement in the tunnels outside my cell. The guards must either be sleeping, or patrolling a different corridor. I take a sweater out of my backpack and I use it as a makeshift pillow to put on my cold stone bed. As soon as I place my head on it, I fall asleep, and I wake up about seven hours later, to the sound of a guard's voice, coming from outside my cell.

 "What do you mean?" Wilhelm asks me, with a bit of apprehension in his voice.

"I mean that I'm going to give you a choice," I say. "I'm not sure why you'd want to kill me. I don't know if you've been hired, or if you have some personal reason for it. But in the end, you're just an assassin, you're not a fighter. In order to kill someone, you can't fight them head on. You need the element of surprise. Now, of course, you can still try to catch me off guard, but your problem will be that I'll know exactly what to expect. If you think that's worth the risk, then by all means, go ahead. If not, then I suggest you keep away from me until we're done with the arena."

"I understand," Wilhelm says, looking as if I'd taken all the wind out of his sails. "I won't bother you any longer."

He then turns to leave.

 I suddenly realize that the girl with the silver hair was staring at me again. In fact, I think she's been staring at me for a long time. Wilhelm notices me looking towards the girl, and he gives me a smirk.

"I wouldn't waste my time trying to talk to that one," Wilhelm says. "We've all tried, but she wouldn't say a word. I think that our little silver haired princess is either mute, or she's taken a vow of silence of some sort. Either way, I doubt that you'll get anything out of her."

He then bows politely, and he goes back towards his corner of the room. As Wilhelm walks past the girl on his way back, she pays him no mind, and she keeps looking directly at me.

Okay, now I'm certain that she's doing it on purpose. But what does she want from me? Does she want me to go talk to her? I guess there's only one way to find out.

I calmly start heading towards her, while paying close attention to her reactions. The girl seems unfazed by my decision to approach her, and she keeps looking me in the eyes even after I stop in front of her.

 Now that I take a better look at the girl, I see that she is at least one head shorter than me, and that she has a very frail constitution. I can see why Wilhelm would choose to call her a princess. She definitely doesn't look like a fighter. Her clothes, however, are nothing close to what a princess might wear. She is wearing a simple beige blouse, short leggings that seem comfortable to move in, and wooden sandals. Despite her frail looking body, the girl is wearing two knives on her belt, and her arms and legs are full of bruises, which indicates that she's likely been in a fight, shortly before she was incarcerated. 

Seeing that the girl has no intention of saying anything, I take it upon myself to initiate a conversation.

"So, are you going to tell me why you've been staring at me for the past five minutes?" I ask her, bluntly.

The girl gives me no sign of having heard me, and she keeps looking at me, without any change in her expression.

"Well?" I say. "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Still no response. Wilhelm was right. This is pointless.

I turn away to leave, but then I suddenly feel something pulling on my sleeve. When I turn back, I see that the girl is now holding me by my shirt's sleeve, and there is a blue colored writing, floating in mid-air, in front of her face. The writing is in the Common language, and it says simply: "Wait". 

 The writing then disappears, and it is replaced by a new text, this time saying: "Is it true, what they say about you?"

"What do you mean?" I ask, looking at the girl. "What do they say about me?"

Just like before, the previous phrase is now being replaced by a new text, which says: "They say that the reason why you were brought here is because you attacked a noble. Is that true?"

"We did," I say. "But we were trying to free a slave. And either way, that bastard had it coming."

The writing disappears again, but this time, there is a short pause before the next text appears.

"You don't seem to like our nobles very much, do you?" the writing says.

"Oh, I hate them with a passion," I say.

The girl smiles. It is the first time that I see an actual change in her facial expression.

"I see," the writing says. "Please, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Leila, and I have also been brought here because I tried to free a slave from a noble."

The girl then extends her hand towards me.

Leila nods, and she opens the door to her cell. As we both enter her room, I notice the fact that Wilhelm was watching us attentively, and there was a bit of disappointment on his face when he saw that I accepted the girl's request so easily.

It is only after Leila locks the door that I suddenly start to feel a sense of danger, and I jump back from her, watching her carefully.

"What are you doing?" Leila writes, looking at me, confused.

"I'm trying to tell if this is a trap or not," I tell her.

"A trap?" Leila writes, with a somewhat shocked expression on her face. "For what purpose? Aren't you aware that killing or critically injuring a member of your own division is against the rules?"

"Not really," I tell her. "Nobody bothered to tell me the rules of the arena before coming here."

"But it's one of the standard rules of all the arenas of Varathia!" Leila writes.

"I'm not from around here, remember?" I say.

Leila sighs, and she goes to sit on her bed.

"In that case," Leila writes, "you'd better take care to also not harm the organizers or any of the spectators. That is against the rules, as well."

There is no reaction from Leila, after hearing my words, but there is no text either, for several seconds.

"Very well," the writing says, after a while. "Then I will ask you the question here."

There is another short pause, before the next text appears.

"You're not really a stillwater, are you, Barry?" the writing says.

Her new writing has suddenly made me aware of my surroundings. I take a quick glance to see if anyone is actually close enough to read what Leila is writing to me, and I notice that Wilhelm has moved a little closer to us since I began talking to the girl, and he now seems to be studying me closely.

"Of course I'm a stillwater," I tell Leila. "What would make you think otherwise?"

"The fact that you're a lessathi," Leila writes.

"Fine, I get it!" I tell Leila. "We'll go inside your cell."

Leila smiles, and she opens the door to her room. As we both go inside, Wilhelm watches me attentively, with a slight smirk on his face.

"You really don't like to take no for an answer, do you?" I ask Leila, as she locks the door.

 "I'm sorry," she writes. "But you're the one who started it. Why wouldn't you come with me?"

"Because I barely know you!" I say. "How was I supposed to know that you weren't luring me into a trap or something? I'm still not completely sure that this isn't a trap, actually."

Leila looks at me, a bit shocked.

"A trap?" Leila writes. "What could I possibly gain from doing something like that? Aren't you aware that killing or critically injuring a member of your own division is against the rules?"

"Not really," I tell her. "Nobody bothered to tell me the rules of the arena before coming here."

 "Are there any other standard arena rules that I should be aware of?" I ask.

"Yes," Leila writes. "Magic and ranged weapons are not allowed in the arena, and neither are items that can cast any spells. But don't worry, your stat booster doesn't count as a spell casting item. The magic detectors in the arena will ignore it."

The girl laughs when she sees the look on my face. Even her laughter is silent.

"Yes, I know about your stat device," Leila writes, while smiling.

"How?" I ask her.

Leila pulls a small trinket out of her pocket, and she shows it to me. It's a stat device, just like my own.

"You see, my stat booster is a little special," Leila writes. "Not only does it allow me to transform my thoughts into written words at will, but it also lets me know when there are other stat devices in my area. My father is the one who made these modifications. When you first came in here, I almost bought your stillwater story, but when I saw that you had a stat booster with you, I knew at once that you were a lessathi. There would have been no point in carrying such a device with you, unless you were part of the only race that it was designed to work for."

"But the same goes for you too, doesn't it?" I ask her, starting to finally understand what is going on. "Which means that you are also a lessathi."

Leila nods.

 "Then how come you are here, in this arena?" I say. "I had the impression that lessathi have a higher status than nobility on this continent. Can't your father just pull some strings in order to have you released?"

Leila looks down at the ground for a few seconds, before her new text appears.

"My father and I are outcasts," she writes. "We aren't treated the same way as the other lessathi. We've been in hiding for years, but a few months ago my father was sold to a noble, and made into a slave. The reason why I'm here is because they caught me yesterday, shortly after I managed to rescue him."

"I see," I say.

"After they enslaved him, I never thought I'd see him again," Leila writes. "But a week ago, when the tournament began, and I started receiving my first stat points, I finally felt like I had a chance to free him. I waited until I could upgrade my speed, strength and combat technique stats to their maximum level of three, and then I singlehandedly defeated all of the guards holding my father prisoner. I only wish I'd waited until I could invest a little in toughness as well..."

Leila then shows me the bruises on her arms and legs.

 "After I freed my father," Leila continues, "I made him promise that even if I got captured, he'd go to Ollendor without me, and wait for me there. Ollendor is the only remaining city of Varathia where the lessathi hold no power. In Ollendor, we would be safe from them. But the city's guards caught me before I could get out of the city. I held them off until my father could escape, but I was already weakened from the previous battle, and I couldn't beat them all. In the end, they tied me up and sent me here. I arrived in this cell yesterday in the afternoon, not long before you made your appearance."

"Yes, and I still do," Leila writes. "That is the reason why I wanted to talk to you in private. When I first saw how quickly I was gaining my stat points one week ago, I was amazed, but that was only because I did not know about the tournament. Apparently, it had been announced many times in the past few months, but it's easy to miss these kinds of announcements when you live mostly on the outskirts of the city, in order to avoid detection. It was yesterday in the afternoon, when the gnome king announced the first round's objectives that I first found out about the tournament. This made me realize how much magical energy there really is around us. I would have expected the stat booster to gather a lot more energy, given these circumstances. What I wanted to ask you was this: How many points did you get to spend on your stats until now?" 

"Nineteen points," I answer her. 

"Nineteen?" Leila writes, looking somewhat shocked.

She pauses.

"Then I suppose that my assumption was correct," Leila writes. "It really is harder for a stat booster to collect energy inside this city."

 "I've been noticing that too," I tell her. "I've only gotten two points since I entered the city, but I used to get points a lot faster before, unless I was travelling through completely deserted areas. Maybe it's just because there aren't very many mages from the tournament who found their way to this city?"

 I skim through the pages again, trying to guess which creatures the arena's owner is more likely to throw at us. There are harpies, wargs, wyverns, three headed hounds, mammoths, giant spiders, giant eagles... The list is endless. And let's not forget that each type of creature has its own subcategories that cannot be ignored, because they are sometimes wildly different from each other. You can have red spiders, green spiders, white spotted black spiders and even ten-legged spiders, each of them with their own unique behaviors and weaknesses. 

Now that I think about it, Bruce mentioned that the arena's owner was fond of dangerous creatures, but does that mean that he might be keeping monsters of the humanoid type in here as well? Monsters might be treated as if they are all mindless creatures by most people, but the reality is a little different. Monsters of the humanoid variety are generally much more intelligent than the average creature. Some of them are even organized in tribes, and they can communicate advanced information with each other through their own languages, even if most of them don't speak Common. The ogres from the fort were one such example. If they have any monsters here that are as strong as the ogre captain or the shaman, then we might be in for one hell of a fight.

As I sit on my bed and read, I suddenly hear a man's voice coming from my cell's window.

"Greetings," the voice says.

 I turn around, to see if I can get a glimpse of the man's face, but he is hiding behind the wall outside my cell.

"Do I know you?" I ask him.

"No," the voice says. "But I heard that there was a fellow lessathi among the prisoners who were brought here yesterday evening, so I came to pay you a visit."

"A fellow lessathi, you say..." I tell him.

"Yes," the voice says. "I am here to offer you a deal. Normally we do not deal with criminals, but since you are a lessathi, I believe that it's only fair to give you a second chance."

There's no way I could agree to take this deal after I already convinced everyone to help me rid the king of the lessathi in his city. Then again, this guy is saying that all I need to do in order to get my reward is to agree to help him. Since I'm going to attack them later anyway, I guess I wouldn't have much to lose if I lied to him now.

There is a brief pause, during which none of us says anything.

"Is this your final answer?" the lessathi asks me.

"Sure," I say.

"While I did say that we could make things easier for you in the arena if you agreed to help us," the lessathi says, "what I omitted to say was that we can also make things more difficult for you if you refuse."

"In what way?" I ask.

"For example, we could have the guards confiscate your stat device, and leave you completely defenseless," the lessathi says.

"Okay, I don't know how you found out about my stat device," I say, "but I'm pretty sure that it isn't illegal to use it, according to your arena rules."

"I never said that it's illegal," the lessathi says. "I only said that we would have the guards confiscate it. A little chat with the arena's owner should be enough to bend the rules for this one special occasion. Now, do we have an agreement, or not?"

Not long after the lessathi leaves, I start to hear some voices in a distant hallway outside my cell. I recognize one of the voices as that of the guard who woke me up this morning.

"Hey, did you hear about this morning's meeting?" the guard says.

"The one between the owner and the ambassador?" the other voice says.

"Yeah," the guard says. "I heard that they're bringing out the minotaur in round two."

"The minotaur?" the other voice asks, shocked. "You mean, the undefeated champion of the arena?"

"The one and only," the guard says. "And I heard that they're also going to use the giant scorpions and the manticores for round one."

"What about round three?" the other voice says. "Will there still be duels between the gladiators?"

"Yeah, the survivors will have to fight each other in one on one duels at the end," the guard says. "But nobody is expecting any of them to make it past round one."

The last phrase was barely audible, as the guards were getting further and further away from me while they talked. The last thing I hear from them is the roaring of their laughter, as their voices fade away completely.

 Scorpions and manticores, huh? It's a good thing that I've got extensive notes written about them in my notebook. At least we won't go in completely unprepared.

I spent the rest of the afternoon reading from my notes. When I felt like taking a break, I called Daren, Kate and Hadrik through the transceivers, to find out how they were doing. Daren told me that he couldn't stand any of his teammates, and that they were all cowardly mercenaries who had come here to make easy money. Kate said that she almost killed one of her teammates during the recreation period, and that she only stopped when she found out it was against the rules. No one had tried to pick a fight with her since.

Hadrik seemed to be doing a little better. From what he told me, he'd already made most of his teammates into his drinking buddies, and they were spending a lot more time in the recreation area than the two daily hours they were required to.

I also made sure to tell my friends everything that I heard from the two guards earlier, as well as the weaknesses and behaviors of each type of scorpions and manticores that I knew of. Hopefully, this information will help them out in some way.

 After I finished talking to everyone, I got back to my reading, and I kept doing that until later in the evening, when I was interrupted by the creak of a door, and by the sound of a familiar voice.

"Farewell," I hear the disinterested voice of the desk worker coming from the recreation area, as a door slams shut.

I immediately realize what this means, and I open the door of my cell, to see who the newest member of our division is. The man who just entered the recreation area is simply radiating magical energy, and he makes no attempt at hiding it. However, he does not appear to be one of the tournament's participants, because I'm seeing a warning sign above his head, telling me not to hurt him. He must be one of the local mages. Judging by the look on his face, it's clear that he didn't come here of his own free will, so he's likely been sent here because he broke the Varathian law in some way. The mage notices me, but he doesn't bother to acknowledge my presence, and he goes directly to his room.

The rest of the day was mostly uneventful, except for a drunk call that I got from Hadrik on the transceiver, who insisted on passing me one of his teammates, because of the funny way in which he impersonated a famous noble from the Western Continent.  

The next morning, I was woken up by the same guard from the previous day, telling me that the recreation period had started.

 "Wakey-wakey!" the guard says. "It's recreation time!"

I open the door to my cell and start heading towards an empty area of the recreation room, just like yesterday. As I walk, I overhear the two thugs from my division talking loudly several feet away from me, and I turn around to see what's going on. It looks like they're talking to Leila, as she is casually leaning with her back against the wall, watching them silently.

"Hey, princess," one of the thugs says. "How about you take us both to your room, like you did with the stillwater, yesterday?"

"Yeah," the other thug says. "We have some very important tactical information that we'd like to discuss with you."

Leila continues to look at them, without saying anything. The first thug who spoke concludes that he wasn't being intimidating enough, so he now places both his hands on the wall behind her, as he leans closer to her face.

 "Listen, princess," the thug says. "You can drop the silent act. I know you can understand me. So you'd better wise up and do what I say, or else I'm going to hurt you so bad, that you'll wish you--"

The thug didn't get to finish his sentence, because Leila decided she's had enough, and she punched him so hard in the stomach that the man fell down and started rolling on the floor from the pain.

"You bitch!" the other thug says, as he pulls out his knife, but he doesn't get a chance to use it, because a sudden kick from Leila sends him flying into a nearby wall.

"By the gods, that was amazing!" we hear Bruce shout from the other end of the room.

He rushes over to Leila and he grabs her by both her shoulders. Leila looks a bit shocked, but she quickly realizes that there is no ill-intent behind the man's actions, so she doesn't attack him.

"With strength like that, you could take out a small battalion by yourself!" Bruce says, enthusiastically. "How did they even manage to capture you?"

Suddenly, Bruce realizes that he got carried away too much, and he releases Leila from his grasp.

"I'm sorry," Bruce says. "I know that you don't like to talk. But I just want you to know that I've got your back. Whenever you feel like you're in a pinch in the arena, remember that you can count on me to help. That's all I wanted to say."

Leila looks a little confused, but she nods slowly, in acknowledgement of his words. 

 "Alright, then," Bruce says. "I'll be over there, if you need me."

He then turns away from her, and he goes back to his end of the room.

The thug that got punched in the stomach managed to get back on his feet, and he's now rushing towards his fallen comrade, who still hasn't woken up from his collision with the wall. Eventually, he manages to wake him up, and then they both walk towards their corner of the room, without even daring to glance towards Leila on their way back.

Nothing else happened during the two hour long recreation period. The mage from yesterday isolated himself, just like everyone else, and he hasn't exchanged a single word with anyone. I would have expected Wilhelm to welcome him to the division, like he did with me, but it seems that he didn't consider him worth the bother. 

After we return to our cells, I go to sit on my bed, and I open my notebook. Not long after I start reading, I hear three light knocks on my door. 

"Who is it?" I ask.

There is no answer. A few seconds later, there are three more knocks on the door which are a little louder than the last ones.

 "Okay, okay, I'll be right there," I say, as I put my notebook down and get up from the bed.

When I open the door, I am surprised to see that my mysterious visitor was in fact Leila.

"Oh, it's you," I say.

Leila doesn't say anything, but I see her blue writing forming in front of her, as usual.

"Can you come with me?" Leila writes. "There's something I need to show you."

"Sure," I say. "Let me just lock the door."

After I'm done locking the door behind me, I follow Leila, and we head towards her cell. Once we're both inside her room, and she locks the door, she points towards the wall behind her bed, and her blue writing appears in front of her once again.

"Please, place your hand on that wall, and tell me if you feel anything special," Leila writes.

I place my hand on the wall, like she says, but I don't feel anything.

"Could you give me some sort of hint?" I say. "What am I looking for, exactly?"

"Don't try to look," Leila writes. "You need to feel it. Try concentrating your magical sense on your hand, as you are touching the wall, and you will understand what I mean."

As I do what Leila says, I suddenly realize that the wall is somehow resonating perfectly with my magical aura, and that it's reacting directly to my touch.

 "If you're not going to answer me, then I won't open the door," I say.

Still no answer. After a brief pause, I can hear three more knocks on the door. I ignore them, and I go back to reading my notebook. Seeing that I'm no longer reacting, my visitor has now switched to knocking once every second, without stopping. After about a minute of constant knocking, I finally reach my limit, and I go open the door, leaving my notebook on the bed.

"What is it?" I shout, but I suddenly get silenced when I see that the person standing in front of me was none other than Leila.

"Oh..." I say, as I quickly understand why I wasn't getting an answer earlier. 

Leila is staring straight at me, and she looks rather upset. Without a word, she grabs me by the arm, and she starts pulling me towards her room. 

"Wait, I need to lock the room!" I say.

She stops, but she doesn't release my arm. She waits for me until I find my key and lock the door, and then she starts pulling me by the arm again, without looking at me.

"Look, I'm sorry!" I say. "I forgot that you couldn't talk."

 Leila gives no sign of having heard me, and she keeps pulling on me until we get in front of her door. She then releases me, as she searches her pockets for her cell's key. Once she unlocks and opens the door, she gives me the same upset look as before, and she points towards her room. 

"Okay, okay, I'm going," I say, as I enter her cell.

After she locks the door, Leila grabs me by the arm again, and she places my left hand on the wall behind her bed. She then looks me straight in the eyes, as if she's expecting some kind of reaction from me.

"Is there... something special about this wall?" I ask her, confused.

"Yes," Leila writes, with her usual blue text.

"Well, can you give me some sort of hint?" I say. "What am I looking for, exactly?"

"Don't try to look," Leila writes. "You need to feel it. Try concentrating your magical sense on your hand, as you are touching the wall, and you will understand what I mean."

 "Okay, you're right," I tell her. "There's definitely more to this wall than you can tell just by looking. But it's not doing anything. Even if it's reacting directly to my touch, I feel like it's still waiting for something to happen."

Leila nods.

"That's because the wall on the opposite side of the room is made in the same way," Leila writes. "I think that these walls react directly to our lessathi auras, and that they are supposed to act as switches that need to be pressed at the same time by two different lessathi."

"Switches for what?" I ask.

"For opening a passage to the underground caverns beneath these tunnels," Leila writes. "I've seen these kinds of switches before, in other buildings made by lessathi. They always open up secret passages. And I've heard that the caverns below us are where the arena's owner is keeping all the creatures locked up. If we could get a quick look, we would at least know what we'll be going up against. Or even better, we could sabotage the whole show, by killing the creatures one by one, while they are in their cages, instead of fighting them all at once in the arena."

"That does sound tempting," I say. "But what if they catch us? Won't they be able to disqualify us for cheating?"

"There are no rules saying that we can't kill the creatures before the arena event begins," Leila writes. "However..."

 Leila pauses.

"However, what?" I ask.

"However," Leila continues, "the rules of the arena do state that the safety of the participants is not guaranteed outside of the area designated for their division."

"So, what you're saying is that if they catch us in the act, they can unleash all of their beasts upon us, without any restraint." 

Leila nods.

"We can just go take a look," Leila writes, "and if we see that there are too many guards, we'll go back to our cells."

I pause a bit to think.

"Alright," I say. "We'll take one look, and we can decide after that." 

Leila nods again. She then goes to the other end of the room, near the door, extending her hand towards the wall.

"Are you ready?" she writes.

 "As ready as I'll ever be, I guess," I say.

Leila then places her hand on the wall, and at the same time, I can feel a sort of magical current flowing through my palm. Almost immediately afterwards, the floor beneath us opens up, and the next thing we know, we're both falling into a pit, while we can see the floor to our room slowly closing itself back up, above our heads. After what seemed like a hundred foot drop, we fall into an underground lake, with a big splash. As I tread water to keep myself afloat, I take a look above me, to see if there's any way we could go back the way we came. 

The cavern's walls and ceiling around us seem to be littered with some sort of glowing blue crystals that are providing a fair bit of lighting throughout the area, but I see no obvious way to climb back up to our cell. The only things leading upwards are some ropes that are tied to a pulley which is hanging from the ceiling, but there's no way I could climb all the way up there on some rope.

Suddenly, I can hear the sound of repeated splashing water behind me, and as I turn to look, I see Leila desperately flinging her arms through the water, with her mouth wide open, looking as if she'd forgotten that she couldn't talk and was trying to scream. Realizing what's happening, I quickly swim towards her, and grab her by her shoulders, in order to stop her arms from flailing. 

 "Leila, it's okay!" I tell her, as she's looking at me, terrified. "Just grab onto me. I'll lead us to shore."

It takes her a few moments, but eventually she calms down, and she grabs onto me with both of her arms, holding me very tightly. Once I lead her safely to the shore, we take a break to catch our breaths. We are both soaked to the skin, and the air around here is definitely not as warm as it is on the surface. Ideally, I would make a fire in this situation, but is there any wood to be found in an underground cavern such as this?

My question gets immediately answered as I turn around and see a wooden cabin a few hundred feet from where we're standing. There's also a big pile of logs stacked up right in front of its door. How convenient.

 As I look towards the cabin, Leila pulls on my shirt, to get my attention. When I turn to look at her, I see that she's lying on her knees, with her wet hair covering most of her face, and her head bowed down.

"I'm sorry," she writes, simply.

"About what?" I ask.

"About dragging you into this," she writes.

"Leila," I say, "If you hadn't dragged me into this, you would have ended up drowning in that lake."

Leila keeps staring at the ground, as her writing slowly disappears.

"Listen," I say, "there's nothing to be sorry about. I didn't think this would be a trap either. I'm still not sure if it's a trap, actually. I mean, I'm sure that it was designed as a trap originally, but who knows if anyone even remembers that it exists. Either way, even if we've lost our way back, I don't think that we're in the wrong place. The only thing that's changed is that we now also have to look for a way back to our cells, while we look for the creatures."

As I talk to Leila, the ropes leading to the ceiling are starting to catch my attention. They're all coming out of the water, and the way they are distanced from each other makes me think that they are tied to some sort of platform at the bottom of the lake. Possibly an elevator. I wonder if there's a lever or something at the bottom of the lake that could activate the elevator and get us out of here.

 "I just thought of something," I say. "Do you see those ropes?"

Leila nods.

"I think that they might be tied to a platform at the lower end," I say. "I want to check out the bottom of the lake, and see if there isn't a lever of some sort that I can use to activate the elevator. Can you wait for me here?"

"Okay," Leila writes.

I jump into the lake and I swim back towards the ropes. When I reach them, I take a deep breath, and I dive into the water. It seems that I was right. There really is a platform at the very bottom of the lake, tied to the ropes. However, there is no obvious mechanism that looks like it could be used to operate the elevator, as far as I can see. The only thing that looks like something of the sort is a stone pillar, next to the platform, with a hole at the top, shaped like a spider. If this elevator is requiring some kind of a spider shaped key in order to get activated, then I'm out of luck. After a few more unsuccessful rounds of circling the platform for signs of a lever, I finally run out of breath, and I go back to the surface to get some air in my lungs. This is pointless. Unless I find that spider key, there's no way I can operate this elevator. I might as well get back to shore.

"Did you find anything?" Leila writes, as she sees me get out of the water.

 "I didn't see any levers," I say, as I squeeze the water out of my shirt. "The most I could find was a pillar with a spider shaped hole in it. Unless we find a spider shaped key of some sort, that elevator isn't going to be of much use to us. Let's head for the cabin. Maybe we'll find some flint or something to start a fire with."

Leila nods, and we both start to walk towards the cabin. There's something that's been bugging me about this wooden cabin since I first saw it. Unless there are some trees miraculously growing in these caverns somewhere, this cabin could not have been built by someone who got trapped in here before us. This means that it was most likely built by the same persons who designed the trap, or at least by people who know about it, and who can reach this place by some other means. The fact that there are a bunch of logs conveniently placed right next to the lake in which we fell makes me believe that this was done intentionally. Why would they go out of their way to make things more comfortable for us? Is this their way of granting us our last wish, before they send the beasts to kill us?

As we reach the cabin, I go inside carefully, making sure that there are no traps. The cabin doesn't have any fireplace or chimney, but there's some firewood inside, and also some flint. I take the firewood and the flint outside, and then I take some of the dried up moss from the cave's walls to provide a bit of kindling. Once we've set up the fire, Leila and I sit ourselves down next to it, trying to get as close to the heat as we can.

Once we've set up the fire, Leila and I sit ourselves down next to it, trying to get as close to the heat as we can.

 "Hey, this is not half bad," I tell Leila, as the two of us do our best to warm ourselves up by the fire. "For a quick improvised fire that we lighted with flint and moss, I'd say we did pretty well!"

Leila nods.

She then turns her back to the fire, trying to dry her hair without getting it burnt.

"You know, I've always meant to ask," I say, as I watch her dry her hair. "Is silver your natural hair color? I've never seen anyone with silver hair before, but then again, I can't say that I've met many lessathi in my life."

Leila doesn't answer me, and she just stares in front of her for a while. It's difficult to tell what expression she has on her face, because of the hair in her eyes.

"Is this something that you don't want to talk about?" I say.

"No, it's fine..." Leila writes. 

She pauses.

"Have you ever heard of the Beacon of Hope?" she writes.

"If you're talking about the orphanage that was experimenting with creating artificial mages, then yes, I've heard of it," I say. "Were you one of the lessathi who worked there?"

 Leila shakes her head.

"No," she writes. "I was one of the failed experiments. The reason why my hair is silver is because it lost its color gradually, as a side-effect of the several years in which they experimented on me, trying to make me into a mage. My hair used to be pitch black."

"Oh, gods," I say. "Is this also the reason why you lost your voice?"

"No," Leila writes. "I was born this way. And I was given hell because of it. I don't remember much from when I was little, but I do remember what the other lessathi used to say about me. They said that I wasn't a real lessathi. They said that the lessathi are a pure race that cannot have any birth defects, and they suspected that the reason why I was born a mute was because I was in fact a half-lessathi. I think that even the person that I once used to call my father had doubts about me. He never seemed to consider me his real child, and he always used to blame my mother for dying, and for leaving him to care for her daughter. That's probably why he didn't think twice when they asked if any of the lessathi who worked at the Beacon were willing to volunteer their children for experimentation."

"Wait, you just said that you used to call him your father," I say. "But you said yesterday that the reason why you were brought here was because you saved your father from slavery. This person you saved... is he someone other than your natural father?"

Leila looks at me confused.

"You know," I say. "When I refused to open the door of my cell for you."

"Oh," Leila writes. "No. I'd already forgotten about it..."

She then turns her back to the fire, trying to dry her hair without getting it burnt.

 "The person I saved is the one I've been calling father for the past ten years," Leila writes. "He is the one who rescued me from the Beacon all those years ago, when I was almost about to give up all hope."

"Is this why the two of you became outcasts?" I ask her.     

Leila nods.

"My father had been one of the caretakers at the Beacon," Leila writes. "When he couldn't bear to see us suffer any longer, he decided to help us escape, even if he knew that this meant he would be marked as an outcast for the rest of his life."

"Were there any others who escaped with you?" I ask her.

Leila shakes her head.

"My father tried to convince other children to follow him, but they were too afraid to trust him," Leila writes. "They must have thought that he was trying to trick them. He didn't have the time to talk to all of them, because one of the orphans ratted him out to the other lessathi, and he was forced to make a run for it. He made one last attempt to save the orphans, opening their cells before leaving the facility, but in the end, I was the only one who followed him."

"Didn't they try to capture you afterwards?" I say.

 "They did," Leila writes. "That's why we were forced to live the next few years of our lives hiding in the woods of Varathia. At first, we would change our location once every few days, to make sure that they don't pick up our trail. But, after a few months, my father finally managed to obtain all the parts he needed to make a suggestion device. Suggestion spells are spells that can implant certain thoughts into the minds of people, and make them think that these thoughts are in fact their own. The device that my father made could cast a spell that would make people avoid an area, because every time they went near it, they would get a sudden urge to go around it."

"Oh, I know this spell!" I say. "I have a friend who uses it all the time."

"This spell allowed us to finally settle down in one place," Leila writes. "We built our own wooden cabin in the middle of the woods, near a river, and we even cultivated a garden. Some of the animals appeared to be immune to the suggestion spell, but they didn't seem to mind our presence. They even brought us food, on occasion."

"So, how did your father get captured, then?" I ask. "Did your suggestion spell malfunction?"

 "No," Leila writes. "We moved out of the woods, eventually. We heard that the lessathi's leadership had changed while we were away, and that their new leader, Meridith, had prohibited the hunts for lessathi outcasts. My father insisted that we move into a city, because then he would have easier access to the parts he needed to work on his devices. At the time, I did not understand why he would want to risk his safety just to work on some devices. I only understood his true purpose a few years later, when he gifted me my stat booster on my 16th birthday. Back then, it could only write a few words, but he's been perfecting it over the years, and eventually, it got to a point where I could put almost all of my thoughts into words by using my device."

"Oh, no," I say. "I just remembered something!"

"What?" Leila writes.

"The device!" I say, as I quickly pull the stat booster out of my pocket. "I completely forgot about the stat device!"

I start to shake the stat booster, to make sure that it doesn't have any water in it, and then I test all of the buttons one by one, without locking in any stats, to see if everything still functions properly. When Leila understands what I'm doing, she begins to giggle silently.

"It will take more than a little water to make these devices stop working," Leila writes. "Don't worry, your stat booster is fine!"

 "I'm sorry," I say, after I've made sure that the stat device still works, "I shouldn't have interrupted. You were about to tell me how your father got captured?"

"Yes," Leila writes. "You see, the thing is that even if the hunts for outcasts were prohibited, that did not mean that the old grudges had been forgotten. The lessathi who worked with my father at the Beacon had been meaning to punish him for a long time, but they couldn't do it openly. So what they did, eventually, was that they forged some documents, stating that my father had a huge debt to the owner of our house. They got the owner on their side, and he lied that we never paid our rent since we moved into his home. We didn't have any witnesses on our side, while the lessathi had all the witnesses and the fake documents that they needed to prove my father's guilt. Given that he couldn't pay his debt, my father was sold as a slave, to one of the nobles of Thilias. I escaped before they could sell me too, and I've been living on the outskirts of the city for months, trying to find a way to free him, but it wasn't until the beginning of the tournament that I got a chance to actually do it." 

As Leila stops talking, I suddenly realize that I've been asking her all these questions, but I never even bothered to tell her that I'm currently travelling with one of her old colleagues from the Beacon. Should I tell her, though? Kate never told me anything about Leila before. She's only mentioned Diane. Was this because she thought Leila was dead, or because she considered her an enemy, for being a lessathi? I'm not sure if I'd want to get this girl's hopes up, in case Kate never wants to see her.

 "I just realized that I never told you why I knew about the Beacon of Hope," I say. "Do you remember meeting a girl named Kate while you were at the orphanage?"

Leila nods.

"I remember her," Leila writes. "She always used to hang out with the elementalist siblings that later became part of the lessathi's elite task force. I heard that she was sent off to die in a distant jungle along with all the other orphans, after the Beacon got shut down..."

"Well, your information isn't wrong, but I think that it might have led you to some wrong conclusions," I tell her. "Kate is not dead. She survived. She's the one who told me about the Beacon of Hope."

"She survived?" Leila writes, as her face suddenly lights up with joy.

"Yeah," I say. "I met Kate here, at the tournament, and I'm currently travelling with her. Would you like to see her?"

The joyful expression on Leila's face slowly gets replaced with one of sadness, as she looks away from me.

"I don't think that she'd want to see me," Leila writes. "I was being kept in a separate cell from the others at the orphanage, and we never got to talk much. Besides, I don't think that she'd want to meet a lessathi like me, after all she's been through at the hands of the lessathi from the orphanage."

 "Hey, you can't know that until you ask her!" I say. "I'm a lessathi too, and I'm still friends with her, remember?"

Leila does not answer, and she keeps looking away from me, as before.

"Alright, then," I say, as I get up from the ground. "It's settled! As soon as we get out of here, I'll call her on the transceiver, and we'll arrange a meeting between the two of you. Let's get going! Your clothes should have dried up by now, right?" 

Leila nods hesitantly, as she grabs my hand, and I help her up. We leave the fire behind, and we head towards the tunnels beyond the wooden cabin. For the next twenty minutes or so, we walk in silence through the underground caverns, using a long stick that I'd gotten from the cabin to test the ground for traps. In the areas that were completely dark, we had to rely on our stat devices to light the way before us, but luckily the glowing blue crystals that we'd seen before were also scattered throughout these tunnels, embedded into the walls, so we didn't have to worry about the lighting, most of the time.

 As we advanced through the caverns, we eventually reached a tunnel that had prison cells on either side of it, with doors made of rusted iron grating. Inside the cells, what we saw instead of prisoners were creatures of all shapes and sizes that were either growling at us menacingly, or were studying us carefully, waiting to see what we'd do. There are dire wolves, gargoyles, giant rats, harpies, griffins, and sabre-toothed tigers, all kept in different cells of the same tunnel, and something tells me that this is only a small fraction of the vast array of creatures that the arena's owner has at his disposal.

"They're not guarded," Leila writes. "I think that they weren't expecting any intruders coming from this direction. This means that there's still a chance we can leave this place undetected."

Leila takes a rock from the ground, and she starts to toss it into the air and then catch it, repeatedly, while she looks towards one of the cells. I suddenly realize that the rock she's throwing in the air is just the right size to fit through the iron grating. With her maxed strength, she could probably easily smash one of those tigers' heads with a single throw.

"Now, the question is," Leila writes, "should we kill these creatures while we have the chance, or should we just concentrate on finding a way out of this place?"

 "I say we kill them," I tell Leila. "This is what we came here for, after all. But we need to make sure that we do it quietly. The last thing we want is to alert whatever guards there are in this place."

"I'll do it quietly," Leila writes, and she throws the rock at one of the sabre-toothed tigers' heads.

The rock cracks the tiger's skull, and the creature drops to the ground, with a loud thump. Leila wastes no time, and she throws a second rock at one of the other tigers in the cell. At that moment, we begin to hear a deafening shriek from the harpies in the opposite cell. Harpies are hideous creatures that have the appearance of women with scales, wings and claws. They might look almost human, but in reality, they couldn't be more different. They are just about as intelligent as the lowliest of reptiles, and they're twice as vicious. Their shrieks are most likely meant to alert whoever is in charge of guarding these cells. 

Leila quickly changes her targets, and she begins to hit the harpies instead, but now the whole tunnel is being flooded with the roars and screams of all the creatures that are being held in the cells. This isn't good. Someone is bound to hear this noise, and if this someone has a way of opening the cells remotely, we'll be surrounded by these creatures in no time. I look around, to see which of the creatures would be the most dangerous for us to face, if they were freed.

 The dire wolves, the giant rats and the sabre-toothed tigers are all deadly, but in the end, they're not much more powerful than regular animals. Leila is already dealing with the harpies, which leaves me to choose between the gargoyles and the griffins. 

Griffins are creatures that have the bodies, tails and legs of lions, while their heads, wings, and talons are those of eagles. They can be a nuisance, but their main power lies in attacking from above, which would be difficult to do here, because of the relatively low ceiling. 

Gargoyles, on the other hand, also have other means of fighting, besides their aerial attacks. They could accurately be described as thinner ogres, with wings and horns, while their strength is comparable to that of the ogres as well. Even if their wings wouldn't be of much help here, they could still crush our bones with their bare hands if they got close enough to us.    

I decide that the gargoyles are by far the most dangerous of the bunch, so I pick a rock from the ground, and I throw it at one of their heads.

The rock smashes the gargoyle's head, which makes it fall on the ground. I proceed to kill the second gargoyle in the same way, but before I can find a third rock, all of the iron gratings suddenly open at the same time, and the beasts slowly start coming out of their cells.

Before I can find a third rock, all of the iron gratings suddenly open at the same time, and the beasts slowly start coming out of their cells.

The gargoyle that I've hit with the stone quickly dashes towards me, and it tries to grab me by the neck with its right hand. 

I anticipate its move, and I step to the side before it gets to me, sticking my enchanted dagger through its heart. The other two gargoyles try to flank me, but I push the carcass of their dead companion onto one of them, while I make a rush for the other one. I manage to pull off a successful feint, pretending that I'm about to stab this one in the heart as well, but I switch the direction of my stab at the last moment, and I slash the gargoyle's neck open with one swift movement of my dagger.

The last of the gargoyles tries to take me by surprise from behind, but I never took my eye off it during the fight, so I knew exactly when to duck, and when to strike back. I delivered the finishing blow with a stab to the eye, and then I turned around, to see what all the other beasts had been up to while I've been busy with the gargoyles.

I did not expect it to move so fast without using its wings, but luckily, my reactions were good enough to be able to get out of the way in time. If I remember correctly from what was written in my notes, gargoyles normally tend to wait until they surround their victim, before they make their attack. The one that dashed straight for me must have only done so because I made it angry by hitting it with the rock, earlier. As long as I don't let them surround me, the other two will likely hesitate to attack me, giving me the time to finish off their more hotheaded companion. 

 I step back, and I make sure that the angry gargoyle follows me. I let it attack me again, and I make use of my quick reflexes to counter attack at the very last second, stabbing it in the neck with my enchanted dagger. As I had hoped, the other two monsters are still trying to position themselves on opposite sides of me, in order to flank me. I don't give them the time to get into position, and I dash towards one of them, with my dagger at the ready. Its wings are a bigger and easier target to hit, so I step to the side, and slash at its left wing, before I move in for the kill. The gargoyle does not manage to recover from the pain in time, and I finish it off with one swift strike. The third gargoyle tries to take me by surprise by running towards me, but it was not fast enough, and I slit its throat before it could even extend its arm towards me.

 Now that the gargoyles are dead, my next priority should be the griffins. Leila already seems to have her hands full with fighting the sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves at once, so I can't have her fighting the griffins as well. That being said, I don't think that it would be a good idea for me to fight them all at once, either. I should at least find a way to distract them, first. It's a good thing that I've been reading my notebook all day, yesterday. I think that I might know just the trick to get the griffins' attention. These creatures might look ferocious, but their behavior is that of a bird of prey. And I'm willing to bet that they've been left on the verge of starvation, just so they'd be more aggressive when the arena begins. As long as I can get those giant rats to come this way, the griffins won't be able to resist the temptation, and their natural instincts will surely kick in.

I lay myself on the ground, with my back facing the rats, in order to trick them into thinking that I'm either dead, or severely hurt from the battle with the gargoyles. It's working! A few of them are coming my way. The others have now noticed me as well, and they are rushing to get ahead of the rats that are already moving towards me. I need to keep calm. I must not scare them away. Just a little closer. Just a little more. 

The griffins are not reacting. Maybe I should cut one of the rats with my dagger, so that the griffins can smell the blood?

 As the first rat reaches me, I grab my dagger firmly in my right hand, and I use it to stab the creature in the chest. The rat starts squealing in pain, while blood is coming out of its chest, and all of the rats that were heading my way before are now scattering away, in fear. 

As the rat I stabbed dies, the griffins are finally beginning to take notice of me, and they are all heading my way. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid. But I guess it's too late to complain now. I'll just need to make do with what I have.

I grab the dead rat by the tail, and I throw it far away, in an attempt to distract them. The griffins do not move their heads at all, and they completely ignore the dead rat, as they keep advancing towards me. I don't know why I thought that would work. Griffins are not scavengers. Of course they'll pick the live prey instead of the dead one, if they're given a choice. I guess I have to fight them all at once, after all. 

Or, do I? Taking a look at the gargoyle cell's door, I realize that it's not wide enough to allow passage to more than one of the griffins at once. Maybe I could get inside the cell, and post myself in front of the door, forcing the griffins to attack me one by one. Of course, this also means that I'll need to stand my ground, and not back off even for a second, because if they get through that door, they'll have me cornered.

I retreat inside the gargoyle cell, and I post myself in front of the door, with my dagger at the ready. As expected, the griffins follow me, and the first one to enter through the door blocks the way for all the others. I lunge at its chest with my dagger, but the beast blocks my strike with one of its front claws. As I struggle to get the knife out of its claw, the griffin brings its beak down upon me, aiming for my chest. 

The creature's beak sinks into my skin, but it does not get past the muscle. It still hurts, but at least I'm not in any mortal danger. I endure the pain and I manage to get the dagger out the beast's claw. While it's busy trying to maul me with its beak, I seize the opportunity and I stab it in the eye. The griffin reels back from the pain, with a loud scream, but I don't give it the chance to retreat, and I finish it off with a well-timed slash to the throat.

The creature falls on the ground, blocking the entrance to the cell with its carcass. This does not, however, stop the other griffins, which seem to now be more determined than ever to get inside the cell, probably due to the smell of blood coming from my chest wound. One of the griffins clumsily climbs onto its dead companion's body, and it tries to attack me, but its balance was off, and I was able to easily outmaneuver the beast, delivering a lethal blow to its heart. The remaining two griffins are finally starting to get some second thoughts, after seeing their second companion getting killed off so easily. One of the griffins decides that I'm not worth the risk, and it goes to try its luck with the giant rats that are running around the tunnel. 

 I do not wait for the other griffin to make its move, and I make a dash towards it, thrusting my dagger into its chest before it gets the time to react. As the beast falls on the ground, I quickly make my way towards the last of the griffins, which now has its back turned to me. I take advantage of this, and I slash both of its hind legs, in order to limit its mobility. When the creature falls on the ground, I waste no time, and I deliver the finishing blow to the back of its neck.

I retreat inside the gargoyle cell, and I post myself in front of the door, with my dagger at the ready. As expected, the griffins follow me, and the first one to enter through the door blocks the way for all the others. I lunge at its chest with my dagger, but the beast blocks my strike with one of its front claws. As I struggle to get the knife out of its claw, the griffin brings its beak down upon me, aiming for my chest.

The creature's beak passes through my flesh as through paper, and I feel an intense pain, as the bird starts feeding on me while I'm still breathing. I jump back, abandoning my dagger, but the bird quickly swings its claw at me, and this time it finishes me off for good.

I decide that it's too risky to allow myself to get cornered inside one room, so I prepare to engage all of the beasts at the same time.

My speed allows me to move quickly in and out of combat, so I make use of this to repeatedly dash back and forth between the griffins, slashing them with my dagger whenever I get the chance. The creatures are acting confused, and they keep thrusting their beaks in front of them, as if they're hoping to stab me with them by chance, when I rush towards them. One of them makes a run for me, in an attempt to overwhelm my defenses, but distancing itself from its allies was a fatal blunder. Now that I'm no longer afraid of being attacked by the others, I dash to the creature's side, as it approaches me, and I repeatedly stab it in the side of its chest. The griffin does not have the strength to retaliate any longer, and it drops to the ground, slowly bleeding to its death. 

Two of the other griffins are now making their way towards me, trying to catch me off guard. I coat my dagger in the blood of their dying companion, and I rush towards them. Before I reach them, I slash my dagger at the one on the left, sending the blood from the blade flying into the creature's eyes, and blinding it for a few seconds. I use the opening I've created to take care of the griffin on the right. By the time the other griffin regains its eyesight, my dagger finds its way to the back of its head, killing it instantly. The last of the griffins looks a little hesitant now, and it appears that it can't decide whether it wants to retreat or not. I don't give it the time to reach a decision, and I dash straight for the creature, ending its life with one swift strike of my dagger.

I decide that it's too risky to allow myself to get cornered inside one room, so I prepare to engage all of the beasts at the same time.

I have plenty of points in my strength stat, so I should probably find a way to make best use of them.

I look at the iron grating from the gargoyle cell door, and I notice that one of the iron bars seems loose. It takes me a few seconds, but I manage to successfully pull it out, and I grab it with both hands, to see how well it could perform as an improvised weapon. After I swing it for a few times, I conclude that the iron bar will be more than sufficient for my needs and purposes. With its length of over eight feet, I should easily be able to keep the griffins at a distance while I bludgeon them repeatedly and smash them into walls.

I initiate the fight by smacking one of the griffins over the head really hard, with the iron bar. The blow sent the beast crashing to the ground, and it made the three remaining griffins pick up their pace, as they keep advancing towards me with a menacing look in their eyes. I don't wait for them to get closer, and I swing the iron bar towards the griffin that's closest to me, sending it flying headfirst into a wall. I then use my improvised weapon to strike the front legs of the two remaining griffins in one sweeping motion. As they fall to the ground, I impale them one by one with my iron bar, and then I make sure that all of the griffins are dead, before I head over to Leila.

I don't wait for them to make the first move, and I rush towards the griffin that's closest to me, stabbing it in the neck while it wasn't paying attention. The three other griffins start flapping their wings and making menacing noises, as they slowly advance towards me. One of them lunges at me with its beak, but I manage to step to the side, and to stab it in the eye. I attempt to retreat, in order to better position myself, but one of the other griffins predicts my movements, and it strikes me from behind, with one of its front claws. Before I could recover from the pain, the griffin stabbed me in the chest with its beak, killing me off instantly.

 I get up slowly, staggering for a bit, in order to give the rats the false impression that I'm still hurt from the battle. The giant rats stop to look at me, uncertain of what to do. They don't seem comfortable attacking me while I'm standing up, but they don't look like they want to retreat, either. 

Their few moments of indecision cost them dearly, because now the griffins have finally taken notice of them, and are running at full speed towards their prey. The first griffin to arrive pounces onto one of the rats and finishes it off with its beak. The rest of the rats are now scattering, but they're not fast enough to escape the griffins. Eventually, each of the four griffins manages to kill at least one of the giant rats, and now they're all busy feasting on their hard earned spoils, completely ignoring the fact that I'm still here.

I couldn't have asked for a better turn of events. The griffins are spread out from each other, and they are completely focused on eating their meals. All I need to do now is kill them off quietly, one by one, and they won't even get the chance to attack me!

As I approach the griffin that's closest to me, with my knife in hand, I can't help but think that this is likely the one and only opportunity I'll ever have to ride a griffin. It's just lying there, not paying any attention to me. All I'd need to do is jump on its back, and I'd be just like one of those griffin riders from the stories I used to read when I was a kid. I mean, they've got griffins locked up in here, so they surely must have tamed them enough for people to ride on their backs, right?

 No, no, no! This is stupid! What am I even thinking? Am I trying to get myself killed?

I try to get these thoughts out of my head, as I get closer to the griffin, and prepare to strike. The griffin is lying on its belly, with its front claws holding the dead rat, while using its beak to cut through the meat. It's still ignoring me.

Maybe it wouldn't hurt if I just climbed on its back real quick. It's not like I'm ever going to get another chance like this. And if things go bad, I'll just jump right off, and kill it with my dagger. There's nothing that can go wrong if I just give it one quick try, right?

Alright, here we go!

I grab onto the griffin's fur, and I climb on top of its back, swinging my right leg over it in order to get into a riding position. As soon as I get on top of it, the griffin gets up on its feet, and it starts flapping its wings violently, trying to knock me off. I hang onto its fur and I somehow manage to not get thrown off its back, but then the griffin turns its head towards me, and it attacks me with its beak. I instinctively jump back, to avoid getting hit, but dodging the creature's attack makes me lose my balance, and I fall to the ground.

As I try to get back up, the griffin brings down its hind legs upon me, and its claws sink into my chest. The claws went through my skin, but they were not sharp enough to go past the muscle. I stab the creature in its leg with my dagger, which makes it retract its claws from the pain, and then I quickly roll over to the side to get back on my feet. I waste no time and I make a dash towards the griffin, slicing its throat wide open and ending its life for good.

Well, I guess now I can say that I rode a griffin. And I can also say with a certainty that I'll never attempt something like this again.

 A griffin that was eating nearby saw what happened to its companion and is now slowly advancing towards me. I wait for it to get closer, but I do not give it the chance to strike, and I quickly stab it in the chest with my enchanted dagger. The beast suddenly stops moving, and it slowly falls towards the ground, with a blank stare on its face. 

Once again, the information from my notebook was on point. If I hadn't read those detailed diagrams explaining the griffins' anatomy yesterday, I would have never been able to pinpoint the location of this one's heart with such precision. Now to take care of the other two.

The remaining two griffins did not seem to pay much attention to what happened to their companions, and they're too busy enjoying their meals to see me slowly approaching them. I stab the first one in the back of the neck, while it was still eating. The second one sees what happened, and it tries to get up on its feet, but I react quickly, and I stab it in the heart, killing it instantly.

 Actually, on second thought, maybe it's better to just not risk it. 

I suppress my urge to ride the griffin, and I stab it in the throat, as soon as it lowers its head to eat again. I aimed for its vocal chords, in order to make sure that it doesn't scream and alert the others, but I didn't manage to remain completely unnoticed.

 Leila was still fighting when I got done with the griffins, but she was on the verge of wrapping things up. The harpies were all dead, and there were only two dire wolves and one sabre-toothed tiger left standing. 

As I approach her, Leila makes an impressive display of acrobatic prowess, doing a cartwheel over one of the wolves, and landing with her feet on the other wolf's head, crushing it into the ground. She then takes her two daggers and she throws them into the remaining wolf's and tiger's heads, sending their lifeless bodies tumbling to the cavern's floor.

"I took care of the griffins and the gargoyles," I tell Leila, as she retrieves her two daggers from the wolf and the tiger's bodies. "There are some rats left, but they're not exactly a threat. I think we're done here."

"Not yet," Leila writes. "We're not done until we find out who opened the cell doors."

"Well, if they were hiding in this room, we would've seen them by now," I say. "And there was only one way to get here from the lake. The only place where they could be hiding is beyond this tunnel."

"You're right," Leila writes. "Let's get going."

 We make our way to the end of the tunnel, and we both ready our daggers, while we advance into the next area of the caverns. As we now enter a much narrower tunnel, we can't help but notice that there are two wooden chairs near the entrance which seem to have been knocked over in a hurry, and that there is a bowl of fresh stew lying on the ground, untouched.

"Do you suppose that the guys who were sitting on these chairs are the ones who opened the cell doors?" I ask Leila.

"It's a possibility," Leila writes. "Either way, we should be expecting an ambush as soon as we exit this tunnel. Get ready!"

 Just as Leila anticipated, the moment we got out of the tunnel, we were greeted by six sharp lances pointing in our direction. The lances were being wielded not by humans, but by hideous monsters that were the size of humans, only with gray skin, long pointy noses, large fangs, and the appearance of savages. The monsters that were facing us were trolls. 

Trolls are not as smart as goblins, but they're definitely smarter than ogres, and what is particularly dangerous about them is the fact that they have incredible regenerative powers. Unless you cut their head clean off or use fire to kill them, they can even grow back a limb if you give them enough time. These are not the kind of enemies that I was hoping to meet here.

"Throw down your weapons!" one of the trolls says in the Common language, with what is probably the most broken accent that I've ever heard in my life. 

Leila and I exchange a look, but we hold on to our weapons, while the trolls seem to be growing impatient.

 "Throw down your weapons now, or you will be executed on the spot!" the troll says.

Before we get the chance to answer the trolls, I suddenly hear Flower's voice coming from behind the monsters.

"Somehow, I had a feeling that you would be the source of all this commotion," the voice says.

"Flower?" I ask.

As soon as I stop talking, a water whip comes out of nowhere, and it beheads all of the six trolls in a single swipe. After the trolls' bodies fall to the ground, I get a good look at Flower, and I see that her eyes are bright blue.

She gives Leila a quick glance, before she turns her gaze back to me.

"I see you've made a new friend," Illuna says.

"Yes," I say. "I met her in the holding cells below the arenas. She's a fellow gladiator from my division."

"My name is Leila," Leila writes, as she extends her hand towards Illuna. "Pleased to meet you!"

"Charmed," Illuna says, in her usual disinterested tone, without showing any surprise at the girl's peculiar way of talking.

She then turns away, leaving Leila with her hand extended in the air, while she heads back towards the way she came.

"What are you waiting for?" Illuna says, when she sees that we're not moving. "Follow me."

"Wait, where are we going?" I ask her.

"There's a 'friend' of mine who I'd like you to meet," Illuna says. "I think you will find that his purpose in coming here is rather similar to yours."

"What friend?" I say. "And what do you mean by 'similar'? I don't get it. What did you come here to do?"

"Why, Barry, I thought that much would have been obvious by now," Illuna says. "We came here to sabotage the arena."
