"Barry?" Kate asks me, as she sees me head towards her. "What are you doing? Didn't you go to sleep?"

"Oh, I couldn't sleep," I say. "So I decided to go for a little night stroll, to get some fresh air."

"Why couldn't you sleep?" Kate says.

"Because I got a visitor in the middle of the night," I say. "And it was getting a little too crowded in there for my liking."

"A visitor?" Kate asks, shocked. "But how is that possible? I was keeping watch the whole time! Nobody even came close to your tent."

"Remember that spell that Eiden keeps using to mask his presence?" I tell her. "Melindra also knows that spell."

 "Melindra?" Kate says. "She's the one that visited you? And she kicked you out of your own tent?"

"Wait, wait, no, you've got it all wrong," I tell her. "She didn't kick me out of the tent. I chose to leave by myself."

"But why would you do such a thing?" Kate says. "Why not just tell her to get out and be done with her?"

#if(v_b2_ch8_energizer == 1) {
 

"Barry..." Kate says, with a dark look on her face. "What is Melindra doing inside your tent?"

Crap. I didn't think that they'd all be awake already. Everybody is looking at us, and Leila can tell from the flow of my aura if I'm lying or not. I need to choose my words carefully.

"Uh, you see..." I say, as I try to see Leila's reaction with the tail of my eye. "Melindra forgot to pack her tent, and she asked if she could sleep with me for tonight."

"And you just let her sleep with you?" Kate asks me, suspiciously. "Just like that?"

"Well, yes," I say, as I feel a drop of sweat slowly starting to form on the side of my forehead. "She's here in my tent now, isn't she?"

Leila is just looking straight at me, without reacting in any way. Does she know that I'm bluffing? If so, then is she planning to let me off the hook, or is she going to rat me out later?

 I don't get to ponder any more on my question, because only a moment later, Melindra grabs me by the arm with both her hands from behind, and she pushes herself into me, just like she did yesterday.

"Darling!" Melindra says, in a mocking tone, and with a fake sad look in her eyes. "Why aren't you telling them about what happened last night? Did our night together mean nothing to you?"

"Barry... What is she talking about?" Kate says, with the same dark look in her eyes as before.

"Sleeping," I tell her, as I begin to pinch one of Melindra's arms very hard with my fingers. "She is talking about sleeping."

"Why must you be so cold with me, my love?" Melindra tells me. "Did you already forget that you're the one who kept me up all night, until it was morning?"

"He kept you up all night--" Hadrik starts to say, but then his words suddenly turn into an uncontrollable wheezing laughter.

"All night long-- Ahahahahaha!" Arraka says, as she begins to laugh as well.

"I've heard enough," Kate says, as she storms away from us, while Hadrik and Arraka are still laughing in unison.

"Barry..." Kate says, with a dark look on her face. "What is Melindra doing inside your tent?"

"Wait," I say. "I know what this looks like, but I can explain--"

"Relax, ice, nothing happened," Melindra tells Kate, as she exits the tent, and gets up on her feet. "He was only providing me with a place to sleep. That's all there was to it."

"And why exactly would he need to do such a thing?" Kate asks.

"If you want more details, you can ask Barry," Melindra says. "In the meantime, I'll be over there, by the river bank, collecting some more rocks. You guys have fun."

"Well, Barry?" Kate says, as Melindra heads towards the river. "What exactly are these details that Melindra was talking about?"

"To make things short," I say, "Melindra forgot to pack a tent, and she didn't feel like asking Daren or Hadrik to lend her one, because she didn't really get along with them, so she decided to come to me instead."

"And you simply let her sleep in your tent?" Kate says. "Just like that?"

 "Well, she told me several times that she didn't have any other place to go," I say. "What was I to do? Kick her out like a dog?"

"Hmm..." Kate says, still not sure whether to believe me or not.

"He's telling the truth," Leila writes. "I can tell by his aura."

"Well, if Leila says that you're telling the truth, then it must be so," Kate says. "I apologize for suspecting you."

"Don't worry," I say. "I would have probably suspected myself too if I were in your shoes."

"Alright, everyone" Hadrik says, as he claps his hands in the air. "Show's over. Break it up. We need to get ready to leave soon, remember?"

"Barry, do you have anything to eat?" Flower says, as the crowd in front of my tent begins to slowly disperse. "I could make some food for you, if you want."

"I do have some food, but I'd have to be a fool to refuse your offer," I say. "What kind of dish do you have in mind?"

"Well," Flower says. "The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!"

 As soon as Flower is done conjuring the food for me, she goes over to Melindra, to see if she wants some food made as well. I take my time to savor my meal, and while I'm eating, I can't help but notice the fact that the sky is particularly dark today, without even a small glimpse of sun being visible through the clouds covering it. There's going to be a storm coming soon. I can feel it.

Once I'm finished eating, I decide to begin dismantling my tent. The first thing I do is to crawl back inside and get my backpack out, but when I reach to grab it, I notice that there is also another backpack thrown on top of it. It does not take me long to realize that this backpack is Melindra's, and that she must have sneaked it inside my tent last night, while I was still asleep.

}
#if(v_b2_ch8_energizer == 0) {
 

When I wake up the next morning from the sound of people dismantling their tents, I see that there is barely any light coming through my tent from outside. As I open the tent's zipper, I realize that this is because of the fact that the sky is currently filled with dark clouds, and there isn't even a small glimpse of the sun, even though it must have risen for at least an hour. It appears that most of the others have already woken up, and presumably, have already had their breakfast.

Not long after I walk out of my tent, Melindra comes rushing towards me, with a fake smile on her face, and she grabs me by the arm with both her hands, pressing herself against me, just like she did yesterday.

"Barry, my darling, I've had such a wonderful time last night!" Melindra says. "Tell me, did you sleep well after I left your tent? Because I slept like a baby!"

"Barry?..." Kate asks me, as she's looking at me with a serious expression in her eyes. "What is Melindra talking about?"

"Oh, I thought it would have been obvious by now," Melindra says. "Didn't you see me coming out of his tent last night? Surely it can't be that hard to put two and two together?"

"Damn it, let go of me!" I say, as I pull myself away from Melindra. "Kate, listen, Melindra only came to my tent yesterday because she forgot to pack a tent and needed a place to sleep. Nothing happened, I swear!"

 "Hmm..." Kate says, while looking at me, not sure if she should believe me or not.

"He's telling the truth," Leila writes. "I can tell by his aura."

"Well, if Leila says that you're telling the truth, then it must be so," Kate says. "I apologize for suspecting you."

"Hmph!" Melindra says, while frowning. "How boring."

She then crawls into my tent, and she walks out of it soon afterwards, holding her backpack in her left hand. Apparently, she must have sneaked it into my tent yesterday, while I was still sleeping. After exiting the tent, Melindra begins to walk away from it, but then she stops in her tracks, and she turns her head towards me. 

"Oh, I almost forgot!" she says, as she begins to slowly approach me.

Once she's close enough, she extends her right hand towards me, and she touches me with her palm on the upper side of my left arm. As soon as she pulls her hand away from me, I start to feel a strong wind blowing in my ears, although in reality, there should only be a light breeze in the air. The sound that I'm hearing in my ears because of the wind is making it very difficult for me to hear anything that's going on around me.

Melindra is now looking at me, with a smirk, as she leans closer, to make sure that I can hear what she is about to say.

 "This is for making me sleep with the bugs, last night," Melindra says loudly, in my ear. "Enjoy the rest of your morning!"

"Hey, wait!" I tell her, as she moves away from me. "Undo the spell! Damn it, come back, here!"

While Melindra heads towards the river bank, I can see the others' lips moving, but all I can hear is the sound of wind. Daren now appears to be looking at me and talking, but I can barely even make out a few words of what he's saying. Seeing that he's getting no response, Daren gets closer to me, and he begins to shout in my ear.

"What spell did she cast on you?" Daren shouts, as loud as he can.

"I don't know!" I shout back at him. "Some wind spell. I don't recognize it. There's a constant wind blowing in my ears and I can barely hear you speak!"

"No place to sleep?" Kate asks. "What do you mean? Didn't she bring a tent?"

"She forgot to pack one," I say.

"Is this what it's all about?" Kate says. "Couldn't she have just asked Daren or Hadrik for a tent?"

"She didn't want to ask them, because she doesn't get along with them very well," I say.

"Wow..." Kate says. "So, that's how you got stuck with her, then. And what is your plan? Spend the rest of your night doing night shifts so the stillwater can sleep comfortably in your tent?"

"I'm not planning to stay here all night," I say. "As soon as Hadrik and Daren's shift begins, I'll ask them to set up a tent for her, so she can leave me in peace. But I figured that I may as well come here and chat with you, given that I was already up."

 "You're right..." Kate says. "It has been a while. I think the last time we've had a private conversation was that time when we were celebrating our release from the golden fox's collars. Back when... Rose was still alive..."

Kate's words hit me like a dagger through my chest. I suddenly realize that I've been completely avoiding thinking about Rose ever since that day when we held a toast with Enrique in her memory. Even when I promised myself that I would not avoid thinking about her death, I still managed to do it. I guess some things are easier said than done, after all.

"Yes... back when Rose was alive..." I say, and then we both stay silent for a few moments.

"So... how have things been going with Leila?" I say, trying to change the subject.

"They've been going... great," Kate says, with a faint smile. "We've been talking a lot about what our lives have been like since we left the Beacon. It's been a long time. We both had many stories to tell..."

"So, you're back to being friends again, then?" I ask her.

"What do you mean?" Kate says.

"Well, at the beginning, you weren't really talking to each other," I say. "So, I thought that maybe you might have had an argument or something, before she left the Beacon, which made it difficult for you to begin a conversation."

 "Oh, no, it's not that..." Kate says. "It was just that..."

She pauses.

"You see," she says, "Leila and I were never exactly friends back when we were at the Beacon... I spent most of my time with Diane and her brother, and Leila wasn't really allowed to socialize much with the rest of us, because she was a lessathi. But even so, the first time when I found out that she died, I was devastated. Gods, why did I have to believe the lies of those lessathi, who said that she was dead? Why did I not try to look for her?"

"Hey, even if you did, it's not like you would have made any progress, right?" I say. "Leila's lived all of her life here in Varathia with her adoptive father, so you wouldn't have had any more luck in finding her than you've had in trying to reach Diane. Don't beat yourself over it too much. The important thing is that she was safe... at least until recently, that is."

"Yes, you're right," Kate says. "I really owe a lot to her father. I hope we'll meet him when we reach Ollendor, so I can express my gratitude to him."

 She pauses again.

"What about you, Barry?" Kate says. "How's it going with your notebook? Have you found anything useful?"

"It's hard to tell," I say. "I have a lot of information in my notebook, but there's also a lot of stuff missing. If only I could somehow figure out how to activate these magic stats from the stat device, it would be a lot easier to fill in the notes with the details I need, but I don't think I'll ever be able to unlock those hidden stats by myself."

"Do you think that Leila's father might be able to help?" Kate says.

"It's a possibility," I say. "But I won't get my hopes up for now. From what the goblin general told me, in order to activate these hidden stats, I'd need some secret codes that should only be accessible to the top brass of the lessathi, and I doubt that Leila's father would have any reason to know them."

As Kate and I take another short break from talking, I suddenly remember what Melindra told me in the tent, about Kate having feelings for me. Should I discuss this with her? No, no, no, it would only end up placing us in an awkward situation. But then again, if I never talk to Kate about this, things will never get cleared up.

 Maybe I could find a way to bring up the subject in a subtle manner, without shocking her too much. I should try to let the conversation flow naturally, and when I find the right opportunity, I will introduce the idea as an afterthought, just to see how she reacts. Yeah, that could work! That's what I'll do.

"So, Kate..." I say. "I was just wondering about something..."

"Yes?" Kate says.

"You wouldn't by any chance happen to have any feelings for me, would you?" I say.

Damn it, that wasn't subtle at all, was it?

"...Have you lost your mind?" Kate says, as she's looking straight at me, unsure what to make of me.

"No, wait!" I say. "I know that it looks as if I'm just asking you this completely out of the blue, but the truth is that there was something that Melindra said to me earlier that drove me to ask you this question."

"Melindra again..." Kate says. "What did she say to you?"

"Well..." I say. "She told me that you might have feelings for me... because of that look you gave her when she grabbed me by the arm, yesterday, while she was pretending that we were a couple."

"Oh..." Kate says, as she gets a thoughtful look on her face, and turns her gaze to the side. "I see..."

After a few seconds of contemplation, Kate once again looks me straight in the eye, and she continues to speak.

 "It's true that I was a bit shocked when I first saw that scene between the two of you," Kate says. "I'd seen you having a private conversation with her only a few minutes prior, and I was worried that you might have forgotten the promise that you'd made to Rose before leaving Thilias. You did promise Rose that you would come back for her, after the end of the tournament, didn't you?"

"Yes..." I say. "I did promise her that."

"Well, I hope that you won't let her down," Kate says. "I think that despite her teasing, she still took your words very seriously, and she will be waiting for your return."

"I know," I say. "I won't let her down."

"I am aware that what Melindra was doing yesterday was only a joke," Kate says, "but I still think you should be wary of her. There is no telling what goes through that woman's mind. And... you don't need to worry about me having any feelings for you. I am happy for you and Rose, and hope that you will get to fulfill your promise, after we've all managed to survive this tournament to its very end."

 "Don't you mean, after I win the tournament?" I tell her, with a smirk.

"Of course," Kate says, and then she smiles faintly. "After you win."

She then conjures an ice dagger out of thin air, and she starts flinging it upwards, and catching it with her hand, repeatedly, as she continues to speak to me.

"You know," Kate says, "you should consider yourself very lucky that I'm not actually planning to compete against you in this tournament.

"Hold on, did you just say this was your 'main' reason for looking out for me?" I say, with half a grin. "So you are implying that there might also have been other reasons?"

Kate frowns at me, when she hears my question.

"You can be impossible sometimes, do you know that?" Kate says.

 "Hey, you're the one who chose to phrase your words that way, not me!" I say.

"Well, regardless of how you may choose to interpret my words," Kate says, "I think we can both agree that what's important right now is to focus on the tournament, and on our objectives."

"For example, if the fight were to happen underground, or inside a building, you wouldn't be able to fly away to safety. And even if we were to fight on an open field, I could still get the upper hand if we were to start our fight relatively close to each other. From what I've seen in the past, you are particularly vulnerable to surprise attacks, so if I were to get close to you faster than you could react to defend yourself, then I think I'd stand a fair chance at-- Hold on a sec!

"I would not," Kate says. "Would you?"

Actually, hold on a sec! When you said that you would rain down icicles upon me earlier... you were talking hypothetically, right? You wouldn't actually try to kill me if the tournament pinned us against each other... would you?"

She then pauses for a few seconds before she speaks again.

There can be only one winner of the Magium tournament."

"Yeah... I know," I say.

As the two of us remain silent for a while, we eventually see Daren's tent getting opened from all the way across the camp, and soon afterwards, Daren also comes out, and he starts heading towards us.

"Barry?" Daren asks, when he gets closer to us. "What are you doing here? I was pretty sure that Kate was the only one who took the first shift."

"I could ask you the same question," I say. "Wasn't your shift supposed to begin in an hour or so?"

"An hour and a half," Daren says. "But I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about that fight we had today, and trying to think of ways in which we could have handled ourselves better. So, I figured that I may as well come here and relieve Kate of her shift early, so at least she could get some rest."

 "Oh, well my story is a little longer than that," I say.

I then begin to tell him about how Melindra came into my tent because she forgot to pack her own, and how I eventually let her sleep inside, while I left to join Kate on her shift.

"So that's what happened, then," Daren says. "Alright... Barry, you come with me and we'll set up Melindra's new tent. Kate, you should go to sleep. I'll take the rest of your shift."

"I will take you up on that offer," Kate says, as she gets up from the ground. "Good luck with... Melindra's tent."

She then starts heading towards her own tent, as Daren and I head towards his, in order to get a spare tent from his backpack. Once we are done with setting up the new tent, I go back to my own tent to wake up Melindra.

"Hey, Melindra, wake up!" I tell her.

"Mmmnnn..." Melindra says, with her eyes half-closed, in a sleepy voice. "Let me sleep a little longer..."

"You can sleep as much as you want in your own tent, but not here," I say.

 "But I don't... have a tent..." Melindra says, in the same sleepy voice. "I told you that I forgot to--"

"I'm talking about one of Daren's tents," I say. "I spoke to him, and he agreed to lend you one for the night."

"He did?" Melindra says, this time actually opening her eyes.

"Yes, now go sleep over there," I say. "Daren will show you where it is."

"Alright, alright..." Melindra says, as she gets up and prepares to exit the tent. "I'm going."

As soon as Melindra walks out, I enter my tent once more, I close the zipper behind me, and I fall asleep almost as soon as I put my head on the pillow.

When I wake up the next morning from the sound of people dismantling their tents, I see that there is barely any light coming through my tent from outside. As I open the tent's zipper, I realize that this is because of the fact that the sky is currently filled with dark clouds, and there isn't even a small glimpse of the sun, even though it must have risen for at least an hour. It appears that most of the others have already woken up, and presumably, have already had their breakfast.

 Not long after I walk out of my tent, Melindra comes rushing towards me, with an unusually serious expression on her face.

"Listen," Melindra says, as she stops in front of me. "I didn't mean to kick you out of your own tent last night."

"Yes, I know that," I say. "It's fine."

"No, it's not fine!" Melindra says. "All I wanted to do was to sneak silently into your tent, doze off for a few hours and then walk away unnoticed. I didn't mean to cause all this ruckus!"

"So what?" I ask her, confused. "You got your tent, didn't you?"

"Yes, but that's not the point!" Melindra says. "The point is that I didn't mean to cause you that much trouble, when you were the one helping me!"

"Huh..." I say, as I give her a long, pondering look. "So, you ARE capable of giving a damn about other people, then..."

I pause for a second before I continue.

"But why would you choose to act the way you do, if that is the case?" I say.

"What are you talking about?" Melindra says.

 "Well," I say, "from what I've seen of your behavior yesterday, you never really seem to care about what people think of you. You don't make an effort to remember anyone's names, you don't stop to think whether speaking your mind bluntly would annoy the people around you or not, and you didn't give me the impression that you'd care much if your habit of provoking reactions from people would cause the others to become upset at you."

"And why would I care if the others become upset at me?" Melindra says. "I don't need them to be my friends. I just need them to get the job done."

"But do you need them to be your enemies?" I say.

"Eiden did not become my enemy when I acted like this with him," Melindra says.

"Well, most people are not Eiden!" I say.

"But that doesn't mean that I need to change how I live my life just to accommodate others!" Melindra says.

"I'm not telling you to change your entire lifestyle," I say. "I'm just telling you to not piss off everyone that you meet on purpose. Can't you at least do that much? Or would you rather spend the rest of our days on this journey without even being able to ask someone the simple favor of lending you a tent for the night?"

Melindra is now looking at me with her eyebrows furrowed, and with another pouting expression on her face.

 "Fine," she says. "Maybe I could change my behavior a little. But ONLY a little."

"Well, it's a start," I say. "Anyway, I think we should be getting ready to leave soon. I see that the others are almost done with dismantling their tents, so I'm guessing that they've already eaten their breakfast."

"Yeah, we're already done eating," Melindra says. "You should talk to Flower about making you some food. She remembered some new recipes after watching the arena, which are supposedly rare dishes, meant for kings. Archer porcupine pie and trampler stew, I think they were called. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and grab my backpack from inside your tent."

"Wait, when did you leave your backpack in there?" I say, as Melindra crawls into my tent.

"I flew it over you with my wind magic while you were still asleep," Melindra says. "Okay, I found it."

She then exits my tent with her backpack in her hand, and she heads towards the river bank, to collect more of her rocks. Once I'm done dismantling my tent and handing it back to Hadrik, I go to Flower, in order to ask her to magically create some food for me. I spend the next twenty minutes or so savoring my meal, and then I go join the others, who seem to be preparing for our departure. Once we're all ready to go, Melindra takes the lead, and we all begin to follow her, as we walk along the river's bank, just like yesterday.

 "Ugh..." Daren says, while shaking his head, in disapproval. "Listen, I'm not going to judge, but try at least to dismantle your tent and eat your breakfast within the hour. We're not planning to stay here much longer. And Melindra, maybe next time, you could ask me or Hadrik for a spare tent, instead of barging into people's tents in the middle of the night. Just a suggestion."

"I'll keep that in mind!" Melindra says, with a smile.

"Alright, let's get going, Hadrik, Flower," Daren says, as he heads towards his own tent.

"All night long..." Hadrik says, with a tear in his eye, while still trying to contain his laughter. "Oh, boy, what a way to start the morning. Thanks for the laugh , Barry! It was greatly appreciated."

 "Any time," I say, in a dry tone, and then Hadrik, Leila and Flower move away from me, as Flower takes one last look towards me, with a worried expression on her face.

"Well, that was fun!" Melindra says. "Now, what's for breakfast? I'm starving!"

"Are you serious?" I tell her. "Are you just going to brush off what happened?"

"What do you mean?" Melindra asks, looking genuinely curious. "What happened?"

"You ratted me out in front of everyone, that's what happened!" I say. "Why did you even need to say all that stuff? What was your purpose?"

"Oh, I did it because I found their reactions to be amusing!" Melindra says. "Especially the reaction of the ice mage. Why do you ask? Did you not find their reactions to be amusing?"

As I look in Melindra's eyes, I suddenly realize that she is not in fact mocking me, and she is asking this question in a completely sincere manner.

So, what? They'll get over it soon enough. Well, most of them will. The ice mage probably won't get over it very soon, but, hey, I'm not the one who agreed to have sex with the woman she hates, after finding out that she had feelings for me."

"Kate does NOT have feelings for me!" I say.  

"Like I said, Barry," Melindra says. "Whatever helps you sleep at night. Now, seriously, do you have any good food with you, or should I take out some of mine? Because I've got some salted cheese and some beef jerky in my backpack, but I'm in the mood for a more diverse meal, you know what I mean? Oh! We could ask the little girl! The one with the banshee. Flower! Yeah, that was her name. She told me that she can conjure food out of thin air like Eiden and the fox! Hold on, I'll bring her here. She's the only one who doesn't hate me in this group, so I think it should be alright if I go by myself."

"Wait," I tell her, as I grab her by the arm. "We're not done, here."

 "Not done with what?" Melindra says, with a look of genuine curiosity again.

"What do you mean with what?" I say. "Don't you understand what the problem is, here? Don't you see that by acting the way you do, you'll only keep making people into your enemies? Sure, maybe my friends will eventually get over it, and what happened today won't matter that much for me in the long run. But what about you? Why must you insist on pushing everyone's buttons with every action that you take? Why can't you just act normally, so people will at least be somewhat friendly with you?"

"I don't need people to be friendly with me," Melindra says.

"But do you need them to be your enemies?" I say.

"Eiden did not become my enemy when I acted like this with him," Melindra says.

"Well, most people are not Eiden!" I say.

 After I'm done asking my question, Melindra pauses a little, to think about what I just said.

"No!" she says, after a few seconds. "You told me earlier that you found the reactions of your friends to be amusing. So, that means that you do understand me, at least a little! You know what I think you need? I think what you need is to loosen up. Don't worry, I can help you with that. You'll see. You will be thanking me later!"

"Damn it!" I say. "I only said it was a 'little' funny. Hey. HEY! Where are you going?"

"So?" Melindra says. "What's wrong with a little harmless teasing between friends?"

"You call that harmless teasing?" I say. "You said what you said specifically because you knew it would piss them off!"

"And?..." Melindra asks. "Isn't that what teasing is? Poking a little fun at your friends in order to push their buttons? Okay, so your friends got a little upset with you. So, what?

"No, I didn't," I say.

"Not even a little bit?" Melindra says.

"Not in the slightest," I answer her.

"Fine," Melindra says. "I'll see if I can tone down my teasing a little. But ONLY a little!"

"Okay, okay, I got it," I say.

 She then goes to the river bank, where Flower was practicing her fireballs, and she beckons her to come with her to the front of my tent. Once Flower reaches my position, she calls out to me in a worried tone.

"Barry, are you okay?" Flower says. "Don't worry, I don't think that the others are really all that upset with you. I'm sure they'll get over it by the end of the day."

"Yeah," I say, "well it would have been a whole lot better if a certain someone simply kept her mouth shut, but I guess it's too late to think about that now."

"Be serious," Melindra says. "Do you really think that your friends would have believed my word over yours if you weren't such a bad liar? You gave yourself away long before I intervened. All I did was to make things more entertaining."

"What do you mean I gave myself away?" I say. "I didn't say anything that would make me seem suspicious!"

"No, she's right," Illuna says. "The fact that you were lying was obvious even without reading your aura. You really are bad at bluffing when you are under stress."

"Hey, Melindra!" Arraka says. "I just want to check something with you. When you said that you were both up all night, did you mean to say that you used an energizer spell on the two of you?"

"And what if I did?" Melindra asks.

"Hah!" Arraka says. "I knew it! Oh, man, this day is only going to get better and better."

Flower gasps.

 "Barry, you used an energizer spell?" she says. "Have you ever used one before?"

"No, I didn't, but why would it matter?" I say.

"Because energizer spells have very serious side effects when you use them the first time!" Flower says. "Don't you know that?"

"What?..." I say. "No, I didn't know anything about any side effects. Back when I was learning about magic, I didn't think that studying about energizer spells would do me any good, so I never bothered to learn any details about them."

"Ooooh!" Melindra says. "Now I remember! I did have some nasty headaches and a strong feeling of nausea the first time I used this spell. It's been hundreds of years since then, so I've completely forgotten about it."

"You've got to be kidding me!" I say. "And what about all those other men that you used this energizer spell on? Did you seriously not notice that they had headaches all day after spending the night with you?"

"Oh," Melindra says. "Well, I never really stuck around long enough to see the side-effects kick off before. But don't worry, I'll just cast another energizer spell on you when you start to get the headaches, and you'll be fine!"

 "Cast another energizer spell!" Arraka says. "Ahahahahaha! I'm dying of laughter, here. Seriously, you're killing me. Ahahahaha!"

"Barry, you can't let her cast another energizer spell on you!" Flower says, with a panicked look in her eyes. "Especially after spending a whole night without sleep! That will only make the side-effects even worse after the second spell wears off!"

"Well," Melindra says, "do you want to spend the whole day travelling with a headache, or would you rather have the headache after we've made camp and you can rest? I'm just saying, you don't really have a lot of options, here. It's not like a little headache is going to be the end of the world, when you're safe in your camp and don't need to be constantly alert to your surroundings."

 "I guess you're right," I say. "I'd rather get sick at night than drag everybody down in a fight."

"Splendid!" Melindra says. "Now, what's for breakfast?"

"Well," Flower says. "The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if any of you had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!"

We spend the next twenty minutes or so savoring our meals, and while we're eating, I can't help but notice the fact that the sky is particularly dark today, without even a small glimpse of sun being visible through the clouds covering it. There's going to be a storm coming soon. I can feel it. 

Once we're done with the food, Melindra and I begin to dismantle my tent, while Flower goes to see what the others are doing.

Once we're all ready to go, Melindra takes the lead, and we all begin to follow her, as we walk along the river's bank, just like yesterday.

Not long after we start walking, Hadrik pulls me over to the back of the group, so he can have a short conversation with me in private.

"So, listen, Barry," he says, as we both slowly follow the group from a distance. "I know that I laughed in your face this morning and everything, but I just wanted to tell you that I wasn't trying to make fun of you. I'm actually quite impressed! I mean, you knew full well what it would mean to do what you did, considering how many people dislike Melindra in our group, but you went and did it anyway. And for a whole night, no less! It's like you didn't even care if you got caught or not! It takes guts to do this kind of thing, and I can respect that. Just wanted to clear things up."

"Uh... thanks?..." I tell him, not sure how else to respond to his little speech.

"Alright, glad we had this chat!" Hadrik says, as he pats me hard on the back. "Don't worry about the others, I'm sure they'll loosen up soon enough."

With these last words, he goes to catch up with the rest of the group, and I soon follow him as well.

 I take both the backpacks out, and then I spend the next few minutes dismantling my tent. After I give the tent back to Hadrik, I head over to the river bank, to return Melindra's backpack. When I reach her, Melindra was just about to finish her meal.

"Here," I say, as I throw Melindra her backpack. "You forgot this."

"Oh, right," Melindra says. "Thanks."

She then takes one final bite from her own porcupine pie, thus emptying up her plate.

"You know..." I tell her. "I have to admit that I was a little surprised when you just admitted to Kate earlier that nothing happened last night. I thought that you were going to cling to me like yesterday, in order to provoke another reaction from Kate."

After I finish my sentence, Melindra just stares at me, in disbelief, for a few seconds.

"What kind of a heartless monster do you take me for?" she says, eventually. "Of course I wouldn't put you in a position like that after you just helped me out!"

Her answer takes me by surprise. It takes me around two or three seconds to recollect my thoughts, before I speak again.

 "Huh..." I say, as I give her a long, pondering look. "So, you ARE capable of giving a damn about other people, then... But why would you choose to act the way you do, if that is the case?"

"Well, it's a start," I say. "Anyway, I think we should be getting ready to leave soon. I see that the others have already dismantled all of their tents, and they're grabbing their backpacks."

Melindra and I grab our backpacks as well, and we join the others, who are just about done preparing for our departure. Once we're all ready to go, Melindra takes the lead, and we all begin to follow her, as we walk along the river's bank, just like yesterday.

 "Well, that doesn't sound like any standard spell that I know!" Daren shouts at me. "Technically, I could try to dispel it, but since I'm not familiar with it, I might do more harm than good! If it were a curse or something, it would be right up my alley, but this is more likely a spell that is taking advantage of her elemental powers somehow. I think it would be better if we tried to convince Melindra to undo the spell herself!"

"Well, she said 'Enjoy the rest of your morning!' so I don't think that she's planning to dispel it anytime soon," I say.

"Maybe she'll change her mind!" Daren shouts. "Anyway, you go dismantle your tent and eat breakfast, and we'll see what we'll do after that."

As Daren goes back to dismantling his own tent, Flower comes over to me to ask me something. However, I can barely understand half of the words she is saying.

"Barry-- anything to--?" Flower says, as the sound of the wind in my ears prevents me from hearing her full sentence. "--make some-- you want."

"WHAT?" I ask her.

"I was asking if you would like me to make you something to eat!" Flower shouts, after she gets closer to me.

 "I have some food of my own in my backpack," I say, "but I would have to be a fool to refuse any of your cooking. What kind of dish do you have in mind?"

"Well," Flower shouts. "The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!"

As soon as Flower is done conjuring the food for me, she goes over to Melindra, to see if she wants some food made as well. I take my time to savor my meal, and once I'm finished eating, I decide to dismantle my tent. I then give the tent back to Hadrik, and I prepare myself for our departure.

When we all gather to leave on our journey once more, I take one long look at the sky, and see that the sky has gotten even darker since I've woken up. I have a feeling that a storm might be coming soon. As I stand there, looking up at the sky, I suddenly see a blue message floating in front of my face.

"Daren's been asking for the past ten seconds if you're ready to leave..." Leila writes.

"What?" I say, as I turn my head towards the others.

 Everyone is currently looking at me, including Daren, who has a mildly upset look on his face.

"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go," I instinctively shout at them, even though they're all rather close to me.

Daren smacks his forehead hard with his right hand, and then he begins to argue with Melindra, although I cannot hear a word of what they are saying. From what they are gesticulating, I'm pretty sure that Daren is trying to give her reasons of why it would be a bad idea for me to remain deaf for the duration of our journey. It takes him a while, but he eventually manages to convince her to undo her spell, and Melindra makes a circular motion with one of her hands, as I can feel the wind from her spell gradually stop blowing in my ears.

"I undid the spell," Melindra says. "He can hear us now."

"Finally," Daren says. "Now come on, let's get going. We've wasted enough time already. Melindra, lead the way."

Just as Daren asked, Melindra goes to the front of the group to lead us to our destination, as we all begin to walk along the river's bank once more.

 We travel in a straight line for the next hour or so, and every once in a while, we see one or two mages, who are too busy to take notice of us, while filling their backpacks with pinecones as if their life depended on it.

"What do you guys suppose they're doing?" Hadrik asks us, as we walk past two mages that were busy collecting pinecones. "Shouldn't they just be checking to see if the pinecones light up in their hands? Why would they go out of their way to actually collect them?"

 "Maybe they found a detector, and they're taking the pinecones to it."

"I doubt it," Melindra says. "If they really had access to a detector, they would have taken it with them. It can be easily carried in one hand."

"It's possible that they know a person who has a detector, but won't give it to them," I say. "We can't know for sure."

"I suppose..." Melindra says.

"Well, whatever the reason," Daren says, "there's at least one thing that we can be certain of. And it's the fact that in some way or another, these people managed to figure out the fact that they can't make the pinecones light up by themselves."

"But they still don't know that the pinecones can only be found in the sacred forests," Melindra says. "Otherwise, they wouldn't be wasting their time around these parts. As long as they don't know this crucial piece of information, they still have a long way to go until they can complete their objective."

"To be honest, what worries me the most right now has nothing to do with those mages gathering pinecones," Daren says. "Look at the sky. It's only been getting darker since we woke up this morning. I have a feeling that there will be a storm coming soon."

"Do you get storms often in Varathia?" Hadrik asks Flower.

 "No, they're pretty rare," Flower says. "But when we do get one, it tends to be rather nasty. Especially in the summer."

"In that case, we'd better watch out for falling trees," Daren says. "Also, we should expect to get soaked to the bone once it starts pouring, so we're probably going to have to take a break to dry up near a fire afterwards."

"I could make an ice dome to protect us from the storm," Kate says.

"And I could make little balls of fire to spin around us and make us dry!" Flower says. "There's no need to light an actual fire for that."

"Yes, but I think it might be better for you two to conserve your magical energy," Daren says. "There's no telling when we'll be meeting another one of Tyrath's elite monster groups, so we should always be ready for them."

 "I really doubt that we'll be meeting another one of Tyrath's elite groups anytime soon," Melindra says. "It's not like they grow on trees or anything. He can't afford to send all his finest warriors after just one group of mages. By the time we'll be seeing them again, we're probably already going to-- Whoa..."

Melindra suddenly stops in her tracks, as if she were just about to hit something, and then she begins to study an empty area in front of her very carefully, while the rest of us gather around her, trying to understand what she's doing.

"Are you seeing something there?..." Hadrik says, confused, as he tries to touch the empty area with one of his hands.

"No, don't touch it!" Melindra shouts, as she continues to inspect the area. "I still don't know what the spell actually does, yet."

 "Maybe they're planning to take them to one of the sages."

"But what would they have to gain from such a thing?" Hadrik says. "I thought the idea was to compete against the sages, not join them."

"Maybe one of the sages offered them a deal," Kate says. "Like say, for instance, that the first mage to provide the sage with the right cone will get to join his team, and proceed to the next round."

"Well, whatever the reason," Daren says, "there's at least one thing that we can be certain of. And it's the fact that in some way or another, these people managed to figure out the fact that they can't make the pinecones light up by themselves."

"You mean that they're just going to dump all these cones on the tournament organizers' doorstep and expect to pass to the next round?" Hadrik says. "They couldn't be that stupid, could they?"

"Who knows?" I say. "It's not like the rules said anything about not bringing regular cones with you. If you take this into consideration, then it might not be such a bad idea after all."

 "A spell?" Daren asks. "Here, in this area? But I can't sense anything."

"It's one of Eiden's spells," Melindra says. "It's designed to remain hidden from people without a keen enough magical sense. I can tell that it's been cast by him from the aura signature, but I can't tell what it's supposed to do. It must be some sort of spell that he designed himself, although I'm not familiar with it."

"Oh, yeah, I remember seeing this spell in plenty of other places in the past week," Arraka says. "Eiden must have been casting it all over the continent since he came back here. And he's probably still doing it, as we speak. Casting complicated spells like these takes a lot of time and concentration."

"But what does it do?" Kate asks.

"How should I know that?" Arraka says. "It's not like I'm some spell researcher. I can't tell what a spell as complex as this does just by looking at it. But there's one thing that I can tell for sure, and it's that the spell is waiting to get triggered by something. Whatever that is."

 "Could this have anything to do with that calamity that Eiden spoke of?" Hadrik asks. "Or maybe with the lessathi? Maybe they're all bombs, and they're meant to explode when they detect a lessathi nearby."

When she hears this, Leila suddenly takes a few steps back from the area that Melindra is inspecting.

"I mean," Hadrik continues, "I'd say it's pretty clear by now that Eiden and the lessathi aren't exactly best buddies. He told Barry to deliver that threatening message to them, and from what I can understand, he's killed a bunch of them in the still winter, so it's not like he'd need any special reason to kill more of them now."

"What are you babbling about?..." Melindra says, as she's still concentrating on analyzing the hidden spell. "Eiden never killed any lessathi during the still winter. He took their side..."

"He did what?..." Hadrik asks.

"Oh..." Melindra says, as she suddenly realizes what she's done. "I don't think I should have told you that."

"Wait, so Eiden fought against the stillwaters in the still winter?" Daren says.

"Oh, yeah, he killed plenty of them during that time," Arraka says. "Almost as much as me!"

"What do you mean?" Kate asks. "Weren't you the leader of the stillwaters during the still winter war?..."

 "Oh, no, no, no," Arraka says. "Therius was their leader. I was just fused with him. And the two of us weren't exactly friends. We tried to take over the body from each other constantly. But the most hilarious thing happened when he had to go to sleep for the first time. There was no way for him to stop me from taking over his body anymore, so I wreaked havoc all throughout his camp. Those idiots tried to kill me along with him, but I squashed them like bugs. I still left half of them alive, though, so that I could play some fun games with them. You should have seen Therius' face when he woke up to see the dead bodies of his friends. And the funniest part was that none of his friends would ever follow him of their own free will after that, so he had to lead them through fear and intimidation from that moment onwards. Oh, man, those were the days!"
 
"But what triggered the still winter?" Kate asks. "Why were the lessathi and the stillwaters at war with each other? And why wasn't Eiden on the side of the stillwaters?"

"Do you seriously think I was paying attention?" Arraka says. "I only just told you that I massacred half of my own army in one night. It's not like I cared to hear their reasons for going to war."

 "And I'm guessing that Melindra won't be revealing this information to us, either," Daren says.

"I've said too much, already," Melindra says. "I've promised Eiden long ago that I wouldn't give anyone any important details about the still winter, and I intend to stick to that promise."
   
"Right..." Daren says.

"Anyway, since I can't really tell what this spell is supposed to do, I recommend avoiding it for now," Melindra says. "There's no telling what could trigger it, so we shouldn't take any unnecessary risks. Come on, let's move."

For the next few hours or so, we kept following Melindra, as she led us away from the river, and through the thick of the forest, once more. As time passed, the wind that was only a small breeze this morning began to slowly intensify, while the sky was still as dark as ever. We spent most of these hours listening to some of Hadrik's and Daren's stories from their various adventures, and not much else, although one thing that I've noticed was that Melindra and Flower often seemed to be more preoccupied with their own discussions rather than paying attention to our group chats.

 For some odd reason, the more these two talked with each other, the more things they found that they had in common, which only sparked new topics of conversation between them that seemed to never end. 

Once it got past noon, we decided to take a small break to eat some lunch. This time around, we didn't ask Flower to make any food, so she could preserve her magical energy, in case of an attack. Since I wasn't particularly hungry, I sat myself down on a tree stump, and I pulled a pack of biscuits out of my backpack, to serve as a little afternoon snack.

"Barry, I thought you had some food with you," Flower says, when she sees me opening up the pack of biscuits. "If you've only got those biscuits to eat, then I could make some proper lunch for you with magic. It's not that big of a problem."

"No, I've got plenty of food with me," I say. "It's just that I'm not very hungry right now. And besides, I really do love these biscuits. I got them from a shop near my house back in the Western Continent, and no other biscuits that I've tried tasted quite like this."

"Yeah, I remember," I say.

"Well, Melindra told me earlier that she knows where we can get another one of the puzzle pieces!" Flower says. "She said that she had a puzzle piece herself a few hundred years ago, but she didn't feel like wasting time looking for the others, so she eventually threw it away. But she knows where she took it from. She found it in an abandoned building in one of the poorer districts of Ollendor."

 I take a bite from one biscuit, and with my free hand I do a military salute, as Flower turns around, and she heads towards the others. I continue to eat for a few more minutes, and once I'm done, I open up my backpack and I place the pack of biscuits back inside.

Before deciding whether I should be taking my notebook out of my backpack to read some more, I take a quick look towards the others, to see what each of them is doing. Kate is currently eating alone, while sitting on the grass, with her back against a tree. Meanwhile, Leila seems to have been coaxed by Hadrik and Daren to act as referee in a rock throwing contest between them. As with most contests that I've seen between Hadrik and Daren in the past, the rules appear to be a convoluted mess, and it's very hard to tell what the actual goal of their game is. And lastly, Flower and Melindra appear to be continuing their discussions about random topics that they started this morning.

 Since I don't really have anything to discuss with anyone in particular, I decide to take out my notebook, and to start reading from it.

After a while, I notice that the others are slowly gathering up and preparing to leave, so I put the notebook back inside my backpack, and I get ready to join them as well.

"Prepare yourselves," Daren says. "The rain could start pouring any minute now, judging by the intensity of the wind. Remember to stick together, and to watch out for falling trees."

"We're going this way," Melindra says, as she takes the lead. "Follow me."

We follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots.

 "Stay close together!" Daren shouts, in order to make sure that we can hear him through the sound of the wind. "And watch out for lightning. We should always be careful to have tall trees surrounding us, so the lightning will strike them instead of us. Make sure to avoid flying at all costs. Come on, keep moving!"

As we advance through the storm, the wind finally manages to blow a few trees out of their roots, but we all manage to avoid sustaining any injuries by being alert and by paying attention to our surroundings.

We keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?

 I wonder if Kate is still upset with me over what happened last night. Maybe I should go talk to her. Yeah, I should definitely go talk to her.

I leave my backpack next to the tree stump, and I head over to Kate, who is still eating her lunch by herself. When I reach her, Kate gives me a sideways glance, and then she continues to eat her food, without looking at me.

"Hey..." I say, as I place myself in front of her. "I was wondering if we could talk."

"Why?" Kate answers me in a cold voice, while looking only at her food. "What is there to talk about?"

"Well, you seemed really upset this morning, when you found out what happened last night between me and Melindra," I say.

"Was I?" Kate says, in the same cold voice. "I don't remember."

She then takes another bite from her salted cheese, without making eye contact with me.

"Yes, you were," I say. "And still are. Listen, I didn't mean to upset you."

 Since Kate clearly doesn't want to talk to me anymore right now, I decide to head back towards my tree stump, in order to get some reading done before we leave. Once I reach the stump, I sit myself down, I take my notebook out of my backpack, and I begin to read.

After a while, I notice that the others are slowly gathering up and preparing to leave, so I put the notebook back inside my backpack, and I get ready to join them as well.

"Prepare yourselves," Daren says. "The rain could start pouring any minute now, judging by the intensity of the wind. Remember to stick together, and to watch out for falling trees."

"We're going this way," Melindra says, as she takes the lead. "Follow me."

#if(v_ch11_romance_rose == 1 && v_ch11_saved_rose == 1) {
 "Well, maybe you should have thought of that before sharing a bed with the enemy," Kate says.

"Melindra is not our enemy!" I tell her.

"She's a stillwater," Kate says. "And a friend of Eiden. All she's done since she joined our group is to withhold important information from us, and to not offer any help whatsoever, even when we were fighting for our lives. What could have been going through your head when you chose to sleep with her?"

"Look, I know that you don't like Melindra, but--"

"I'm done talking about this," Kate says, as she suddenly gets up from the ground, and she begins to head towards an area where there are no members of our group.

"Wait, where are you going?" I ask her.

"Somewhere where I can have some peace and quiet while I finish my meal," Kate says. "Don't come after me."

After she takes a few steps, she stops for a few seconds, as she remembers that there was something that she forgot to tell me.

"Oh," Kate says, "and the next time you choose to make a promise to Rose about coming back for her, maybe you could take it a little more seriously."

She then heads further into the woods, and she leaves me behind, without saying another word to me.

 Not long after we start travelling again, I suddenly feel an intense feeling of fatigue, and a strong headache that almost makes me drop to one knee. As if the headache alone wasn't enough, a feeling of nausea is also beginning to slowly creep up on me, while I'm keeping my eyes closed, trying to ignore the pain.

"Barry?" Daren asks. "What's wrong?"

"I'm having... a bit of a headache..." I say, trying to keep my tone of voice as calm as possible.

"Ooh, the energizer spell must have run out!" Melindra says. "I guess that means mine will run out too, soon enough."

She then quickly utters an incantation and she waves her hands around, as she casts a second energizer spell on herself.

"What energizer spe--" Daren says, but he interrupts himself, when he understands what's going on. "Oh, you're talking about what happened last night, aren't you? And let me guess, Barry's never used an energizer spell before, so he's experiencing the worst kind of side-effects. Am I correct?"

"Yes," Melindra says. "But this should all get solved if I cast another energizer spell on him."

 "No!" I tell her. "I said I don't want you to cast a second energizer spell on me! Daren, you wouldn't by any chance happen to have some spell that heals headaches and nausea, would you?"

"I do," Daren says, "but I'm not going to risk casting any kind of healing spell on you right now, unless we're talking about a life-threatening emergency. Casting healing spells on someone who's recently had his heart weakened by an energizer spell is asking for all kinds of trouble. Honestly, you'd be better off just letting Melindra cast that second energizer spell on you. It would still strain your heart, but at least it would do it more gradually, and the risk of heart failure when you've only used this spell once before in your entire life is almost non-existent."

 "I guess I have no other choice..." I say. "Melindra... whenever you're ready."

Upon hearing my words, Melindra gets close to me, and she says an incantation, while pointing her hands towards me. As soon as she's done, I can feel my headache going away, along with my nausea and my feeling of fatigue. However, for some reason, I'm feeling nowhere near as energetic as I was the first time when she cast the spell on me.

"Is it just me, or does the spell have less of an effect this time around?" I ask Melindra.

"Well, that is to be expected when you cast an energizing spell twice in a row," Melindra says. "Not only does it have less of an effect, but it lasts for a shorter time as well. It should, however, hold you at least until we make camp."

"Alright," Daren says. "Well, in that case, let's press forward. With a little luck, the storm won't be as bad as Flower said it would be, and we'll get to continue our travel normally, without getting delayed."

 We follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots.

"Stay close together!" Daren shouts, in order to make sure that we can hear him through the sound of the wind. "And watch out for lightning.

"I'd rather stay with the headache, actually," I say. "I heard the headaches would get worse if I tried to postpone them with an energizer spell, so I'd prefer to wait it out."

"That's all well and good," Daren says, "but you'd better not let this affect your fighting capabilities..."

 "I won't," I tell him, as I try to fake confidence, while reigning in the pain from the fatigue induced headache.

"Watch out!" Daren shouts.

Suddenly, a tree that is ten times the size of Daren gets blown out of its roots by the wind, and it falls right next to us, as we all make a quick jump backwards.

Damn, that was close. I don't think I would have even noticed that tree without Daren's warning. I really need to pull myself together before I end up--

"Barry, behind you!" Daren shouts at me.

Unfortunately, Daren's warning came too late, and a large tree came falling down on top of me, squashing me underneath its weight, and killing me in a matter of seconds.

Upon hearing the tone of Daren's voice, I quickly realize that I have no time to turn around, and no time to think, so I let my instincts guide me instead, and I jump out of the way of the falling tree behind me, right at the moment when it was about to crush me under its weight.

As I look at the large trunk of the fallen tree in front of me, I realize, with shock, that if I reacted only a fraction of a second later, I would have been done for.

 As I look towards Kate, I can't help but remember what Melindra told me yesterday, about Kate having feelings for me. Should I go discuss this with her? No, no, no, it would only end up placing us in an awkward situation. But then again, if I never talk to Kate about this, things will never get cleared up.

Maybe I could find a way to bring up the subject in a subtle manner, without shocking her too much. I should try to let the conversation flow naturally, and when I find the right opportunity, I will introduce the idea as an afterthought, just to see how she reacts. Yeah, that could work! That's what I'll do.

I leave my backpack next to the tree stump, and I head over to Kate, who is still eating her lunch by herself. When I reach her, Kate notices me, and she stops eating, as she looks towards me to see what I want.

"Hey..." I say, as I place myself in front of her. "I was wondering if I could talk to you about something."

"Sure," Kate says, as she places her plate on the ground beside her, and then she looks me straight in the eye, to show me that I now have her undivided attention. "About what?"

 Alright, Barry, this is it. Just remember: act natural, and be subtle.

"There's this thing that's been on my mind since yesterday evening, and I just can't seem to get it out of my head..." I say. 

I then take a short pause before I continue.

"You wouldn't by any chance happen to have any feelings for me, would you?" I say.

Damn it, that wasn't subtle at all, was it?

"...Have you lost your mind?" Kate says, as she's looking straight at me, unsure what to make of me.

"No, wait!" I say. "I know that it looks as if I'm just asking you this completely out of the blue, but the truth is that there was something that Melindra said to me yesterday that drove me to ask you this question."

"Melindra again..." Kate says. "What did she say to you?"

"Well..." I say. "She told me that you might have feelings for me... because of that look you gave her when she grabbed me by the arm, yesterday, while she was pretending that we were a couple."

"Oh..." Kate says, as she gets a thoughtful look on her face, and turns her gaze to the side. "I see..."

After a few seconds of contemplation, Kate once again looks me straight in the eye, and she continues to speak.

You did promise Rose that you would come back for her, after the end of the tournament, didn't you?"

"Yes..." I say. "I did promise her that."

"Well, I hope that you won't let her down," Kate says. "I think that despite her teasing, she still took your words very seriously, and she will be waiting for your return."

"I know," I say. "I won't let her down."

"I am aware that what Melindra was doing yesterday was only a joke," Kate says, "but I still think you should be wary of her. There is no telling what goes through that woman's mind.

I am happy for you and Rose, and hope that you will get to fulfill your promise, after we've all managed to survive this tournament to its very end."

She then conjures an ice dagger out of thin air, and she starts flinging it upwards, and catching it with her hand, repeatedly, as she continues to speak to me.

We follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots.

 "Stay close together!" Daren shouts, in order to make sure that we can hear him through the sound of the wind. "And watch out for lightning. We should always be careful to have tall trees surrounding us, so the lightning will strike them instead of us. Make sure to avoid flying at all costs. Come on, keep moving!"

As we advance through the storm, the wind finally manages to blow a few trees out of their roots, but we all manage to avoid sustaining any injuries by being alert and by paying attention to our surroundings.

We keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?

 Once I reach the stump, I sit myself down, I take my notebook out of my backpack, and I begin to read.

"What are you reading?" Melindra asks me, not long after I start studying.

"Some notes that I wrote long ago about some spells..." I tell her, without raising my eyes from my notebook.

"Oh?..." Melindra says. "How interesting."

I then hear her take a bite from something crunchy, which grabs my attention and makes me turn my gaze towards her. Melindra is currently standing in front of me, eating some biscuits from a pack that looks eerily familiar.

"Melindra, where did you get that pack of biscuits from?" I ask her.

 "Oh, this?" Melindra says, with a smirk. "Why, I got it from your backpack over there. Since I saw how much you were enjoying them earlier, it made me want to give them a try as well. Your backpack was unsecure and unguarded, so I figured that you wouldn't mind if I helped myself to a few of your biscuits."

I sigh.

"Don't tell me that you're still trying to get back at me for not letting you sleep in the tent..." I say. "Can't we just put an end to this feud and move on?"

"Of course!" Melindra says. "As soon as you apologize for what you've done, I'd be more than happy to call a truce."

 As I approach the stump, I notice that Melindra is currently very busy trying to open my backpack, which I had left behind before going to talk to Kate.

"Melindra, what are you doing?..." I ask her, once I get closer.

"Well," Melindra says, "I was TRYING to steal your biscuits and eat them, in order to annoy you, but I can't for the life of me figure out a way to break the backpack's magic security. Who is it that secured this thing, anyway? The white mage?"

"Yes..." I say. "But why were you trying to steal my biscuits? Don't tell me that you're still trying to get back at me for not letting you sleep in the tent... Can't we just put an end to this feud and move on?"

"Of course!" Melindra says. "As soon as you apologize for what you've done, I'd be more than happy to call a truce."

"Good enough!" Melindra says, smiling, as she hands me back my biscuits. 

"Alright," I say, as I place the pack of biscuits in my backpack. "Well, if you don't have anything else to discuss, I'd like to get back to reading my notebook, if you don't mind."

Melindra frowns at me, and she doesn't say anything for a few seconds.

 She then leaves me alone and goes to join Flower, while I flip a page from my notebook, and begin reading again.

After a while, I notice that the others are slowly gathering up and preparing to leave, so I put the notebook back inside my backpack, and I get ready to join them as well.

 "I've had enough of this," Kate says, all of a sudden, and then a large dome of ice quickly begins to form itself around us, until it covers us completely, shielding us from the wind and rain.

"Kate, what are you doing?" Daren says.

"We're taking a break," Kate says. "As it stands, we're only getting ourselves tired for no reason. We're barely moving forward with this wind pushing us back, and at this rate, half of us will wear ourselves out before we even get into a fight."

"Even I am forced to agree with the ice mage," Melindra says. "Trying to walk through this storm is a complete waste of our time. We're better off just resting for a while, and resuming our journey afterwards."

"Well, if everyone else is also okay with this..." Daren says.

"Yeah, I think we all could use a little break, right about now," Hadrik says.

"I'll dry everyone up, then!" Flower says.

She then conjures a few dozen small flying balls of fire, and she sends several of them towards each of us. The balls of fire quickly begin to circle around us, coming very close to our clothes, in order to evaporate all of the water.

"Whoa... watch out, there..." Hadrik says, as he sees one ball of fire approaching his face.

"Don't worry," Flower says. "I've been drying up like this since forever. You're not going to get burned."

 "I most certainly hope so..." Daren says, as he looks suspiciously at one of the balls of fire circling him.

Once we're all dried up, Flower dismisses her spell, and the balls of fire each fade away, into the air.

"Alright!" Hadrik says, as he claps his hands together, loudly. "Well, it looks like we're going to be here for a while, so how about we find something to talk about, before we all get bored out of our skulls?"

"Like what?" Daren says.

"Like... for example Barry could tell us his progress on finding Eiden's loopholes," Hadrik says. "That's something that everyone is interested in, right?"

"Or maybe we could avoid giving away our strategies in front of someone who has openly admitted to being Eiden's friend," Kate says, with a cold tone in her voice.

"Come on," Hadrik says. "It's not like she's going to tell on us. Didn't you see how Eiden was ignoring her two days ago? "

"And yet she still considers him her friend," Kate says. "She said so herself. What is to stop her from telling Eiden all of our strategies the first time she meets him again?"

"Really?..." Melindra says. "Would you like me to take an enchanter's oath for that too? Because I'll do it, you know. Maybe at least then you won't feel the need to lower your voice for every little thing you say when you are within hearing range of me."

 "There's no need for you to take another enchanter's oath, Melindra."

"Oh?" Melindra says. "So what would you rather have me do, then? Plug my ears?"

"Nothing," I say. "Because I haven't really discovered anything new about Eiden's loopholes, yet."

"Damn..." Hadrik says. "So, I guess we still don't know any of Eiden's weaknesses, then."

"Well, I wouldn't say that we don't know ANY of Eiden's weaknesses," I say. "It just depends on what you'd be willing to call a weakness. For example, do you remember that time when Eiden teleported us all to your location, right after you turned back into a giant and challenged everyone to a brawl?"

 "Oh, yeah, I remember!" Hadrik says. "It was on the second day of the tournament."

"Well," I say, "the thing is that Eiden teleported every tournament participant in the vicinity, including me, Daren and Kate, but he didn't notice the three of us until later.  This means that even if he has the ability to monitor everyone on the island with his magic sense, he still can't concentrate on everyone at once. Which shows that even with all his power, he still has some weaknesses that a normal person would have. He can still be distracted."

"Well, as far as weaknesses go, this one isn't really all that useful," Hadrik says.

I shrug.

"It's a start," I say. "When you're up against an enemy of this caliber, I'd argue that every little bit of information helps."

"Fair enough," Hadrik says. "So, what if we tried to uncover stuff about his past, instead? Or his motivations. Maybe that could help us fight him somehow. Like, for example, maybe we could find out the reason why he's filling the whole continent with those weird invisible spells."

"It most certainly wouldn't hurt," Kate says.

"Are you guys serious?..." Daren says.

"Well, you heard them, enchanter," Melindra says, as she walks over to him, and she touches the edge of his blade with her finger.

She then holds her finger up in the air, with small drops of blood falling from it, while she waits for Daren to activate the oath enchantment from his sword.

"Okay, whatever," Daren says, as he holds the sword below Melindra's finger, and he lets a few drops of blood fall on it.

"Say the oath and let's get this over with, shall we?" Daren says, as his sword begins to shine brightly, with a white light.

"Okay," Melindra says. "I swear that I will never tell Eiden anything about any strategies that you discuss, or about anything you say that might be used against him in any way."

She pauses.

"Is that good enough, or should I add another vow to the list, while we're at it?" Melindra says.

 "It's good enough..." Kate says.

"Finally," Daren says, as he places his hand over his sword, confirming the oath, and then the sword loses its light.

"Okay... So, that happened... " Hadrik says. "Now, Barry, what were you going to tell us about Eiden's loopholes?"

"Oh, I wasn't going to tell you anything," I say. "Because I haven't discovered anything new since I found the loophole about Daren's protection spells."

"Spectacular," Melindra says. "Well, at least you can now all rest assured that this crucial piece of information will never reach Eiden's ears."

"Damn..." Hadrik says. "So, I guess we still don't know any of Eiden's weaknesses, then."

 "Good luck finding that out," Melindra says. "I've known him for most of my life, and even I have no idea what he's trying to pull."

"Maybe he's trying to win back the fox's heart," Arraka says, in a mocking tone. "I heard they had a bit of a falling out after that stunt he pulled in Olmnar. And I don't think they were exactly on the best of terms before that, either."

"Their relationship had been slowly degrading for a long time," Melindra says. "I think it all started when the cities in Eiden's care began to introduce the concept of slavery, and it all went downhill from there. The fox had always blamed Eiden for all the messed up things that ended up happening in his cities. She kept saying that if he would have reined them in and imposed stricter rules on them, it wouldn't have gotten to this point. But back then, Eiden had this naive belief that all humans are inherently good, and that as long as they'd be left to their own devices long enough, they would find the right path. He thought that as long as people were given everything they needed, without having to work for it, and as long as they were given no reason to fight each other, they'd all live like one happy family. Well, we can all see how that turned out."

"So, are you telling me that he just gave up?!" Daren shouts, all of a sudden. 

 "Oh, no, he didn’t 'just' give up," Melindra says. "He tried to reason with them for a long time. Much longer than your lifespan. And he did manage to lead them back on the right path a few times. But the more his expectations got betrayed, the more he stopped caring. I think it was when the people he trusted the most betrayed him that he finally lost it. I don't even remember their names. The king and queen of one of the cities. They seemed like such nice folk too... until it was uncovered that they were secretly running an underground show where people were getting eaten alive by dogs. I remember that after Eiden found out what they were doing, he organized a whole arena event just to have the king and queen eaten alive by the very dogs that they were using in their own events. It was shortly after this whole episode that Eiden told me he was finally giving up, and it was also around that time that he began closing his eyes."

"So he was just going to let those bastards do what they wanted?" Daren says, furiously. "What about all the innocent people in those cities that had nothing to do with all the atrocities?"

 "He stopped caring about them," Melindra says. "He started calling them all sheep, and he said that they deserved everything that was happening to them. He even started to encourage some of the more messed up things that were happening in those cities, saying that it was 'what the people wanted'. It was around that time that the fox started to really lose her faith in him, and also when she began to impose all those ridiculously strict rules in her own kingdom, in order to avoid what happened in Eiden's cities at any cost. Eventually, Eiden just left the continent without a word, on a journey of self-discovery, or whatever the hell it was, and when he came back for the first time, twenty years ago, he heard about the animal hunting going on in Olmnar and... well I think you all know what happened then. That's when he had his official falling out with the fox, and then he left the continent again, soon afterwards."

"Yeah," Arraka says. "He probably tried to tell her that he solved the problem by destroying Olmnar, when it was in fact his departure that caused the animal hunts to begin in the first place. What a moron!"

"Uh..." Hadrik says. "I'm not trying to interrupt or anything, but weren't Eiden and the fox just two old allies from the still winter? Why was Arraka joking about Eiden trying to win her heart back, earlier? Why does it matter if they had a falling out or not?"
