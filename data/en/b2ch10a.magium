"Hey, Kate," Hadrik says. "Come over here, for a second! We have someone that we'd like you to meet!"

Kate had only just gotten out of her tent when Hadrik called out to her. It's now been almost an hour since Daren's old enchanting master made his appearance before us. As soon as we established that he did not come here with the intention to start a fight, we told him that Daren would wake up shortly, and we invited him to join us in a game of Met-Zek. 

We spent the last hour playing cards, while Nolderan told us various stories from the years that he's spent teaching Daren martial arts and enchanting magic. The ex-sage agreed to play the game with its original rules, so he's already managed to empty a bottle of dwarven ale in the short time since he joined us. However, he appears to be holding his liquor about as well as Hadrik, since I'm not yet seeing any signs of him being drunk.

"Who is this?" Kate asks, as she approaches us cautiously.

"Remember how Daren told us that his old master gave him his scar during a sparring session?" Hadrik says. "Well, this is the old master that he was talking about. His name is Nolderan, and he apparently came here to greet Daren, since he hasn't seen him in a long time."

"Pleased to meet you, my lady," Nolderan says, as he takes a polite bow.

 "Save your pleasantries," Kate says. "Why don't you say what you really mean? It's not like I'm making any effort to suppress my magical aura at this point. If you are indeed Daren's master, then you must also be the one who taught him to fight against banshees."

"You must be thinking of Daren's other master," Nolderan says. "The white mage. We were both ex-sages, so I can see how you might make the confusion. I assure you that I have no qualms with any banshee. As long as you are trusted by these people, I see no reason why I should consider you my enemy."

"She's not a real banshee, just so you know," Hadrik tells Nolderan. "She's a woman mage."

"Oh?" Nolderan says, while raising his eyebrows. "Now, that is certainly something that you don't see every day."

"How did you know that Daren would be here?" Kate asks him.

"I didn't know that he'd be in this general area," Nolderan says. "I just happened to be close enough to sense his aura, so I decided to come and say 'Hello'."

"You just 'happened' to be close enough?" Kate says. "So you were just wandering alone, by yourself, in the middle of the night?"

"Actually, my camp is not that far from here," Nolderan says. "I volunteered to do some scouting of the surrounding areas, during my night shift, which is why I was doing a patrol around these parts. I do understand how this could look a little suspicious from your point of view, however."

 "Of course I'm suspicious of you," Kate says. "We don't even have any guarantee that you actually know Daren. What proof do you have that you are really one of his teachers, and not just some assassin, who was paid to kill him?"

"Well, if you want proof, then you can ask Daren himself," Nolderan says. "He is heading our way right now."

"Master Nolderan?" Daren says, shocked, as he approaches us. "Is that really you? You look so old!"

"The first time we meet in more than ten years, and this is what you tell me?" Nolderan says, with a grin, as he puts down his cards, and he gets up from the tree trunk, in order to greet his old pupil. "Maybe if you paid me a visit every once in a while, you wouldn't have been so surprised at the sight of my gray hair."

"I'm sorry..." Daren says. "It's just that I've been so busy with--"

"With saving the world, yes, yes, I know," Nolderan says. "You don't need to take everything so seriously all the time, boy. I was only joking. I know all about your adventures. Now stop being such a killjoy, and come give your old teacher a hug!"

Nolderan then hugs Daren for a few seconds, while patting him hard on the back.

 "I see that you're still wearing that heavy plate armor of yours," Nolderan says, as he releases Daren. "Don't you get tired of walking around like this? What's the use of all those fancy moves I taught you if you can't even do half of them due to the weight of your armor?"

"I already told you," Daren says. "The armor is the only reliable protection against physical damage that I have. I'm not throwing it away."

"Who needs to have protection when you can just dodge your enemies' attacks?" Nolderan says. "Do I really need to give you a third scar before you learn your lesson for good?"

"Ugh..." Daren says. "Let's not start this discussion again. We only just got reunited after I don't even know how many years. Should we not be celebrating, instead of having a fight?"

"You're absolutely right, Daren!" Nolderan says. "Hold on, let me get another bottle of dwarven ale, so we can have a toast."

"Dwarven ale?..." Daren says. "At this hour? You can't be serious! What if we get attacked?"

 "Of course you would say that..." Nolderan says. "Well, in that case, I'll just clink these two bottles, and imagine that you're also drinking with me. Cheers, Daren!"

He then clinks two dwarven ale bottles, like he said he would, and he takes a long sip from one of them.

"You're all welcome to join me in this toast, of course, if you want," Nolderan says, as he looks towards Hadrik, Kate and me. "It's a celebration, after all!"

 "Sure, I'll join," I say. "Give me the bottle."

"Good, good," Nolderan says, as he hands me the bottle that he didn't drink from. "Anyone else?"

"Well, I'm already holding a dwarven ale bottle, so why not?" Hadrik says, as he joins us, and prepares for the toast.

"I'll pass," Kate says, simply.

"Let us toast, then!" Nolderan says, as he raises his bottle, while Hadrik and I do the same. "Cheers, my friends! Thank you all for keeping my old pupil safe, during this tournament. I know that he can be a little hard-headed at times, but he has a good heart."

"Cheers!" Hadrik and I say, as we all clink our bottles together and start to drink.

As I put down the bottle, I suddenly realize that I may have went a little overboard with the drinking, considering that I also had to take a lot of sips of dwarven ale while I was playing cards with Hadrik. I can already feel my head spinning a little from all the alcohol. Hopefully, this drunken sensation will pass soon.

"What's going on?" Flower asks, as her and Leila are both coming towards us, after having been woken up from the noise. "Are we having a visitor?"

"Well, I do still have this dwarven ale bottle in my hand, so yeah, sure, I'll join," Hadrik says, as he prepares to join the toast.

"Good!" Nolderan says, and he puts the second bottle that he was holding in his hands on the ground. "Let us toast, then! Cheers, my friends! Thank you all for keeping my old pupil safe, during this tournament. I know that he can be a little hard-headed at times, but he has a good heart."

 "Yeah, this is Daren's old enchanting master," Hadrik says. "It's the first time that they're seeing each other in over ten years, so we're holding a toast to celebrate their reunion."

"Another female mage?..." Nolderan asks, as he senses the magic in Flower's aura.

"Uh... sort of," Hadrik says. "The girl is a mage, but there's also a banshee that lives in the same body. Their names are Flower and Illuna. You can tell when the banshee is talking because the girl's eyes will turn blue. It's a little confusing at first, but you'll get used to it soon enough."

"Right, right..." Nolderan says.

"Pleased to meet you!" Flower says, smiling.

"And this over here is Leila," Hadrik says. "She's a lessathi."

"A what?..." Nolderan asks.

"Uh..." Hadrik says. "I think the locals call them 'the ancients'. Does that name sound familiar?"

"Oh, yes, yes..." Nolderan says. "The name does ring a bell. I think they were some old forgotten race that used to be very good at making magical devices."

"Yes, exactly," Hadrik says. "Leila is a descendant of that race."

 "Charmed," Leila writes.

"Err..." Nolderan says, not exactly sure how to interpret the floating text in front of him.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you," Hadrik says. "Leila can't talk. She can only communicate through writing."

"Ah, so that's what the blue text was about," Nolderan says, as he then turns his gaze towards Leila. "I'm pleased to meet you as well."

"Master... it's not that I'm not glad to see you, but may I ask what you are doing here, in Varathia?" Daren says. "I thought that you were done competing in mage tournaments after... well, you know..."

"After I lost my sage title, you mean?" Nolderan says. "You can say it out loud, boy. It's not like I'm going to sulk. It's been fourteen years since then. I've moved on by now. Sure, I haven't really been competing as much, since then, but this time it's different. This Magium tournament has given me an opportunity of a lifetime, so I couldn't just ignore it."

 "I'm sorry for interrupting," Flower says, "but why didn't you try to reclaim your sage title after you lost it if it meant so much to you? Don't they hold a competition for it every year, in each of your continents?"

"Are you by any chance from Varathia, little girl?" Nolderan asks.

"Yes, I was born here," Flower says. "Why do you ask?"

"Well, I suppose that would explain why you would ask such a question, then," Nolderan says. "I'm guessing that you don't really get a lot of information about the outside world on this isolated continent, do you?"

"We do get some news, but it's not much..." Flower says. "Have the yearly sage competitions been cancelled in the last decade? Is that why you stopped competing in these tournaments?"

"Oh, no, they're still holding the competitions," Nolderan says. "It's because of the person who took the title away from me that I've given up on the hope of winning the sage title ever again..."

"What do you mean?" Flower says.

 "The current four sages are unlike any of the sages that have held the title in the last century," Daren says. "They are in a league of their own. Usually, a sage would not hold a title for more than two or three years before being dethroned, but three of the four current sages have remained undefeated for more than a decade. Azarius, the Sage of the West has been a sage for more than thirty years. He is practically the face of the Western Continent at this point. You see his portrait drawn on newspapers almost every week. One would have expected him to grow weaker, with old age, but every year, he seems to get stronger, instead. I think that everyone is mostly seeing the yearly contests as a formality at this point, and they're all assuming that Azarius will keep holding the title until he dies of old age."

"I know that you really like Azarius, Daren, but you shouldn't talk only about him," Hadrik says. "The other three sages may not have held their titles as long as him, but I'd say that their feats are equally impressive. Talmak, the Sage of the North, is regarded as the strongest earth elementalist of our time. All of the adversaries that he's had in the twelve years since he's inherited his title have been nowhere near his level of power. The only one who actually gave him a run for his money was the previous sage, but he's dead now, along with almost every other mage who dared to challenge Talmak to a fight, over the years. Then there's Selgurd. The elf. Oh man, don't even get me started on the elf..."

"Did he also keep his sage title for a long time?" Flower asks.

 "No, but the sage before him did," Hadrik says. "He was considered to be on par with the other three long reigning sages, and everyone thought that nobody would ever defeat him. And then comes this no-name elf out of nowhere, and he kills him just like that, in less than a minute. Nobody even knows how he did it. He just made an illusion, so nobody could see or hear what was happening in the arena, and when the illusion was over, the Sage of the East was just lying on the floor, lifeless, and the crowds went completely silent. This happened last year. An investigation has been started to figure out what exactly lead to the old sage's death, but no evidence has been found as of yet. The elf would not say what spell he used, but the common consensus is that he most likely used a mind affecting spell of some kind."

 "There were no external wounds," Daren says, "so if it really was a mind affecting spell, then it must have been one similar to the spell that the ogre shaman cast on us, in the fort, where you could get killed inside your own mind, if you weren't careful. The spell researchers who analyzed the traces of the spell could not find a match for any known spell, however. Or so they claimed."

"I don't know if the organizers are trying to hide something or not," Hadrik says, "but the fact of the matter is that the elf has somehow managed to seize the title of Sage of the East, and a lot of people are unhappy with this turn of events. I'm not really sure how he did it, but Selgurd did kill one of the strongest mages of our time, with minimal effort, so he will most certainly be a force to be reckoned with."

"What about the Sage of the South?" Flower asks.

 "The Sage of the South is the one I fought, fourteen years ago," Nolderan says. "I stood no chance against him in the competition. Even to this day, he remains undefeated, and it never really looked like anyone has posed any serious threat to him since he took the title away from me. The man is a renowned dragon hunter that goes by the name of Drakesbane. I'm not sure what his real name is, but that's what everyone calls him now, due to the large number of dragon heads that he has in his collection. Dragons are something of a legend these days, because they mostly stay hidden, and no longer attack villages, like they used to in the past, but Drakesbane goes to hunt them in their own territory as a sport. A lot of people like to pretend that the dragon heads he brings home belonged to wyverns instead, in order to keep believing that dragons do not exist, but I don't think that anyone who's actually seen one of those heads up close could fool themselves into believing such nonsense. There is a very clear difference between a wyvern's head and a dragon's head, and that difference would be obvious to anyone who is not being willfully ignorant."

 All of a sudden, we hear a few loud beeps coming from Leila's pocket, and also from mine. We both take out our stat devices at the same time, and I see that I now have three extra points to invest in my stats.

 "Did you also get three points?" I ask Leila.

"Yes, I put them all in my reflexes," Leila writes, as we both put our stat devices back in our pockets. 

"Were those... fortune teller trinkets?" Nolderan asks, confused.

"Indeed, they were," I say.

"They're not using them for fortune telling," Daren says. "They're using them to magically enhance their physical abilities. I know that it's a little hard to believe, but I've seen it with my own eyes, so I can confirm that it's true."

"Interesting..." Nolderan says. "I always thought that those devices were nothing more than toys, but I guess that I was mistaken. How well do they work, exactly?"

"It depends on your actual physical condition," Leila writes. "If you're weaker, then you're going to get less effect out of the stat devices."

"I see..." Nolderan says.

"So... what have you been up to, these past few years?" Daren asks his old master. "I've heard rumors that you've started doing mercenary work, but I'm not sure if they were true or not."

 "Oh, they were true, alright," Nolderan says. "Losing my sage title so soon after I'd earned it and in such a spectacular fashion wasn't really very good for my business. People started to think that I was just some washed up old man, and they gradually began to look for other enchanting and martial arts masters. There's no shortage of those in the Southern Continent, after all. So, when people stopped coming to me to teach them, I decided that my talents would be better used elsewhere. You see... when you're doing mercenary work, nobody is going to care about your reputation. They just need you to get the job done. It might not be the most ideal career, but it puts food on the table."

"I'm so sorry..." Daren says. "I did not know that it's been so rough for you in these past years. I should have at least left you a transceiver to keep in touch."

"Don't be sorry," Nolderan says. "We all have our ups and downs. It's the way of life. But like I said, at least this tournament has provided me with the opportunity to change my life for the better. That's why we're all here, isn't it? To try and change our lives for the better?"

"Actually..." Daren says. "The reason why I came here is that--"

"Hey, not that I want to interrupt you or anything," Arraka says, "but Illuna told me to let you all know when there are enemies trying to surround us, and it just so happens that this is exactly what's happening right now, as I speak."

"Is it monsters again?" Daren asks.

 "Yeah, monsters," Arraka says. "More than there were last time. They're all suppressing their auras again, but I can recognize the orc and the two ogres that got away from us two days ago. They must have gone to get reinforcements. I don't sense the two goblins that bailed them out last time anymore, so they must be a lot more confident in their chances of winning this time around. I'm counting at least fifteen warriors and five mages. Actually no, make that seventeen warriors. Five of them are ogres, including the two from before. Twelve of them are orcs, including their captain with the flaming battleaxes. The five mages are a mixture of orcs and ogres, but there are no more goblins this time."

"Well, master," Daren tells Nolderan. "I think this is the time for you to go. These monsters have come here to kill our group, specifically, so as long as you avoid them on your way back to your camp, they will most likely ignore you and focus on us. It's sad that this reunion had to be so short, but as long as we're both participating in this tournament, I'm sure that our paths will cross again.  Assuming that we'll survive this battle, that is..."

 "What are you talking about, boy?" Nolderan says. "Do you think I'm just going to run away and let my favorite disciple get killed off by some monsters, mere minutes after we've been reunited once more?"

"These aren't just any monsters," Daren says. "They are elite troops of the dragon who rules most of the monster races on this continent. It's not going to be an easy fight."

"Bah!" Nolderan says. "You've said this before. Remember that time when we went to raid that cave full of ogres and trolls and we butchered them all within minutes? You were saying that it would be a hard fight back then too."

"That happened when I was barely twenty years old!" Daren says. "Gods, now I remember... I had only been training for several months, and that was already our third monster hunt. How the hell did you manage to convince me to remain your pupil for so long?"

"Stop complaining," Nolderan says. "My training worked, didn't it? You can't just do mock battles all the time and expect to magically become a seasoned warrior. Real battles are where you truly get to test your skills."

"Are the monsters getting closer?" Hadrik asks. "I can't really tell with my magic sense."

 "They are most definitely getting closer," Kate says. "In fact, we should be seeing them any minute. It looks like they've given up on trying to flank us from all sides, because of the large area without trees in front of us that can't provide them cover, so they're now all trying to assemble in the woods behind us, and to the sides."

"At least that should keep them away from the tents when we fight," Hadrik says. "The last thing we want is to get our tents damaged when we're nowhere near a city to buy any replacements."

"Don't forget the discussion that we had after our last battle!" Daren says. "We're facing against a lot more enemies today, so we can't afford to make any mistakes. Leila, no more rushing into the enemy lines, alright? Kate, do you remember what you need to focus on?"

"Yes," Kate says. "I remember."

She then shoots several icicles into the woods on our left side, and two of the ogres suddenly drop dead, from behind the trees. The three ogre warriors that were left alive are now all shouting loudly, and they're advancing towards us at a rapid pace. 

Seeing that their formation has been broken, the orcs that were hiding behind the trees on our right side are now also revealing themselves and moving slowly towards us, while forming a line, with their shields raised in front of them and their maces in their right hands.

 Kate tries to attack the three ogres with another barrage of icicles, but this time, they use their huge clubs to defend themselves from her projectiles.

"Flower," Daren says. "Fly up into the air, and bombard the ogres with fireballs. They need to die before they reach us."

"I'm on it!" Flower says, as she jumps into the air and then propels herself upwards using her fire jets.

"The rest of us need to deal with the orcs," Daren says. "They all have anti-magic armor, so don't bother to attack them if you're an elementalist."

While Daren was talking, Flower started to shoot fireballs at the three ogres that were still heading towards us. The monsters tried to jump away from the explosions, but this left them defenseless against Kate's icicles, which penetrated their skulls and killed them all on the spot.

"Good," Daren says. "The ogres are already dead. Let's finish the orcs off quick, and then we'll head for the mages."

TEXT:

 While we were talking, the orcs have split into two groups, each of them forming a wall with their shields, and slowly advancing towards us from both sides. The orc captain from our last battle is, however, nowhere to be seen.

"I'll take the ones on the left," Nolderan says, as he heads towards the monsters.

"There are five orcs on the left," Daren says, while he starts following his old master into battle. "I'm coming with you. Hadrik should be able to handle half of the warriors by himself without much trouble."

He then sees that Leila has remained behind, uncertain of what to do.

"Leila, you should go help Hadrik," Daren says. "Master Nolderan and I should be able to handle ourselves against five orcs."

Leila nods, and she goes towards the orcs on the right, along with Hadrik.

"I'll go find the mages," Kate says.

"No, wait," Daren says. "We shouldn't risk splitting up. There might be traps waiting for us in the woods. We'll all go together, after we're done with the warriors."

"Understood..." Kate says.

 Daren then heads into battle, along with his master, as Hadrik and Leila are getting ready to fight the monsters on the right side. The first one to engage the enemy is Hadrik. He punches right through the orcs' shield wall on the right, putting a large dent into one of the monsters' shields, while knocking its holder on his back. Then, he jumps high into the air, and he lands with his fist on a second orc, just as the monster raises his shield to protect himself. 

The sound made by Hadrik's fist hitting the metal shield resounded throughout the whole clearing, and immediately afterwards, we could hear the orc's scream, as his arm broke from all the pressure. While the warrior is still struggling to recover, Hadrik quickly grabs him by his feet, and he throws him into two of his comrades, which sends them all crashing to the ground.

Meanwhile, Daren and Nolderan have both reached the orcs on the left, and now they're flanking them from two sides, forcing the monsters to give up on their shield wall and to focus on the adversaries in front of them. As Nolderan begins to fight, I can definitely see the resemblance between his fighting style, and the one that Daren is using. However, Nolderan's style seems to focus a lot more on not getting hit at all, while Daren often likes to parry blows, and to block them with his shield, while he fights.

 One other thing I'm noticing is the incredible synchronization between the two of them. Even if they've been apart for more than ten years, you can clearly see that they know each other's moves by heart, and that they don't need to communicate their actions through words, in the heat of battle, because one will always know what the other is planning to do next. More than this, it seems that neither of them is hesitant in leaving their guard down, while the other is watching their back. It's clear that such a level of teamwork can only be achieved by warriors who have spent many years fighting together, side by side.

"Just like old times, eh, Daren?" Nolderan says, after he slices the head of an orc clean off his shoulders.

"Yes, I see that you're still as reckless as ever!" Daren says, as he blocks one of the monsters' maces with his shield. "I can't believe that you're still alive after all this time!"

"You may be saying this, but you are clearly enjoying the fight," Nolderan says, with a grin, as he dances away from one enemy, and prepares to engage another. "Here's another reckless move for you, boy. Get ready!"

He then runs full speed ahead, towards an orc that is too busy fighting Daren to pay attention to Nolderan, and he makes a horizontal jump, rotating himself to the side in mid-air, and propelling his feet into the monster's back. As the orc gets knocked off-balance, the ex-sage falls to the ground, on his left shoulder. Daren immediately seizes the opportunity, and he drives his sword through the monster's head, while Nolderan quickly rolls to the side, in order to avoid getting bludgeoned by another orc's mace. As soon as the ex-sage gets up, he feints an attack with one of his swords, pretending to do a full swing from the left side, and just as the orc raises his shield to defend himself, Nolderan's second sword comes swinging for the monster's neck from the right, cutting his head off in one move.

While I haven't really recovered from my state of alcohol-induced dizziness just yet, I can't really just stand here and do nothing for the rest of the fight, either.

I decide that it's time for me to join the battle as well, so I aim my crossbow at one of the orcs that Leila is fighting.

 It's a bit difficult to aim from this distance, while the orc is moving, but luckily, I've spent some points in my combat technique skill, so I could accurately predict how the monster would move, after a few seconds of watching him. The bolt from my crossbow hits the orc straight through the slit of his helmet, and it kills him instantly.

As I look to see how the others are doing, I notice that the rest of the monsters are already dead, and that my teammates are now assembling near the woods, so we can go and fight the orc mages and their captain together.

"We sure made short work of these so-called 'elite' warriors, didn't we?" Nolderan says, and then he laughs.

"Not yet," Daren says. "There are still five mages waiting in the woods. And their captain's fighting skill is far superior to that of his subordinates. Let's just hurry up and get to them before they--"

Daren suddenly gets interrupted by the sound of a loud horn, coming from the direction of the orc captain, which makes us all cover our ears, to dampen some of the noise.

"Crap!" Arraka says, as soon as the orc captain stops blowing in the horn. "I forgot to check above us. Wyvern riders incoming. Wyvern riders incoming!"

I didn't manage to hit the orc right through the slit of his helmet, like I wanted, but my crossbow was powerful enough that it didn't matter, and the bolt went straight through the enemy's head gear, penetrating his skull, and killing him on the spot.

Unfortunately, the orc's helmet is too durable, and the crossbow bolt bounces right off it, without even moderately inconveniencing the warrior. Then again, even that small window of opportunity was enough for Leila to jump in for the kill, and to slit the orc's throat with one of her daggers.

 I try to predict which way he will move, and I shoot at him, but the crossbow bolt misses by a considerable margin. I guess that shooting moving targets from this distance is going to be a little more difficult than I thought. Maybe I should hold my fire for now, before I hit Leila by accident. Luckily, it doesn't take long until Leila manages to catch the orc on the wrong foot, and she quickly takes advantage of this by slitting his throat with one of her daggers.

 We all turn our heads upwards, and we see ten black wyverns quickly diving down from the clouds in which they'd been hiding until now. Each of the creatures is ridden by an orc wearing regular leather armor, and holding either a long spear or a crossbow in their hands. Wyverns are smaller versions of dragons that have a body length of fifteen feet, with their wings spanning around twenty feet. They are far less intelligent than dragons, their scales are a lot less durable, and they cannot breathe fire, but other than that, their appearance is rather similar.  Once the wyvern riders realize that we've already spotted them, they slow down their descent, and they begin to circle around the skies, waiting for the right moment to strike.

"Flower, Illuna and I will take care of the wyverns," Kate says. "The rest of you can't fly, so you won't be able to help us. I think you should all go and deal with the mages, before they call for more reinforcements."

"Maybe you're right," Daren says. "At least we've forced them to reveal the ace up their sleeve, so they shouldn't be able to surprise us with any more-- DAMN IT!!!"

As Daren was finishing his sentence, a very large blue circle appeared on the ground, in the area surrounding us, and a dim blue light is now slowly starting to envelop us.

"Get out of the summoning circle!" Daren shouts. "Get out, now!"

 I manage to get out of harm's way in time, and before the monster gets to attack me a second time, Leila stabs him from behind, with one of her daggers, forcing him to turn her way once more.

 We all rush out as fast as we can, and when we look back, we see that the blue light has filled the whole area above the circle, up to a height of nearly thirty feet, and it has gotten ten times brighter than before. Soon afterwards, the earth starts to tremble, and a very large creature gradually materializes itself from thin air, within the area that we just left, as the circle and the bright light fade away.

Once we get a clear look at it, we realize that the creature which has been summoned by the dragon's mages is without a doubt, a red-eyed mammoth. Towering above us, at an impressive thirty feet of height, the creature is now staring at us, with its bright red eyes, as if it's still trying to decide whether it should attack us or not. Red-eyed mammoths are generally not known for their aggressive behavior, despite their menacing looks, but a summoned creature is forced to obey any order given by its masters, so it most likely won't be long until this creature will try to trample us all to death.

Mammoths, in general, are only slightly larger than elephants, and the only major difference between the two species, in terms of appearance, is the fact that mammoths have much larger tusks, and their skin is typically covered with wool. Red-eyed mammoths, on the other hand, are much larger, they can only be found on the Northern Continent, and they are notorious for their fierceness in battle, when they fight to protect their territory. Their skins are completely armored, being far more durable than elven steel, and when they fight, they use their trunks like huge mallets, to smash their enemies, while they use their tusks as spears, to impale any remaining survivors of their onslaught.

 As the mammoth roars loudly, I can suddenly feel the presence of the orcs and ogres disappearing from the forest, due to them teleporting out of the area, just like last time.

"The mages and the captain are gone, by the way," Arraka says. "Just thought I'd let you know."

"Yes, Arraka, we all know that," Illuna says. "It's not like they took any effort to hide their auras anymore for the past minute. The mages were probably only brought here to summon this beast, and nothing else. Let's go deal with the wyverns, before anyone else shows up."

Flower then jumps into the air, and she propels herself upwards with her fire jets, as Kate jumps on a flying platform made of ice, while she creates an ice cage around herself, in order to make sure that she won't fall off.

 "You're going to have to deal with the mammoth yourselves, while we fight the wyverns," Kate says. "Don't take any stupid risks."

"Easier said than done," Daren says.

"We'll manage, don't worry," Nolderan says. "There hasn't been a monster yet that Daren and I failed to defeat, while fighting together. You just go follow your banshee friend, and do what you need to do."

Kate nods, curtly, and then she lifts her cage into the air, following Illuna towards the wyvern riders. As Kate heads for the skies, the rest of us stand our ground, and we look at the mammoth, which has been notably silent since its roar from earlier. The creature is not moving at all, and it's simply staring at us, waiting for our move.

"So..." Hadrik says. "Do you guys think that we should attack it, or?..."

 "I think that the creature is waiting to see what we'll do, before it takes any action," I say. "Typically, when you encounter a red-eyed mammoth, it should be enough to slowly back away from it, while maintaining eye-contact, and it would leave you alone, but I'm not sure what happens when it's been specifically instructed to kill us by its summoner. Let's try backing away, for now. With a little luck, maybe it won't attack us."

"Well..." Hadrik says. "You're the creature expert. Come on, everyone, let's back up a little."

We all take a few steps back, slowly, while keeping our eyes on the monster, and we try to observe its reaction. The mammoth keeps standing there, looking at us, for a while, and then all of a sudden, it begins to run towards us, in an attempt to trample us under its feet.

"So much for that plan," Hadrik says. "Get ready to fight!"

The dwarf then dashes towards the creature, and he jumps up in the air, trying to punch it in the head. The mammoth, however, sees him coming, and it stops in its tracks, raising its trunk, so it can defend itself. As soon as Hadrik gets into the monster's range of attack, the mammoth swings its trunk at him from above, with incredible force, sending the dwarf crashing into the ground.

 "One hit from that trunk, and we're goners," Daren says, as he looks at the hole in the ground, made by Hadrik when he fell. "I wouldn't recommend attacking the mammoth unless you're really confident in your evasion skills. Barry, neither of your weapons would be able to get through this creature's thick armored skin, so you'd better stay out of this. Leila, the enchantments on your daggers are a little better, so you could give it a shot, if you want to come with us."

"I'll come with you," Leila writes.

"Good," Daren says. "Let's hurry. I'm not sure how long Hadrik can keep the mammoth busy on his own."

As Daren, Nolderan and Leila head towards the mammoth, I suddenly remember that I came upon a page detailing the weaknesses of red-eyed mammoths in my notebook, while I was reading through my notes, for the arena. Should I go get the notebook? I'm certainly not going to be of much use out here, at this rate. Okay, it's settled. I'll go get the notebook.

 I rush towards my tent, and once I reach it, I open up the zipper. On my way there, I couldn't help but notice that Melindra's tent had remained closed since the battle has started. There's no way that she didn't hear those loud horns from before, or the sounds from all the fighting. Which means that she's just pretending to still be asleep, so she doesn't have to give away the fact that she can't control the power of her wind magic. 

Whatever. I don't have time to think about her. I have other things to do right now.

I quickly step inside my tent, and I open my backpack. Then, I take out my notebook from it and I flip through the pages, until I reach the paragraphs about the mammoths. And finally, here is what I was looking for. The red-eyed mammoth section. But, what does it say under 'Weaknesses'? Let's see...

 "You know what they say," I tell Hadrik. "There's no time like the present!"

I then raise my crossbow, and shoot the mammoth in the head. The crossbow bolt simply bounces off the creature's forehead, without so much as scratching its surface, but my little stunt did not go completely unnoticed, as it seems that I've managed to get the monster's undivided attention. The mammoth stares directly into my eyes, and it begins to run towards me, in an attempt to trample me under its feet.

"Alright, little mammoth," Hadrik says, as he cracks his knuckles. "Let's see what you've got!"

The dwarf then dashes towards the creature, and he jumps up in the air, trying to punch it in the head.

Should I go get the notebook? I'm certainly not going to be of much use out here, at this rate. Okay, it's settled. I'll go get the notebook.

 I rush towards my tent, and once I reach it, I open up the zipper. On my way there, I couldn't help but notice that Melindra's tent had remained closed since the battle has started. There's no way that she didn't hear those loud horns from before, or the sounds from all the fighting. Which means that she's just pretending to still be asleep, so she doesn't have to give away the fact that she can't control the power of her wind magic. 

Whatever. I don't have time to think about her. I have other things to do right now.

I quickly step inside my tent, and I open my backpack. Then, I take out my notebook from it and I flip through the pages, until I reach the paragraphs about the mammoths. And finally, here is what I was looking for. The red-eyed mammoth section. But, what does it say under 'Weaknesses'? Let's see...

ID: B2-Ch10a-Weakness
TEXT:

 Apparently, the mammoth's main weakness is at the very base of its trunk, on the underside. Unlike regular mammoths, this is where this type of creature has its nostrils, so that part is basically lacking any sort of armor. One good stab in that area should do some serious damage to the creature's airway, but I'm not sure how one would go about doing that, without getting smashed into the ground by the trunk.

The mammoth's eyes are also a weakness, but the eyelids are pretty thick, so it would take quite some effort to get through them. The creature only needs to close its eyes to protect itself, so as far as weaknesses go, this one isn't all that useful.

I can't really find any other information that could help us in this situation, so I decide to place the notebook back inside my backpack, and then I exit the tent. Looking at the battleground, I see that the mammoth is still busy defending itself from Hadrik, while mostly ignoring the fact that Daren, Nolderan and Leila are all trying to cut through its thick skin, by slashing at its legs. There are a few more holes in the ground now than when I went inside my tent, but apparently this hasn't stopped Hadrik from jumping at the monster some more, and then getting smashed into the ground over and over.

 What now, then?... Nobody except Hadrik would be able to reach high enough in order to attack the mammoth's eyes or its nostrils, but the dwarf seems to have his hands full at the moment. Kate, Flower and Illuna are still fighting the wyvern riders in the sky, so they won't be able to provide assistance. If only we had someone else who could fly in our team... Hold on, what am I saying? There is someone else.

"Hey, Melindra, can you hear me?" I shout, while I look towards Melindra's tent.

I can see no movements inside the tent, or anything else that might confirm the fact that she's heard me. After a few more seconds of silence, I continue.

"Okay, you don't need to answer me," I say. "I just have a little favor to ask. Remember how you made us all fly over the wall of Thilias, with your wind magic? Well, I was thinking that maybe you might have a way to make me fly that would also give me some manner of control. You know, like some semi-intelligent air-currents that react to my movements or something. I've also had access to elementalist wind magic two times before, and I think it should be theoretically possible to cast such a spell. You've been practicing this type of magic for six hundred years, so surely you must know how to do something like this by now, right?"

 I wait for a few seconds, to see if I get any reaction, but still, the only answer I get is silence.

"Listen," I say. "I'm not asking you to join the battle. You don't need to give yourself away or anything. All I'm asking is that you cast a spell on me that will allow me to fly."

Still no answer.

"Come on, Melindra," I say. "I know you can hear me!"

I wait for another three seconds, but there are no sounds coming from inside the tent.

"Melindra!!!" I shout.

All of a sudden, I can feel several air currents circling around me, similar to the ones I felt when Melindra raised me in the air for the first time. Then, only a few seconds later, my body gets lifted from the ground, and I start to float several feet above the soil. When I move my hands around, a little, I notice that the air currents are reacting to my movements, and changing my direction accordingly. If I raise my arms in the air, the air currents propel me upwards. If I lower them, I slowly come to a halt. The currents also seem to be taking into account the way I lean my body, and the way I move my legs when they establish what direction I need to go in.

#if(v_b2_ch10_toast == 1 && v_b2_ch9_drink == 1) {
 Obviously, they're not going to be as responsive as the currents I was using to lift me from the ground back when I was using my stat device's emergency mode, due to the fact that these particular air currents need to wait for my movements, before they change my direction and speed, but it's much better than what I would have expected, from a spell of this kind. I could still do without all the nausea I'm getting every time I do a quick turn, but that's probably due to my current drunken state, and not the fault of the spell.

"You have my thanks!" I shout, from up above, towards Melindra, and then I move higher into the air, in order to do a little test flight, before I head over to the mammoth.

I try to do as many moves as possible, so I can properly understand what causes me to change my direction, altitude and speed, because I can't afford to make any mistakes when I'm fighting the mammoth. One slip up, and its trunk will break all of my bones, with a single swing. My control over this spell needs to be perfect.

"Barry, look out!" I hear Kate's voice, from above.

As I look up, I suddenly notice that two of the wyvern riders are currently diving down towards me, with their spears at the ready, while Kate and Flower are too busy fighting their own wyverns to be able to help me in any way.

"We don't make deals with humans!" says one of the orcs. "We only serve Tyrath."

He then tries to impale me with his spear, but I dive out of his way, and then I try again to reason with him.

"Only Tyrath?" I say. "But what if I were to give you more money than the dragon? Couldn't that make you change your mind?"

"Our loyalty towards the dragon king cannot be broken by mere promises of wealth!" the orc says, furiously.

"That's all the gold I have," I tell him. "But it's not that bad of a deal, is it? Just leave us alone for a while, and this money is yours!"

"No, I've heard enough of your 'deal', human," the orc says. "Come, brother, let us finish off this insolent wretch."

The two wyverns are now once again diving towards me, while their riders are readying their spears.

 As I take my gold pouch out of my pocket and open it, I notice the fact that I also have a few gems inside it. If I show these orcs only the gold, I will probably not be able to buy them off, but a single one of these gems should be enough for them to live the rest of their lives without any worries.

I decide to take out a large ruby from my pouch, and I hold it in front of the orcs, so they can see it clearly.

"I have many more of these in my backpack," I say, "so I wouldn't mind parting with one or two for the sake of a temporary alliance. I'm willing to offer you both this ruby, in advance, and if you actually help me by driving back the other orcs, I will also give you a shiny diamond to go along with it. What do you say?"

"Your offer is tempting, human," the second orc says, without being able to fully hide the greed in his eyes. "But what would we orcs do with such treasure? Where else would we live our lives, if not in Tyrath's domain? It's not like any of the human cities would ever accept us within their walls."

 "I hear that Fyron is taking in refugees," I say. "You know about Fyron, right?"

"The goblin general?" the orc asks, in a thoughtful voice. "Yes... I do know about him. I heard that his camp has been doing better in these past few years. I also heard that he accepts all types of monsters, nowadays, not only goblins. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to go pay him a visit..."

"Do you realize what you are saying?" says the first orc, shocked. "What you speak of is treason!"

"Is it really?" the second orc says. "Tyrath is barely giving us enough money to afford our food and weapons. Why are you so loyal to him? If we accept this human's offer, we could live like kings! Think about it, brother."

 "You are no brother of mine," the first orc says, with pure hatred in his eyes, and he dives towards his former companion, with his spear aimed for his heart.

The second orc manages to raise himself into the air, before the other one reaches him, and he pushes his spear into his comrade's chest, making him fall off his wyvern, to his death.

"Let this be the first sacrifice for our alliance, human," the surviving orc says, while raising his bloody spear in the air.

"Here is a ruby, for your trouble," I say, as I toss him the ruby I was holding in my hand earlier, and the orc catches the gem with both his hands. "As promised, I will also give you a diamond, when the other orcs are dead."

"Traitor!" shouts another orc from the air, as he also dives with his wyvern towards us, in an attempt to impale his old ally with his spear.

The betrayer orc does not wait for his adversary to reach him, and he flies upwards, driving his spear through the enemy wyvern's chest, which makes it stop flapping its wings and sends it falling to the ground, along with its rider, killing them both.

 "What's going on, here?" Kate shouts, from a distance, as she sees what just happened.

"This orc is fighting on our side, as of now," I shout at her and Flower. "Make sure not to attack him!"

"Right..." Kate and Illuna both say, at the same time, and then they continue to fight their enemies in the sky.

"I'll go deal with the mammoth, now," I tell my new orc ally. "You know what to do."

I then leave the orc behind, and I fly to a lower altitude, closer to the mammoth that Hadrik and the others are still fighting.

I then rotate my body upwards and begin to move my legs in a circular motion, similarly to how I would move them if I were trying to keep myself afloat in a lake, while in a vertical position. This stops my momentum and it changes my direction, so that I can now face my enemies properly.

It's a good thing that I can mostly control my direction and speed without my arms, because this allows me to use my crossbow in mid-flight. I also noticed that the skills I gained by flying aircrafts in the past are proving really useful when trying to control these types of flight spells. It would have probably taken me a lot longer to get accustomed to flying like this, if I never flew a plane before.

 Unfortunately, aiming at very rapidly moving targets, while I'm flying myself, is not as easy as it may sound. I somehow manage to waste every one of my shots, and I don't have the time to reload.

I attempt to parry one of the orc's spears and to make a rush for him, but the second wyvern rider takes advantage of my momentary distraction, and he dives with his spear right into my stomach, temporarily freezing my movements, because of the pain. As I am still standing there, floating in mid-air, the orc quickly takes his spear out of me, and then he drives it through my throat, killing me a few moments afterwards.

Now that there is only one enemy left, I use my crossbow to drive him in the direction that I want him to go, and then I quickly dive for him from above, driving my blade in the back of his neck, before he even has the chance to parry my strike with his spear.

Shapeshifting?... Against a red-eyed mammoth? Didn't Golmyck say that he'd ban him from the tournament if he were to turn himself into anything much bigger than his current size?

I don't have time to think about this much longer, because the mammoth is now fully focused on smashing me with its trunk, and I'm barely even getting a moment's respite between two consecutive swings. When the monster wears itself out a little, and it slows down its rhythm, I take the opportunity to look down and see what Hadrik's been up to.

Apparently, Hadrik has turned himself into a giant snail... And he's just crawling on the ground at a very low speed... Oh man, I sure hope he's not messing with me, right now.

As I look down, I notice that Hadrik is finally done with his shapeshifting, and he is now back in his dwarf form, standing with his feet in the slime that his snail form left behind. He has his arms raised, and he is looking straight at me.

"Alright, Barry!" Hadrik shouts. "Now try to make the mammoth swing its trunk over here!"

Now I'm finally understanding what he was trying to do. The particular breed of giant snail that Hadrik turned into has a kind of slime that dries almost instantly, and becomes incredibly sticky, which is why it is often used as base material for many types of glues. Since Hadrik has his feet in the slime, he should now be able to grab onto the mammoth's trunk, without having to worry about being lifted into the air afterwards.

"Nice thinking!" I tell Hadrik. "I'll be right over!"

I then dive towards him, and I just float there, baiting the mammoth to attack me. The monster immediately takes the bait, and it swings its trunk with full force in our direction. I fly out of the way at the last second, and Hadrik quickly grabs onto the trunk, with both hands, without letting go.

"Now's your chance, Barry!" Hadrik says. "Quick! I don't know how long this glue will hold."

As the ground below the dwarf is already starting to crack, from the force of the mammoth trying to pull away its trunk, I quickly fly upwards, in order to attack the beast's weak spot.

As the ground below the dwarf is already starting to crack, from the force of the mammoth trying to pull away its trunk, I quickly fly upwards, in order to attack the beast's weak spot.

 I reach the area at the base of the trunk as fast as I can, and I try to identify the nostrils on its underside. As soon as I see them, I drive my scimitar into one of them, in an attempt to irreparably damage the creature's airways. As the mammoth screams, I drive my blade further inside, while twisting it continuously. Soon, the screams of the creature start to turn into gasps of air, as the damage that I did to its airways is finally starting to have a visible effect.

I take my scimitar out of the monster and I fly away, while the mammoth is still desperately trying to breathe. After about ten seconds, the creature's gasps for air start to get faster and shorter, until they eventually stop, and the mammoth falls completely silent, as it slowly crashes to the ground, causing a small earth tremor due to the enormous size of its body.

I try to shoot a few more bolts, but the creature just closes its eyes, which makes my efforts completely pointless. It looks like I'll need to use my dagger for this to work. 

I dive into one of the mammoth's eyes at full speed, and I thrust my dagger into it, with as much force as I could possibly muster.

I was not strong enough for my weapon to reach the eye, however, and the blade got stuck in the eyelid. While I try to get it out, Hadrik finally loses his grip, and the mammoth's trunk comes swinging straight at me, squishing me like a bug, and killing me on the spot.

 As I slowly land on the ground, besides the monster's carcass, Hadrik lets out a hearty laugh. Taking a good look at him, I see that he has a black eye, from all the beating he's taken during this fight.

"This is it!" Hadrik says. "It's for moments like these that I've joined this tournament. I knew that staying in this group was the right decision! There's just no running out of powerful enemies to fight, with you people!"

"That was quite the impressive combination you two had back there," Nolderan says. "I did not know that any of you had the ability to fly."

"Yeah, well if there's anything Barry excels at, it's resourcefulness!" Hadrik says. "He made that abundantly clear after somehow managing to wiggle his way out of the arena alive, against all odds."

"An arena, you say?..." Nolderan asks. 

 "Oh, right, we didn't tell you about that," Hadrik says. "Back in Thilias, we all had to fight in an arena event, and the owner of that arena really had it in for Barry and Leila. Or rather, he wanted to make them into the stars of the show. He literally threw everything he had at them, and they only had some weaklings as teammates, but they still managed to make it out victorious. We'll fill you in on the details later."

"I sure hope that the orc captain is not planning to teleport back with even more reinforcements..." Daren says. "We really need to find a way to stop them from escaping. Otherwise they'll just keep coming at us over and over, until we're completely worn out."

"Or you could try to do a better job at hiding your tracks, from now on," Nolderan says. "If they managed to find you for a second time, then you people probably left them a really obvious trail to follow."

"Yeah, you're probably right..." Daren says. "Now that I think about it, the only way they could have found us this fast is if they teleported back to the location of our previous battle, and pursued our tracks all the way to our camp."

"You mean, like the one that the golden fox cast on us before we arrived in Thilias?" Daren says. "I don't think that's the case. As a white mage, I should be able to detect these sorts of spells better than anyone. The fox is a really powerful spirit from the magical plane, so her spells would be much more difficult to detect than normal, but these are just some lowly monsters. I really shouldn't have any problems detecting spells cast by one or two orc mages."

"Hey, look, your elementalists are coming back down!" Nolderan says. "I think they're done killing the wyvern riders. No, wait, there's one more left. He's coming down for us. Get ready!"

"Hold on!" I say. "Don't attack him. That one is working with us!"

"He is?..." Daren asks, confused.

"Yeah, I bribed him with some gems, and he switched sides in the middle of the battle," I say.

"Hah!" Hadrik says. "What did I tell you about Barry and his resourcefulness? It's like he has this constant supply of crazy ideas in his head, and whenever he needs one, he just pulls it out, like it's nothing.

Once they get close enough to our position, Flower and Kate dismiss their fire jets and ice cage, and they land on the ground, next to us.

"Is it over?" Kate asks. "Are they all dead? Or is there some third wave of enemies still waiting to ambush us?"

"Nah," Arraka says. "There's no one else. I even checked above, this time around. If they're going to bring new reinforcements, I doubt that it's going to be any time soon, after the beating they've taken in this fight."

 As Kate and Flower come landing on the ground, next to us, the wyvern rider stops a dozen feet above the ground, as the wyvern keeps slowly flapping its wings, to maintain its altitude.

"All of the other orcs are dead, human," the orc says. "I have fulfilled my end of the bargain."

"And now, I will fulfill mine," I tell him, as I take a diamond out of my gold pouch, and throw it to him.

The orc catches the diamond in his hand, he studies it from a few angles, to make sure that it's not fake, and then he puts it in the sash that he's wearing around his waist.

"I must leave you now, human," the orc says. "Before any other of Tyrath's troops come to this location, and find out that I am still alive. Perhaps we will meet again."

"Yeah," I say. "I'll make sure to say hi, if we ever visit Fyron's camp."

The orc nods, and then he utters a command to his wyvern, which makes it go up, and then as far away from this place as possible.

 "Is it over?" Kate asks. "Are they all dead? Or is there some third wave of enemies still waiting to ambush us?"

 For the next few minutes, Daren spends his time magically healing all of our bruises, including Hadrik's black eye. When he is just about done, I see a tent getting opened in the distance, as Melindra slowly comes out of it. Just as she exits the tent, I can feel the air currents around me fading away, until they disappear completely.

"Look who finally decided to show up..." Kate says.

"Hey, Melindra!" Flower shouts, as Melindra is already advancing towards us. "Over here! You missed the fight! Also, Daren's old enchanting master came to visit. He's standing right here, next to me. His name is Nolderan."

"Is this another member of your team, or?..." Nolderan asks us.

Melindra overhears Nolderan's question, while she's still making our way towards us, and she answers it before any of us get a chance to say anything.

"I am only a travelling maiden, looking to go back home to her sickly father," Melindra says, in a loud voice, while smiling politely. "These brave warriors have offered to escort me to my hometown, and now I am travelling with them."

When she reaches our position, she extends her hand, towards Daren's old master, inviting him to kiss it.

"Pleased to meet you!" she says, still smiling.

 "Likewise, milady," Nolderan says, as he grabs her hand, kissing it softly, and then releases it. "May I ask which way you are headed?"

"Oh, it's just a small town," Melindra says. "You probably haven't heard of it."

"We are taking her to a city called Ollendor," Daren says.

Melindra frowns at him, when she sees how easily he's given away our destination, but it doesn't look like Daren noticed.

"Ollendor?" Nolderan says, surprised. "We've actually passed that city on our way here! And it just so happens that I have a mage in my team that can cast teleportation magic. If you would come with me to my camp, I'm sure that I could convince him to teleport you to your destination, and you could save a few days from your journey. What do you say, Daren, would you like to meet my teammates?"

"I... suppose so..." Daren says. "But I'm not sure what the others have to say about this. Would everyone else also be okay with asking one of Nolderan's friends to teleport us to Ollendor?"

If people can't even rely on you to fight together with us, you can't just expect them to treat you as a member of the team. Seriously, why are you trying so hard to keep this a secret from everyone? What do you think they'll do when they find out? Do you think they're going to try to kill you?"

"As a matter of fact, I do!" Melindra says.

"You do?..." I ask her, confused. "But, why?"

}
#if(v_b2_ch10_traps == 1) {
 "I think you're worrying over nothing. Nolderan seems alright in my book."

"Ugh..." Melindra says. "I can't believe how much you people are willing to trust a guy you've only just met. Everyone is still treating me like I'm some outsider, but then this new mage comes along, and suddenly it's like he's already part of the team. What makes him so special?"

"Well," I say, "maybe if you told the others about the trouble you have with controlling your wind powers, they would trust you more.

"As a matter of fact, I do!" Melindra says.

"You do?..." I ask her, confused. "But, why?"

}
 "Because it's already happened once!" Melindra says. "There used to be this small group of people that I travelled with, for a while, a long time ago, and at a certain point they found out about my problem. They wanted to fix this issue by casting a white mage spell on me, which was supposed to help me by limiting the amount of energy I could use to power up each one of my spells. In theory, it could have worked, but I did not want to risk it, because a stillwater's aura is just too different from that of a normal mage, and you can't know what will happen. It could potentially be deadly for someone like me. I tried to explain this to them, but they wouldn't take me seriously. The bastards even tried to cast this spell on me while I was sleeping, without my permission. They may well have killed me, if I hadn't woken up to stop them!"

"I really don't think that Daren would try to cast that spell on you while you're sleeping," I say. "Especially if you explain to him why you think it might be risky for you..."

"Really?" Melindra says. "You guys practically forced me to take a deadly enchanter's oath, just so you'd agree to come along with me, and now you're expecting me to believe that you would suddenly be willing to prioritize my safety over your own, just because I'm asking you nicely?"

"Well, I've known about your problem and the risk it poses to us for quite a while, haven't I?" I say. "And yet, I never told Daren or anyone else about any of this."

#if(v_b2_ch10_toast == 1 && v_b2_ch10_traps == 0 && v_b2_ch9_drink == 1) {
 "I suppose not..." Melindra says, as she takes a small break to contemplate on my words. "But I'd still rather keep the others from knowing, at least until we reach Ollendor. It's not like I could help much in a battle, even if I wanted to, so I don't really see any need for them to know. And if this means that they'll keep hating me, then so be it."

"As you wish..." I say. "Either way, I think we're done, here, so I'll go pack up my tent. See you in a few minutes."

Once we're all done with our tents, we grab our backpacks, and we start following Nolderan towards his camp. According to his words, it shouldn't take us more than thirty minutes to reach it. Luckily, the battle with the mammoth has mostly sobered me up, so if anyone attacks us again on the way there, I won't have that problem to deal with, anymore.

Before we left, Melindra and I had a private conversation with Arraka, and we asked her to notify us if there were any magical traps on our way to Nolderan's camp. As we walk through the forest, we come upon a few more mages that are filling their backpacks with pinecones. However, these ones are all looking rather terrified when they see us, as if they were afraid that we'd attack them.

"Why do you suppose those mages were so scared to see us?" Daren says, as we walk past the pinecone collectors.

"Well, we're a pretty big group, so we must be looking quite intimidating to them," Hadrik says. "Maybe they think that we'll try to steal their cones."

 "Hey, Barry," Kate says. "There's something that I forgot to ask. How did you manage to cast that flight spell on yourself, earlier? Was it with the help of your stat device?"

As Kate finishes her question, I see Melindra right behind her, staring straight at me, with a menacing look in her eyes.

"Uh..." I say. "Yeah, that's right. It was the stat device."

"So you've finally managed to unlock your magic stats?" Kate says.

"No, it was only temporary, just like the last two times," I say. "The monster mages probably made a mistake when they cast the ritual, and they leaked a little too much energy my way."

"Oh, I see..." Kate says, looking somewhat disappointed.

"So, how did you come to know these allies of yours, master Nolderan?" Daren says.

"Oh, they're mostly people that I've met while doing mercenary work," Nolderan says. "Our group is rather diverse. We even have a banshee in the team. I'm sure that your own banshee will get along with her just fine."

"Yes, I always get along with other banshees," Illuna says, in a dry tone, while she looks towards Arraka's amulet.

"A banshee?" Hadrik asks. "How did you meet that one?"

"It's a long story," Nolderan says. "If you want, I'll tell it to you when we get there."

}
#if(v_b2_ch10_traps == 0) {
 "Arraka," Illuna says, all of a sudden. "Can you sense the camp? How many mages are there inside, waiting for us?"

"Five," Arraka says. "Including the banshee."

"And how strong are they?" Illuna asks.

"It's hard to tell," Arraka says. "since they all seem to be suppressing their auras, to avoid detection, but most of them appear to be on Nolderan's level of magic power."

"It's hard to tell because you are unable to do it, or because you don't want to do it?" Illuna asks her.

"You would accuse me of lying to you?" Arraka says, in a mocking tone. "Me? Your oldest friend and beloved mentor? I am shocked. Utterly shocked..."

Illuna frowns at the amulet, but she doesn't say anything.

"Your banshee friend doesn't seem to trust me much, does she?" Nolderan tells Daren.

"It doesn't seem like it..." Daren says.

"Do not worry," Illuna says. "I am suspicious of everyone. It's in my nature."

"Well, that is most certainly a good trait to have in an environment like this!" Nolderan says. "Especially for a banshee. Come, let us move forward. We will reach the camp soon."

#if(v_b2_ch10_traps == 1) {
 "Psst, Barry!" Melindra whispers to me, as she is now trailing about a dozen feet behind our group, along with Flower. "Over here!"

"What is it?" I say, in a low voice, as I join the two of them. "Did Arraka find any traps?"

"No, but we can sense how many mages there are waiting for us inside the camp," Melindra says. "There are five of them, including the banshee that the old man was talking about earlier."

"Hmm..." I say. "Five mages doesn't sound that bad."

"How powerful are these five mages, exactly?" Illuna asks.

"It's hard to tell," Arraka says. "since they all seem to be suppressing their auras, to avoid detection, but most of them appear to be on Nolderan's level of magic power."

"It's hard to tell because you are unable to do it, or because you don't want to do it?" Illuna asks her.

"You would accuse me of lying to you?" Arraka says, in a mocking tone. "Me? Your oldest friend and beloved mentor? I am shocked. Utterly shocked..."

 Illuna frowns at the amulet, but she doesn't say anything.

"I think she might be telling the truth," Melindra says. "Their levels of power look the same to me as she's described them."

"I still think that she's hiding something," Illuna says. "But I suppose that we won't find out what exactly that is until we reach our destination and see for ourselves. Let's catch up with the others. We're starting to look a little suspicious."
