"Arraka, wake up!" Illuna says. "Barry already completed the task you gave him ten minutes ago. If you don't give him something to do, he'll start testing that obnoxious spell of his with the blinding flash of light over and over again, and none of us want that."

"Hey," I say, "you should be grateful that I tested that spell as many times as I did. The last thing you'd want during a tense fight would be for me to blind you by accident because I didn't practice enough. That spell has very delicate timing, you know."

"I'm sure it does," Illuna tells me in a dismissive tone, and then she picks up the amulet again so she can speak louder into it. "Arraka, seriously, what are you doing? We've been calling out to you for ages and you haven't responded at all. Don't make me spin you."

"Alright, alright!" Arraka says, in an exasperated tone. "I'll give Barry his blasted task. Just give me one more minute. I'm kind of in the middle of something."

"Let me guess," Illuna says. "You're trying to find an explosion spell that requires less energy to cast, so that you can take us by surprise the next time when you try to escape from the amulet. Is that it?"

"Wrong," Arraka says. "If there were a faster explosion spell, I would have used it years ago. But if you have to know, I am currently trying to create a modified version of my soul absorption spell where instead of absorbing the host's soul, I fuse with them, and we both get equal control of the body."

 "You mean... like me and Flower?" Illuna asks, perplexed. "But... why? What could you possibly have to gain from doing something like this on purpose? I thought you hated it when you got fused with Therius by accident."

"I did," Arraka says. "But you see, the thing is that if I ever do escape from my amulet again, for whatever reason, I can't afford to take over Flower's body the same way as last time, because then you'd both essentially be dead, everyone would attack me to avenge you again, and I'd be forced to murder them all, for good this time."

"And why exactly would that be a problem for you?..." Illuna asks, still just as confused as before. "You've already killed us once. Why not just do it again?"

"Because then my whole plan to use you all to take my vengeance upon the gods would be ruined!" Arraka shouts. "I'm not going to get another opportunity like this in a million years! Where else do you think I'm going to find another clown troupe that has a personal beef with one of the gods and has a minimal chance of killing them with my guidance? You think I want to go back to my boring old plan of just killing them myself after I came up with a genius idea like this?"

 "You can't be serious..." Illuna says. "You're telling me that you're willing to live together with me AND Flower in the same mind, while sharing control of the body with both of us, just for the sake of your plan?"

"Yeah, sure, why not?" Arraka says, in a casual tone. "We can have the tea parties with biscuits and whatever in the morning, and then we'll do the murder sprees in the evening. I'm sure we can work something out."

"I'm sorry, but I am finding this very hard to believe..." Illuna says.

"As you should," Arraka tells her. "If you would have been so easily ready to trust the word of someone who already killed you once, then it would have meant that you've learned nothing from me during the years when you were my pupil."

 "Well, I personally believe Arraka," I say.

"See that?" Arraka tells Illuna. "Barry's a gullible moron. All I need to do is act friendly with him for a few days and he thinks I'm harmless. Aren't you glad that you didn't end up like him?"

"On that alone, I will have to agree with you," Illuna says, begrudgingly.

"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say," I tell them. "If you need me, I'll be over there, by those rocks, testing a few more spells."

I let Arraka focus on researching her new spell while I head to a more isolated part of our camp, which is perfect for me letting loose a little and experimenting with my newly acquired magic. During the two days since we've left the lessathi base, I've been spending as much time as possible cataloguing my available spells in my notebook and testing each one of them out, to make sure that I could indeed use them when required.

"Very good," Arraka says. "Then maybe you are not a completely lost cause after all. Now be a good boy and play with your spells for a few more minutes while I finish what I'm doing here."

"As if I wasn't going to do exactly that even without you telling me..." I say. "If you need me, I'll be over there, by those rocks."

 I've also tried out quite a few combinations of spells that I'd discovered while doing research with Brinhorn back in the days, but some of these turned out to be trickier than I thought. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that it's much easier to theorize on the effects of a spell combination than to actually manage to use it in practice. Combining spells is a really advanced technique, after all, and the stat device doesn't really have any built-in features to help me with this, since it was designed to cast the spells separately.

 The only way in which I can become accustomed to this is through repeated experimentation, just as I would have done if I were a regular mage. I suppose this is one rare thing for which Brinhorn genuinely deserves some praise. Whenever I came up with an outlandish idea for combining two or more spells, he almost always managed to make it work nearly effortlessly, and could follow my instructions perfectly. You could easily tell that he had spent countless amounts of hours practicing his magic, all for the purpose of one day surpassing Azarius.

 "Hey, Barry, you practicing your spells again?" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he passes by me with a bottle of ale in his hand. "If you're still in need of a test subject, I could lend you a hand for a minute. I've got nothing to do for the time being, and I'm just drunk enough to not consider the consequences of what I'm offering."

"Wow, yeah, that would be great!" I say, enthusiastically. "I actually do have a few targeted spells that can only be used on living beings which I haven't had the opportunity to try out yet. I've been begging Kate and Daren to let me test these on them for the past two days, but they never agreed!"

"So I've heard!" Hadrik says, as he takes another sip from his bottle, and then puts it on the ground.

Shortly afterwards, he steps away from the bottle, he turns to face me and he stretches his arms outwards, inviting me to cast a spell at him.

 "Well?" Hadrik says. "What are you waiting for? Give me your best shot!"

Just as I am about to cast one of my spells, Hadrik dashes away at an incredibly high speed, making it impossible for me to target him.

"Too slow, Barry!" Hadrik says. "Too slow."

"Didn't you say you were going to help me?..." I ask him, confused.

"I am helping you!" Hadrik says. "You think your enemies are just going to stand in place and politely ask you to cast your spells on them? It's much more realistic this way. Plus, I get to have more fun!"

 "Oh, so that's how it is..." I say, as I ready up another one of my spells and aim for him.

Before I get to cast anything, my stat device from my pocket suddenly starts beeping, letting me know that I've finally received some new stat points.

Perfect timing.

 I take out my stat device to stop the beeping, and then I put it back in my pocket again. While I was doing this, Hadrik was dashing repeatedly left and right, taunting me to make my move.

 I remember Arraka saying that Daren was using the flow of Hadrik's aura to predict his movements when they were dueling. It might be difficult for me to do the same thing, considering that I didn't get any aura training from Arraka, but maybe I can supplement some of her training with the stats from my device?

If not, then I suppose I could always try the brute force approach, by using my speed to close in on Hadrik and my reflexes to cast a spell at him before he dashes away. As long as I'm close enough, it should be easier to target him.

Or... I could just try to bluff him.

Alright, let's see what we've got, here.

Clearly, there has to be some sort of hint in the flow of Hadrik's aura that can show me where he will move next. All I need to do is find it. How hard can that be, right?

After just staring blankly at Hadrik for about thirty seconds, trying to figure out anything that could possibly help me predict his next movements, the dwarf finally gives up on his attempts to provoke me and he picks his bottle back up from the ground.

"Well, Barry, your minute is up," Hadrik says. "Maybe try a little harder next time, aye?"

 "Wait, at least let me cast one spell!" I tell him.

"Some other time, Barry," Hadrik says, and then he takes his leave.

Realizing that I won't get any more help from him, I decide to pull out my notebook again and to go back to cataloguing my available spells.

Let's see what we've got here...

Okay, so there's clearly something going on with his aura just before he dashes in any given direction. Logically speaking, I should be able to read these flows in order to predict his next movements, but I'll be damned if I can make any sense of it.

After about thirty seconds of just staring at Hadrik, trying to figure out where he'll run to next, the dwarf finally gives up on his attempts to provoke me and he picks his bottle back up from the ground.

 "Well, Barry, your minute is up," Hadrik says. "Maybe try a little harder next time, aye?"

Let's see what we've got here...

Okay, so there's clearly something going on with his aura just before he dashes in any given direction. If only I could figure out a pattern or something that could help me-- wait a minute, I think I got it!

At the moment, it's only a theory at best, but I don't have any time to confirm it, so I'll just have to go with my gut feeling on this one. It seems to me that the aura around the fingertips of his left hand is getting slightly pulled in the direction that he plans to run towards, briefly before he moves his legs. I also think I might be able to somewhat estimate how far he's gonna go, based on how quickly his aura gets pulled in the given direction.

I doubt I'll be able to get this right on the first try, so I'd better begin now and adjust my aim gradually with every new attempt.

I choose the quickest spell I have in my arsenal, which is a very weak dizziness spell that only slightly disorients you for a few seconds, and then I aim it at the spot where I think Hadrik is about to arrive. I miss my timing by about half a second, and the spell does not activate.

Still, that went much better than I thought it would. After only a few adjustments, I think I should be able to accurately predict where Hadrik is about to go.

 It takes me two more tries, but on the third attempt I manage to calculate Hadrik's exact position in advance, and I hit him straight on with my dizziness spell, which makes him actually stop in his tracks and place his hand on his head for a few moments.

"Whoa..." Hadrik says, as he looks at me. "Was that you? Is this a dizziness spell I'm feeling? Oh, the effect is gone already!"

"Yes, well, it's probably the weakest dizziness spell that exists, so it's not exactly very useful," I say, "but at least I was finally able to cast a targeted spell at someone, so from my point of view this experiment was a success!"

"Hey, in that case, I'm glad I could help!" Hadrik says, as he goes to pick up his bottle from the ground.

"Leaving already?" I say, with a hint of disappointment in my voice.

"Yeah, I'd say that was enough fun for one evening," Hadrik says. "If you're really in need of more experimenting, maybe we can find an orc patrol tomorrow or something for you to work with. They shouldn't be that hard to find, considering that Tyrath seems to have declared war on literally the whole of Varathia."

"I suppose..." I say.

"Alright, see you later, Barry!" Hadrik tells me, and then he leaves.

"Later," I say, simply, and then I pull out my notebook again, so I can get back to cataloguing my available spells.

 About ten or so minutes later, Arraka finally calls me to her, so that she can give me my new task.

"Alright, Barry-boy, let's see the fruits of your labor," Arraka says. "Go ahead and shoot a fire arrow at that tree over there."

"It's not going to work," I tell her. "I know what you're trying to do, but it's just not happening."

"Okay, I'll ask you one more time," Arraka says. "Did you or did you not cast spells in the ethereal plane by imagining the exact flow and intensity of each individual magical particle and then controlling them flawlessly?"

"Yes, but that is an entirely different plane of--"

"A simple 'yes' will suffice," Arraka interrupts me. "Now, can you think of a spell with an easier flow to control than 'fire arrow'?"

"Not really, but--"

"Then shut up and do it," Arraka says. "As long as you do exactly the same thing that you did on the ethereal plane, it will work."

I decide to accept Hadrik's challenge and to try to beat him at his own game instead of attempting to outsmart him.

As soon as I see him stopping in place for one second, I rush towards him as fast as I can, while readying my quickest spell from my arsenal, which is a very weak dizziness spell that only slightly disorients you for a few moments. Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough to catch him by surprise, so by the time I reached him, Hadrik was already gone.

I try to catch up to him a few more times, but the result is the same. He is just too quick for me to be able to close in on him, and in the end I am forced to give up the chase.

"Well... at least you tried your best!" Hadrik tells me, as he goes to grab his bottle from the ground, while I'm still breathing hard from all the running.

 "Hold on," I say to him. "I know I can do it if I try a bit harder!"

"Sorry, Barry, but your minute is up," Hadrik says. "Better luck next time, aye?"

As I watch Hadrik leave, I realize that I won't get any more help from him, so I decide to pull out my notebook again and to go back to cataloguing my available spells.

For the next thirty seconds or so, I attempt the same strategy, but now that Hadrik knows what I'm doing, it's much easier for him to give me the slip. In the end, even though I managed to catch up to him a few times, I was never quite fast enough to cast my spell at him before he got away.

As he gets hit by the spell, Hadrik puts his hand on his head for several seconds, likely in an attempt to stop his head from spinning.

"I can't believe it..." Hadrik says, as his dizziness seems to have gone away already. "I knew you had a bluff stat in your device and somehow still fell for it. Well, it won't happen twice in a row. Come on, Barry, tell me to stand in place again. I dare you!"

"Hey, I'm obviously not going to try the same lie twice," I say, "but, come to think of it, I did hear that if you don't move from that spot for more than a minute, you can become twice as strong as you are now."

"Uh-huh," Hadrik says, as I try to cast another spell on him but he dashes away. "That sounds fascinating. Please tell me more!"

 "Didn't you hear?" I tell him, as I keep trying to aim for him while he is constantly moving. "The invisible fairies of the woods have put a curse on this place so that anyone who runs too much will lose their eyesight forever!"

"That's perfectly fine!" Hadrik says, with a grin, as he continues to move around just as fast as before. "I always thought it was a bit unfair for me to be able to see my surroundings while Eiden always kept his eyes closed, so at least now we can finally have a fair match!"

"Stop trying to bluff him, you dope!" Arraka shouts at me, from a distance. "That trick of yours only works when you have the element of surprise on your side. He obviously knows you're trying to lie to him, so he's not going to fall for it anymore! Now stop messing around and practice your spells, already. You're making me lose my focus!"

 "Fine," I say. "You're the teacher."

I then take the appropriate stance and I stretch my arms forward, with my palms facing away from me, doing everything by the book, in order to make sure that Arraka can't blame me for the inevitable failure of this experiment.

So far, the particles are not following the proper direction and are going their own way, despite me doing everything correctly, but this was not unexpected. I've already experienced this before on the ethereal plane and I know how to fix it. All I need to do is follow their direction with my hands, and they will eventually fall back into place.

"That's interesting," Arraka says, as the magical particles from my spell are now rearranging themselves into the correct form. "I would have expected you to try to force the particles back into their proper position instead of following them. Where did you learn this technique from?"

"I learned it from an old hermit," I tell her, offhandedly, as I am still focusing on my spell. "I don't really remember what his name was. I don't think he ever told me, actually..."

"He had skills like this and he lived as a hermit?!" Arraka asks, shocked. "What an incredible waste of talent. If I ever get out of this amulet, he'll be one of the first people that I'll take on as my apprentices. Remind me to ask you for his address if I don't end up killing you by then."

 "Yeah, sure," I say, as I'm still casting the same spell. "So, can I cancel the spell now, or do I still need to keep this up for another-- whoa..."

While I was talking, a ridiculously small arrow made out of fire shot out of my hands and went straight for the tree that I was targeting. The flaming projectile hit the tree head on, but the intensity of it was so low that it barely made a scorch mark on the tree's bark before getting extinguished completely.

"Hahahaha, it worked!" I say, excitedly. "I can't believe it actually worked! You're a genius!"

"Of course I'm a genius!" Arraka says. "Did you seriously expect anything less from the spirit who killed half of the gods on the magical plane?"

"I swear I'll never doubt you again!" I say. "Wow, I'm still in shock. This is simply unbelievable!"

"No..." Illuna says, looking at me as if I'd gone completely mad. "What is unbelievable is that the two of you are getting excited over a fire spell that couldn't even burn the bark of a tree. Two whole days of following Arraka's nonsensical instructions and this is the result? How can you not see that she is making a fool out of you?"

"Why would she be making a fool out of me?" I ask Illuna, confused. "Every part of her training so far has made perfect sense."

 "You've got to be joking..." Illuna says. "Just a short while ago, I was watching you literally banging your head against that tree a thousand times in a row. You're really trying to tell me that this had anything to do with you learning magic?"  

"No, of course not," I say. "It had nothing to do with me learning magic."

"Then why would you do it?!" Illuna asks, looking as if she's finally losing her cool.

"Because he's a generalist," Arraka says. "He's the only one in this group who understands enough magical theory that I don't need to jump through hoops to make him follow my instructions, no matter how idiotic and nonsensical they may seem to the rest of you. He may have disagreed with how well my training would work in practice, but he knew that there were no flaws in the theory behind it. He would have never accepted to do any of this otherwise."

"Yeah," I say, "the whole thing with hitting my head against the tree so that I could imprint my aura onto it and make it an easier target for my spell was something that I tried to do many years before I could use magic. It's not really a very well-known method of training, because it's hard to take seriously, but it can have an immensely positive effect on mages with very weak magical power who can't learn to cast spells any other way."

"But why would you need to go through all this trouble NOW, when you can already cast magic?" Illuna says. "Why not simply cast it through the use of your stat device?"

 " 'Fire arrow' is not on his list of spells," Arraka says. "That was the whole point of this exercise. I made him cast the easiest spell that couldn't possibly be included in his device, because his stat booster was invented over six hundred years ago and the fire arrow spell was only created a hundred years later. I don't think you understand just how much of a leap forward this is. Until now, Barry was under the impression that casting anything other than the spells included in his device was fundamentally impossible. Now that we've clearly established that he can cast other spells as well, this has opened up an infinite amount of new options for him. With enough practice, he might be able to learn to cast some of the special spells designed by me, and hell, maybe even primordial spells. It's only a matter of time at this point."

"I... didn't realize you two were actually thinking so far ahead," Illuna says, now appearing to have calmed down.

"Well... why wouldn't we?" I say. "We ARE trying to kill a god, aren't we?"

"Yes..." Illuna says. "I suppose we are. And the fact that we seem to be getting realistically closer to this goal makes me doubt my own sanity more and more with every passing day..."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "You ain't seen nothing yet! Stick with me and soon, killing a few gods will feel like an ordinary afternoon!"

 "Hey, Hadrik!" I tell the dwarf as he is passing by us, looking just as puzzled as Illuna was in the beginning. "Pour me a glass of ale, would you? I just cast my first fire arrow! See that scorch mark over there on the tree? That was me! Hahahaha!"

"Uhm... good for you, man!" Hadrik says, as he pats me on the back, very unconvinced. "Good for you!"

Soon after Hadrik takes out the glass, Diane joins us as well, and then Kate and Daren also head over to us to see what the commotion was all about. It took me some time to explain to them why casting this insignificant spell was such a big deal for me, and to convince them that I hadn't completely taken leave of my senses when I agreed to smash my head against a tree for a whole hour, but once I cleared up everything, we all sat down in a circle and enjoyed the rest of our evening, taking a brief rest from all of our trainings.

"So, Barry, now that you can cast any spell you want, without any limitations, what are you planning to try next?" Flower asks me, as she subtly tries to pick up a bottle of dwarven ale, but then her eyes briefly turn blue and she slaps her own hand away from the bottle. "If you want some suggestions, I highly recommend the spell where you make a huge dragon out of flames that you can use to--"

"I doubt that's how it works," Illuna interrupts her. "He might not be limited by the list of spells provided by his device anymore, but his magical power level is still very low. This means that he will only be able to cast very weak spells for the time being."

 "Exactly," Arraka says. "See, this is why the spells made by me are so great, compared to the ones created by all the other simpletons. With my original spells, you are not limited by the amount of energy that you have at your disposal. You can make the spells as strong or as weak as you want, depending on how much energy you want to spend on them."

"Now you're beginning to sound like a salesperson that is trying much too hard to sell their faulty products," Illuna says. "We only just saw that the fire arrow that Barry cast works the same way, so clearly your spells are not as unique as you're making them out to be."

"Pfft..." Arraka says. "Fire arrow doesn't count. That's one of the newer spells. Show me a spell from before five thousand years ago that does what my spells do, and then we'll talk."

"Aaanyway..." I say. "To answer Flower's question, I suppose that what I'd want to try out first are some spells with easier flows to recreate, so that I can get some more practice before I begin with the complicated ones. I'd probably start with something like the frog summoning spell from the Beginner's guide to summoning magic. Hmm, or maybe the floating dagger spell that those scam artists like to use when they pretend to be juggling. Oh, or I could try the one spell where you can make little sparks fly in the air like tiny fireworks!"

"Or... here's an idea," Arraka says. "How about you try out a spell that isn't completely useless?"

 "Look, I know that you all hate it," I say, "but it's important for our timing to be perfect if we want to use this in battle effectively. As soon as I say the code words 'Daren, catch!' you all need to close your eyes for exactly one second, no matter what you are doing on the battlefield, or else you'll get blinded along with the enemy. This is a very old spell that they don't really teach anymore nowadays, so most people won't be expecting it the first time when I use it against them. That's why it's necessary for us to do it well from the very first try, before we lose the element of surprise."

"Listen, Barry..." Hadrik says, "I get that you're really excited about finally obtaining your magical stats, but it feels like this is the only thing you've been talking about for two days straight. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to forget about your magic for an hour or two and do something else for a change."

"Come on, Hadrik, don't be like that!" Daren says. "Let Barry have his moment. The man's been dreaming of becoming a mage his entire life. It's perfectly fine for him to get a little over-excited. And it's not like we mind, with the exception of his blinding light spell. That one is admittedly getting a little obnoxious."

 "Wolford's daze," Kate says. "It is widely considered to be simultaneously the strongest and weakest dizziness spell that exists. There is essentially no magical counter or protection against it, but its effects can easily be rendered useless through non-magical means. All you need to do is focus your eyes on three different places in front of you within the span of five seconds and the spell will be canceled, but if you don't do that, you will get a headache the likes of which you've probably never had the pleasure to experience in your lifetime. The main drawback is that the spell is incredibly difficult to learn, and most people won't bother to spend so much time practicing something that can so easily be countered by a regular person with no magic, just by looking around a little."

"You know..." I say. "It would really help me out if you guys allowed me to cast some of these targeted spells on you once or twice, just so I could get a feel of how they work before using them in combat. I know you don't really like the idea, but--"

"I'm sorry, Barry," Kate says. "I know you mean no harm, and I value your friendship, but simply the thought of being experimented on again after what I went through at the Beacon as a child is-- I'm just not very keen on repeating that experience."

"No, no, that's totally understandable," I say. "My bad. I should have thought about this before making that request."

 "As for me," Daren says, "the main problem is that many of my protection spells have limited uses per day, so I'd rather not cancel them unless it's absolutely necessary. And casting your spells on me while my protections are still up wouldn't really be of much help to you, because you wouldn't know if they worked or not."

"It would still help me a little to cast them on you even with your protections active, but I get your point," I say.

"Barry, I didn't know you were in need of a test subject!" Diane says. "I'd love to help!"

"Are you... sure?" I ask her, a little apprehensively. "I wouldn't want you to force yourself for my sake or anything. You and Kate both grew up in the Beacon of Hope after all..."

"Oh you don't have to worry about me," Diane says. "That trauma is far behind me. The idea of you testing spells on me doesn't bother me in the slightest."

"Well, if you're certain about it, then yeah, I could definitely use your help!" I say. "Thanks!"

"Any time!" Diane says.

"Alright, that's enough chit-chat!" Arraka says, all of a sudden."We've got important business to discuss. Kate, I know you've been practicing aura manipulation in secret for the past two days. Are you ever planning to show us what you've accomplished, or are you just doing it as a hobby?"

 "...I was going to show it to you once I had some more definitive results," Kate says. "At the moment, I'm still not sure if I'm doing it right."

"You were doing fine," Arraka says. "Your only problem is that if you're going to practice interrupting other people's aura manipulation techniques, you're going to need someone actually using such a technique in front of you if you want to make any progress. Daren, you can consistently use your aura to move your sword through the air nowadays, right? Why don't you make your sword float over there, so that Kate can demonstrate to us what she can do?"

"Sure," Daren says, as he does what Arraka asked of him and makes his sword float in the air. "Now what?"

"Kate, will you do the honors?" Arraka says.

"I'll try..." Kate says, as she conjures an icicle in the air, coats it with her aura and then sends it flying somewhere between Daren and his floating sword.

"Whoa..." Daren says, as he sees his sword drop to the ground in front of him. "You did it on the first try! Congrats!"

"See?" Arraka tells us. "She's a natural. And unlike Daren, I didn't even have to teach her anything. She learned it all by herself, while overhearing me give Daren his daily lessons. Now, there's one last thing that I want to test before calling it a day. Kate, why don't you get that brand new scepter of yours and cast a freezing beam on that big rock over there? But I want you to put as much energy into your beam as you can. Max it out, you understand?"

 "I'd rather not use so much magical energy just for a training exercise," Kate says. "What if we get attacked?"

"Your energy recovery rate is faster than anyone in the group," Arraka says. "What are you even complaining about? I bet you can recover that much energy in five minutes, if you just lie down and rest for a little while. Now stop whining and do it. This is important."

"Fine," Kate says, as she picks up her scepter from the ground and points it at the rock. "I'll give it a shot."

"Oh, and one more thing," Arraka says. "Try to shorten the casting time for your spell as much as you can. We wouldn't want to give your enemy too much of an opportunity to react and get away from your line of attack."

"Oh yeah, that rock will never know what hit it!" Hadrik jokes, as he takes another drink of ale.

"I understand," Kate responds, and then she begins gathering an immense amount of energy at the tip of her scepter.

Not even two seconds later, a beam of ice shoots out of the scepter, but the power behind it could only be compared with the flame breath that we saw Tyrath use five thousand years ago when he was still in his prime. Needless to say, the rock never stood a chance against such an attack, but even the air around us has gotten as cold as on a winter day. As we are all looking at Kate, shocked, Arraka begins to laugh very loudly, in three voices at once.

 "Aha-Ahahahahahaha!!!" Arraka laughs. "I knew it! I knew that this scepter wouldn't let me down! Do you know what this is? Do you KNOW what this is?! It's our secret weapon against my copy from the past, that's what! I remember exactly what defenses I used to have back then, and there's no way I could withstand something like this if I were caught unprepared. All you losers need to do is to get that cheap copy of me sufficiently distracted for two seconds, and Kate will freeze her solid! Oh man, I can't believe you idiots lucked out like this! That trip to the lessathi headquarters was worth it in so many ways!"

"So," Illuna asks, "you're saying that your protection spells from five thousand years ago were so weak that you couldn't even protect against a Tyrath-level attack? Because we all saw Tyrath attacking her during the ritual, and she defended against it just fine."

"She didn't 'defend just fine', "Arraka says. "It got her sufficiently distracted for Tyrath to teleport you away from danger, which means that Kate's beam should also keep the other Arraka immobilized just long enough for us to deliver the finishing blow."

 "And how are we supposed to do that?" Kate says.

"With Daren's sword, obviously," Arraka says. "That weapon is so ridiculously enchanted that it can easily pass through pretty much every passive protection spell that exists today, let alone the ones that existed five thousand years ago. Even if she only gets frozen for three seconds, that should still be enough time for this buffoon to cut her in half, as long as he makes sure to stay close enough to her beforehand. The only way to defend against that sword is to either dodge it or use a powerful active protection spell against it, which she obviously won't be able to do because she'll be encased in a block of ice. Wow, this plan gets more perfect the more I think about it!"

 "Will we be able to use the same strategy against the God of Time?"

"Of course not," Arraka says. "The God of Time's body when he manifests on the earthen plane is essentially made of blue light. Have you ever tried freezing light before?"

"No, but I've never seen light taking the shape of a humanoid body before either," I say. "I figured that an ice beam this powerful might have some sort of effect on it."

"Well, you figured wrong," Arraka says. "As I've said before, sharpening the auras around your elements is our best bet against him, along with Daren's sword and maybe Hadrik's aura hardening when he uses it on his fists, although I'm not completely sure about that one. Other than that, some of the spells that I invented could also help, but it will depend on whether you manage to learn them or not."

 "So, I'm guessing that we will only have one chance to make this work?"

"Precisely," Arraka answers me. "It should work properly the first time, because she'd never expect a group of weaklings like you to have such a powerful attack, but once she gets to see it, she'll be on her guard and it will be considerably more difficult to hit her with it. This attack shouldn't be used unless we get a very good opportunity, because otherwise we'd just be wasting it."

 "I was already done talking, you oaf," Arraka says. "Have fun intoxicating yourself with that slow poison you like to call 'dwarven ale'. I'm going back to my research."

"That's what I like to hear!" Hadrik says, as he takes another drink from his bottle.

We spend about half an hour continuing to drink with Hadrik, while trying to talk about anything other than our trainings for a change, and then Diane and I decide to leave early so that she could help me with my spells, like she promised.

As we are trying to find a nice isolated place, away from the others, I get temporarily lost in my thoughts when I remember the eagerness with which Diane agreed to become my test subject for the evening, despite having every reason to not want to do this, just like Kate.

Now that I think about it, this wasn't the first time when Diane acted in this manner. Ever since we left the lessathi headquarters, she's been expending a lot of effort trying to get along with everyone. Perhaps too much effort. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, because it's very clear that she cares deeply about Kate, and it's not an unusual thing to want to get along with her friends, but it's also hard to ignore the fact that she is essentially Meridith's second in command, so she would have every reason to want to get close to us if her orders were to slowly gain our trust and convince us that taking Meridith's offer is a good idea.

 I think Daren and Hadrik might have thought about this too, because I've definitely seen them keeping their distance from Diane, despite her repeated attempts to get into their good graces. I feel a little bad being suspicious about Kate's childhood friend like this, but I suppose it would have also helped if she acted a bit more naturally and didn't try so hard to become our friend. Then again, maybe she's just being awkward and she will start to relax in a few days, once she'll get to know us better. Time will tell. 

"Around here should be fine, I think," Diane says, as she stops somewhere near the river. "We're far enough from the others to not be distracting them from their own trainings. So, what kind of spells will we be testing today, Barry? As you may have guessed, I have a rather high tolerance for pain, so there's no need to hold back!"

 "I'm not sure if I should be relieved or worried that you feel comfortable joking about this," I tell her, as I temporarily turn my back to her to put my backpack on the ground and get my notebook out of it.

All of a sudden, I feel a light slap to the back of my head, coming from Diane.

"When someone jokes about a painful event from their past, it is common courtesy to respond with a joke as well, in order to not make things awkward," Diane tells me. "Now, let's try that one more time!"

"Umm... could you maybe repeat the joke again?" I tell her. "I think my memory might have gotten slightly hazy after that head slap."

Hearing what I had to say, Diane lets out a short snort of laughter before she answers me.

"Okay, that wasn't exactly the retort I was expecting," she says, "but you made me laugh a little, so I'll let you off with a stern warning for now."

"You have my thanks!" I say, as I take a bow.

"So... what spell are you planning to start with, then?" Diane asks me.

 "That's reassuring, because my next spell does have an unusually high mortality rate," I tell her, as I put my backpack on the ground and take my notebook out of it. 

Hearing what I had to say, Diane lets out a short snort of laughter before she answers me.

"Sorry," Diane says. "I wasn't trying to laugh at you or anything, it's just that I wasn't expecting you to actually answer me with a joke of your own. The lessathi I work with tend to just ignore all of my jokes, and Kate would have probably gotten worried for my sake if she heard me joke about my past trauma like that, so I appreciate your attempt at not ruining the mood!"

"You're welcome!" I say.

 "I actually wasn't planning on using any painful spells, but that's good to know," I tell her, as I put my backpack on the ground and take my notebook out of it.

"No painful spells?" Diane asks, surprised. "Not even a little bit? But I thought these were all spells that you're planning to use on your enemies."

"At my current level of magical power, most spells that inflict pain on others would be generally worthless," I say. "That's why for now, my focus needs to be on spells that either disorient my adversaries or affect their senses in some way, because that type of magic usually has some degree of utility no matter how weak the spell is."

"Oh, I see," Diane says. "That does make sense! So... what spell are you planning to start with, then?"

 "I was thinking of beginning with the dizziness spell that I mentioned earlier, during our drinking session," I say. "Would it be okay if I asked you to describe in as much detail as you can exactly what you are feeling in the first few seconds after I cast the spell on you? I'm trying to figure out if I can get any use out of it or not."

"Uh... I have a protection against dizziness cast on me at the moment," Diane says. "Should I remove it first, or--"

"No, no, that's perfect!" I say. "Most enemies will probably have such a protection too, so it's a good idea to do a test under these conditions as well."

"Alright, then," Diane says. "Whenever you're ready!"

As soon as I'm done checking my notebook, I get into my stance and I cast the dizziness spell on Diane. Just as expected, her magical protection easily defends her against my attack, but it did feel like she got slightly distracted for a few seconds right after I finished casting. I wonder if the dizziness spell might have some side-effects that I'm unaware of.

"So, umm... quick question!" Diane says. "Was I supposed to hear a ringing in my ears when you cast the spell on me?"

"I... can't say that I've heard this effect being described for this particular spell before," I say. "But then again, the lesser known a spell is, the more chances there are for its side-effects to not be properly documented, so I'm not all that surprised. What did this ringing sound like? Was it high pitched? Were there short pauses between the ringing noises every half a second or so?"

 "Yes, exactly!" Diane says. "How did you know?"

"I took a wild guess, because the symptoms you described sounded very similar to the ones you get in the first few seconds after someone casts Wolford's daze on you," I say. "I actually noticed that the two spells had a striking amount of similarities in terms of flow, but I didn't think they'd even share some of the effects. This is very interesting. Maybe instead of trying to give people a light headache, I could focus on fooling them into thinking that I'm trying to cast Wolford's spell on them. It feels like that might provide a better distraction."

"So, do you want me to cancel my protection against dizziness now, or?..." Diane asks me.

"I'll just cast the spell on you one more time to make sure that the effects stay the same, and then we'll do the test without the magic protection," I say. "If you don't mind, of course."

"Sure, sure, not a problem," Diane says.

 I continue to test my spells on Diane for about half an hour or so, until I've cast most of my useful targeted spells at least once. The dizziness spell seemed to work fine once Diane removed her protection, and she got a small headache for a few seconds, as expected. Other than that, we also tested a few illusion spells, a suggestion spell and several other spells designed primarily to distract or disorient my enemies.

From beginning to end, Diane has followed my instructions perfectly, without complaints of any kind. She has also kept her same playful and outgoing demeanor this whole time, although sometimes it is hard to know what she is really thinking. Unlike Kate, who will often say exactly what is on her mind, no matter how blunt or disrespectful, Diane is more the type who will try to smooth things over with a joke of some kind. However, she can also be very straightforward, impulsive and even hotheaded, depending on the situation.

If I were to take an educated guess based on what I've seen of her so far compared to how she used to act as a child during the God of Time's ritual, I'd say that the more diplomatic side of her personality is likely a result of Meridith's upbringing, whereas her occasional straightforwardness and impulsive attitude are probably traits that she used to have when she was a kid, but is now trying to suppress, because she considers them to be unwanted flaws of her personality.

 Ironically, if she acted less composed around us, and more like her younger self, I think she would have had a much easier time befriending everyone, because it would have made her seem a lot more honest.

"Alright, I think that was the last of the spells I wanted to test," I say, after a while. "Thanks a lot for the help! I really appreciate it!"

"Done already?" Diane asks. "That's too bad. I was almost starting to get used to the dizziness and feeling of nausea."

"Hey, if you feel like you haven't had enough nausea for one day, you could always ask Hadrik for some ale," I say. "It shouldn't take more than a bottle for you to feel the need to throw up again!"

"Actually... I don't think Hadrik would really want to share his ale with me," Diane tells me, in a more serious tone.

 "Why not?" I say. "Did you have a fight with him or something?"

"No," Diane says, "it's just that every time I try to talk to him, he seems on edge, and it always feels like he's trying to end the conversation as quickly as possible. To be honest, I can't really say that I blame him. I probably would be acting like that too around someone who left me unconscious in the middle of the sacred woods and almost got me killed. I know we've kind of started off on the wrong foot, and I've been trying to smooth things over with him and everyone else as well as I could in the past two days, but to be quite honest, I haven't had much luck. Do you have any idea of a way I could make him warm up to me? Maybe a favorite game, or favorite food, or at least some sort of conversation starter?"

 "Actually," I say, "I think that one of the main reasons why Hadrik is always having his guard up around you might be because you are simply trying too hard to be friends with everyone, and that is making things a little awkward. Maybe you could try... letting things progress more naturally?... There really is no problem if you don't instantly become friends with everyone in the group after only two days of travelling."

"You know what, Barry?" Diane says. "Maybe you're right. Now that you mention it, maybe I have been trying a little too hard to compensate for my bad first impression. I think I'll try to back off a little for the next few days, and leave him some room to breathe. Like you said, it's not a tragedy if I can't suddenly be friends with everyone, right?"

"Exactly," I say. "But hey, if you really need a friend that will always listen to you and help you in your time of need, you could always try Arraka. I'm sure she would love your company!"

"That's the spirit!" I say. "And hey, if things don't work out with Hadrik, you could always try Arraka! One might not be able to tell this at first glance, but she is the type of person who always listens to you and who will help you in your time of need. I'm sure she would love your company!"

"You are very welcome!" I say, as Diane now heads towards Flower and Illuna, presumably to have a conversation with Arraka.

I decide to head in the opposite direction, so that I can test out a few more combinations of spells before beginning my night shift with Daren. As I am walking towards my usual spot, I notice with the corner of my eye that Kate is busy doing her aim training routine, where she aims for separate leaves in the trees with each one of her icicles.

 What catches my attention, however, is that unlike her usual routine, during which she always creates her icicles in different places to further challenge herself, this time she is making the icicles appear in the exact same place over and over, and only changes her targets. Her gaze is also very distant and unfocused compared to how she usually is when she is performing this exercise. It's almost as if she has specifically chosen this easier form of training, so that she can just mechanically go through the motions, while her mind is free to think about something else entirely.

Normally, this wouldn't have been a big deal, but this is the third time in the past two days that I've seen Kate do the exact same thing, despite the fact that she usually takes her aim training very seriously. I think something is up with her. Maybe I should go ask her what's wrong.

 "Hey, there, Kate!" I say, as I get closer to her. "How goes your training?"

"It's going the same as always," Kate tells me, as she shoots a few more icicles at her targets. "Why do you ask?"

"Same as always, huh?..." I say. "So, you're saying that conjuring your icicles in the exact same place over and over was a part of your regular routine, then?"

Just as I finished my sentence, Kate was about to instinctively summon her icicles in the same spot again, but then she waved her hand in the air and made them appear in different places instead.

"I... didn't realize that I was doing that," Kate admits to me. "Since when did you notice this change?"

"Hmm..." I tell her. "I'd say it started maybe yesterday in the afternoon? I've seen you do it in three separate training sessions by now."

"I see," Kate says, simply.

"So, are you going to tell me what's wrong?" I ask her. "I don't think I've ever seen you space out like this during your training, so I'm guessing it has to be something pretty serious. Was it something Diane said?"

"No, it's not that, it's-- nothing that you should concern yourself with," Kate says, apprehensively. "I'll be fine."

 "Okay, let me see if I can get this right on the first guess," I tell her. "Your one main goal since the first day you joined the tournament has always been to find Diane, and to take her with you, away from Varathia. However, now that you've finally had the chance to meet her and talk to her, you've realized that Diane has no intention to leave this place, and that she is working together with the lessathi of her own free will. In other words, the reason why you are conflicted right now is because you've realized that the only way for you to be able to stay with your friend after the tournament is over is to join Meridith and the rest of the lessathi, which isn't exactly the most ideal situation for you. Did I guess correctly so far?"

Kate sighs.

"Only partially," she answers me, after a short pause. "It's not just about what I'm going to do once the tournament is over. I'm also a little worried about Diane. She seems... changed. It's not that I was expecting her to be the exact same person that she was ten years ago, but when I talk to her now, I feel like I can't even tell what she's thinking half the time. I don't know... I suppose I just can't seem to come to terms with the fact that it was so easy to connect with Leila, despite the fact that we barely interacted while we were at the Beacon, but when it comes to Diane, it feels almost like we are strangers sometimes."

 "If it helps," I say, "you should know that you're not the only one having trouble getting close to Diane. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but Hadrik and Daren barely speak to her, and I guess I haven't really had many conversations with her either. There's just something about her that makes her seem a little... insincere, maybe? Not that I'm calling her a liar, or anything, but sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm talking to, uh... to a female version of the king of the underground."

"Barry, that's it!" Kate says loudly, all of a sudden. "I think that's what's been bothering me all this time! Something about her feels similar to the king of the underground, but I'm not sure exactly what. I'll try to see if I can figure it out in the next few days, and maybe that will help me feel a little more comfortable talking to her!"

"So, that's one problem partly solved," I say. "But what about the other one? Have you thought about what you are going to do once the tournament ends, and Diane inevitably tells you that she wants to stay here, in Varathia, and continue to work for Meridith?"

"I'm... not sure yet," Kate says, as she looks to the side. "To be frank, I've been kind of postponing that decision, knowing that we still have some time until we reach Galamir. It's not that I hate Meridith or anything, but I wouldn't exactly want to spend my life working for her either."

 "What if you were to ask Meridith for a special invitation to Varathia, so that you could come back here whenever you wanted?" I say. "Surely, as the leader of the lessathi, she should have enough influence to obtain something like this for you, right? And then you could decide for yourself how much time you want to spend in Varathia, without feeling like you will be trapped here for the rest of your life because of Diane."

"That is... actually not a bad idea," Kate tells me. "I'll try to suggest this to Diane, whenever the subject will come up. Maybe we can work something out."

She pauses for a few brief moments before continuing.

"Thank you..." she tells me, after a while. "This conversation with you ended up helping me more than I thought it would. I know that I can be a little hard to deal with a lot of the time, but I wanted to tell you that I appreciate you sticking by me and remaining my friend despite that fact."

 "Hey, there's no need to sell yourself short," I say. "You also helped me out when I really needed it, remember? You're the one who gave me the idea to try to modify my stat device to extract its energy directly from the magical plane, with the help of the Magium, and it's largely because of your advice that I've been able to keep going, even in the toughest of times. Don't think I'll ever forget that!"

"I'm glad I could help," Kate tells me, with a faint but genuine smile.

"Hey, Barry!" I hear Daren shouting from a distance. "Are you ready for our night shift?"

"Yeah, I'll be right there!" I shout back at him.

"Alright!" Daren says, loudly. "While you're getting ready, I'll go ask Hadrik if he'll loan us his deck of cards. I'll meet you there!"

"Sounds like a plan!" I shout, and then I turn to Kate.

 "Sorry, gotta go!" I tell her.

"No problem," Kate says. "I'll just finish my training and go to sleep. It's getting late."

"Okay, good night, then!" I say. "See you tomorrow!"

"Good night!" Kate says, and then she resumes her training, this time conjuring her icicles correctly.

I leave the area in which Kate was practicing her aiming, and I begin to head towards the place where Daren and I agreed we would be keeping watch from tonight.

 On second thought, it might be better to leave Kate alone for now. She'd probably prefer some peace and quiet, so she can better focus on her own thoughts. I should go practice my spell combinations while I still have time.

I walk past Kate and find a place that is secluded enough for me to be able to practice my magic without being worried about hitting anyone by accident. After several more failed experiments, I realize that this is going to be more difficult than I initially thought, so I decide to just try the simplest possible combination that comes to my mind, and work my way up from there.

 By using my elementalist powers, I am able to combine my fire and water elements in just the right amounts to conjure a cloud of steam big enough to somewhat conceal my presence from my enemies. It might not be the most useful spell ever, but at least it could moderately inconvenience the people who aren't really all that used to locating their adversaries through their auras.

Considering that I only have access to level one spells at the moment, every little bit helps.

 On my way there, I pass by Diane, who was apparently still in a discussion with Arraka, ever since she was done helping me with testing my spells. Now that I think about it, I may have seen her talking with Arraka once or twice before, and for some reason, they seem to actually be getting along quite well. I wonder if there's something I'm missing, here...

"Can I ask you one question?" Diane says to Arraka, as I've now stopped in my tracks to listen to their conversation. "What's it like in the magical plane? I keep hearing you talk about it, but I don't really have any real world examples to compare it to, and it's a bit difficult to fill the gaps just with my imagination."

"Hmm..." Arraka says. "You're an ethereal, right? Well, the magical plane actually feels pretty similar to the ether on the ethereal plane, except instead of an endless plane of light, it's an endless plane of magical energy, if that makes any sense to you. I'm not sure if I can explain it any more clearly than this to someone who hasn't actually experienced it."

"No, no, that is actually a really good explanation!" Diane says. "I'm glad we had this talk. Anyway, it's getting late, so I think I'll be signing off for the night."

"Yes, yes, certainly!" Arraka says, in an uncharacteristically pleasant voice. "Just one last question, if you would be so kind. What color is the sky right now?"

"The sky?" Diane asks, with a smile, as she takes a quick look at the dark sky above us. "Why, it's bright pink, of course! Just like any other day!"

 "My thanks!" Arraka tells her, in the same pleasant voice, as Diane takes a courteous bow, and she goes towards her tent.

"So, uh... I see you're really getting along with Diane, huh?" I ask Arraka, as I now approach Flower and Illuna.

"Oh, yes, the girl is wonderful!" Arraka tells me. "Did you know that I've been asking her the exact same question at the end of every conversation we've had, and she's been giving me the same answer, but the reaction of her aura was different each time?"

"I'm... not sure if I understand what that means," I tell her.

"She's using the same aura concealment technique that the king of the underground was using," Arraka explains to me. "I think she must have learned it from Meridith, because all of the lessathi were using a crude version of this technique, but only Meridith and Diane are proficient enough in it to be on the level of the king of the underground, or maybe even greater than that. Essentially, they are controlling their auras so well that they can almost completely mask whether they are lying or not, and on top of that, they also like to make their auras tremble slightly at random intervals, to make it seem like they are lying even when they are telling the truth."

"Interesting..." I say. "Do you think they're all using this as a precaution, in case they ever get interrogated by Eiden?"

 "Most likely, yes," Arraka says. "It's definitely a unique skill to have, I'll give them that. I wasn't really paying much attention to it before I noticed this with the king of the underground, but now I am gaining more and more of an interest in it."

"So, what were you two talking about before I came by?" I say. "You both seemed to be really enjoying yourselves."

"To be honest, I don't even remember what the main topic of our conversation was, and probably neither does Diane," Arraka says. "We're just playing a game, she and I. A game in which the objective is for me to figure out the way in which her aura concealment works, while she plays around with me and smiles confidently, from a position of clear superiority. It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of being the underdog in any game or competition involving magic, so I'm enjoying this to my fullest."

"Does this mean that you're not getting anywhere close to figuring her out, then?" I ask Arraka.

"Oh, she will slip up eventually, I'm sure," Arraka says. "It's only a matter of time."

"That's an... unusually calm and collected answer, coming from you," I tell Arraka.

"Why wouldn't I be calm about this?" Arraka says. "At the end of the day, it's only a game that I'm occupying my free time with. It matters little to me if I win it or lose it, and it's not like I'm actually interested to know whether she's lying to me or not. I'm just doing it for the challenge."

"I suppose that makes sense," I say. "Alright, well, I guess I'll be off to my night shift, then. Later!"

"Mhm," Arraka says.

"See you later, Barry!" Flower tells me.

I wave goodbye to Flower, and then I go directly to the spot in the woods where Daren and I agreed to meet.

"But what if she doesn't make any mistakes?" I ask her.

"Nobody is perfect," Arraka says. "Diane may be an ethereal, but she is young and overconfident in her abilities. Also, unlike the rest of you, who saw me at my full power both in this world and in the past and thus know what I'm capable of, Diane only knows me as a spirit inside an amulet. She might be aware of who I am in theory, but she's clearly not taking me seriously. At one point she is bound to let her guard down around me, and that is when I will win."

"No, that wouldn't help me in the slightest," Arraka says.

"Why not?" I ask her. "She should have a harder time controlling her aura if she's not completely calm, shouldn't she?"

"The whole point of her aura technique is to make the flow of her aura so erratic that it is impossible to tell whether she is in control of her emotions or not," Arraka says. "At least when she is calm, I know that she is faking it for the most part, so I can try to find a pattern within her aura flows. Making her lose her cool would actually make it harder for me to tell which of the disruptions in her flow are fake and which of them are not."

"Well, you seem to know what you are doing, so I guess I'll leave you to it and be off to my night shift, then," I say. "Later!"

 Once I get there, I see that Daren hasn't arrived yet, so I decide to lie down with my back against a tree and to grab my notebook. I don't really want to experiment with any spell combinations so close to our camp, in case there are any accidents, so maybe I should work on a spell that is a little more harmless.

About twenty minutes later, Daren finally makes his way to our meeting spot and he excuses himself for being late, saying that Hadrik had insisted that he played one short game of Met-Zek with him before giving him the cards.

"So, what have you been doing while waiting for me?" Daren says, as he takes a look at my notebook. "Researching another spell?"

"Yep," I say. "I'm currently trying to figure out what would be the best way to make a mustache stick to the God of Time's face. What do you think? Should I go with an illusion, or a real mustache?"

"Uh... neither?" Daren says. "I thought we had agreed that we wouldn't try to piss off the God of Time for no reason until we'd be strong enough to beat him. Do you really want to get us all killed again?"

"Relax," I say. "If anything, he'll probably just kill me, not the rest of you. And besides, I don't even think the God of Time knows what a mustache is. I'm sure he'll just ignore it and move on."

 "Oh, well if you're sure of it," Daren says, while rolling his eyes.

"So, where are those playing cards?" I ask Daren.

"I've got them right here!" he answers me, as he takes out the deck of cards and puts them on the ground next to me.

For the next few hours or so, Daren and I played a few different card games from both of our homelands, while we exchanged some stories from our time before the tournament. Normally, Daren would have been the one doing most of the storytelling, but this time he insisted on me telling him some of my adventures as well, despite me warning him that any situation I've been in would sound boring compared to what he and Hadrik have experienced throughout their lives.

Once I was done telling him a few of my stories, I couldn't help but notice that I managed to maintain his interest for much longer than I was expecting. He seemed to be paying close attention the whole time I was talking, and sometimes it even felt like he could barely wait any longer to hear the end of the story.

 Once I get there, I see that Daren hasn't arrived yet, so I decide to lie down with my back against a tree and to grab my notebook. I don't really want to experiment with any spell combinations so close to our camp, in case there are any accidents, so maybe I should work on a spell that is a little more harmless.

About twenty minutes later, Daren finally makes his way to our meeting spot and he excuses himself for being late, saying that Hadrik had insisted that he played one short game of Met-Zek with him before giving him the cards.

"So, what have you been doing while waiting for me?" Daren says, as he takes a look at my notebook. "Researching another spell?"

"Yeah," I say. "I've been trying to remember how to cast the frog summoning spell that I talked about earlier today, but I can't quite remember the exact patterns of the flow of magic. I was reading up on my notes, and was thinking of trying it out in the ethereal plane first, to make sure that it works, but I haven't had the time to do it yet."

"So, you've still got a long way to go, then," Daren says.

"Eh... hopefully not that long," I tell him. "Maybe one hour or two at most."

"Alright," Daren says. "Are you ready to play some cards, then?"

"Sure thing," I say, as Daren takes out the deck of cards that he got from Hadrik and puts them on the ground next to me. "Let's see what you've got!"

 For the next few hours or so, Daren and I played a few different card games from both of our homelands, while we exchanged some stories from our time before the tournament. Normally, Daren would have been the one doing most of the storytelling, but this time he insisted on me telling him some of my adventures as well, despite me warning him that any situation I've been in would sound boring compared to what he and Hadrik have experienced throughout their lives.

Once I was done telling him a few of my stories, I couldn't help but notice that I managed to maintain his interest for much longer than I was expecting. He seemed to be paying close attention the whole time I was talking, and sometimes it even felt like he could barely wait any longer to hear the end of the story. Could it be that he actually enjoyed it?

 "Wow, Barry, I guess Leila was right..." Daren says, after I finish telling him about one of my adventures. "You HAVE been holding out on us this whole time. How many more of these wild stories do you still have, anyway?"

"I wouldn't really call any of them 'wild'," I tell him. "Most of the stuff I told you about was just odd jobs that I did here and there so that I could continue to fund my research for becoming a mage. These are not exactly the kinds of things that people would write books about, like any of your achievements for instance."

"Well maybe they should write books about them!" Daren says. "This is some exciting stuff! I'm serious! You really had me by the edge of my seat with some of those stories. I swear, I have no idea if all these people you've met in your life were crazy before they met you or if they slowly turned insane after spending too much time with you, but it's amazing how many likeminded people you've encountered on your path until now. I think the one I'm most surprised of has to be Brinhorn. He always seemed like a man with a good head on his shoulders. How in the gods' names did you manage to rope him into this madness?"

 "Hey," I say, "Brinhorn has spent years upon years winning every single sage tournament from the Western Continent just to get a chance to challenge Azarius for the sage title again and again, without beating him even once. And yet he still does it. Every year! If that's not pure madness, then I don't know what is. But yeah, now that I think about it, maybe Brinhorn and I were pretty likeminded after all. I'm honestly surprised that we haven't run into him so far. I would find it extremely unlikely for him to not be here, especially knowing that Azarius joined this tournament. Maybe he got teleported to the other end of the continent or something."

"Have you not kept in contact with him at all since you left?" Daren asks me. "If you at least had the frequency of his transceiver, we could try to call him."

 "Nah," I say. "It's been years since I last talked to him. I don't even know if he'd still be using the same transceiver or not. I've thought about sending him a letter once or twice, but I always kind of put it off for another time, telling myself that I'd rather give him the good news of having found a way to become a mage rather than contacting him after such a long time just to tell him of my failure. I wonder how he would react if he saw me casting magic now..."

"I'm sure he'd be proud," Daren says. "Maybe he'd even find some more motivation for working harder on his own unachievable goal. If something as impossible as a regular person casting magic can be done, then beating Azarius should seem like a piece of cake in comparison."

"Yeah, I guess you could put it that way!" I say.

"But have you considered it, though?..." Daren asks me, apprehensively.

 "Sure, I guess..." I say. "At least on a theoretical level. Why do you ask?"

"...This is going to sound a little weird, coming from me," Daren says, "but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd feel about killing Eiden, at this point. Especially after he helped me during the God of Time's trial."

Wouldn't it be better for everyone if he spent the rest of his life trying to fix his mistakes, than if he were to just be executed?"

"But is there really a guarantee that he wouldn't give up again?" I say. "Maybe not now, but in a few years from now?"

"Regrets or no regrets, there is still the fact that his actions will cause the destruction of all the Varathian cities," I say. "He admitted it himself. It's only natural that the lessathi and the kings of Varathia would want to defend themselves from him."

Can you imagine how many people he could help with that much power?"

"It doesn't seem like helping people worked out very well for him the first time he tried it," I tell Daren.

"Yes, but if he still has regrets about giving up, maybe it isn't too late," Daren says. "Maybe he could take on the mantle of Creator once again, and do better this time!"

"I think you're forgetting that the kings of pretty much all the cities except for Thilias and Ollendor want Eiden dead," I say. "Which is only natural, considering that Eiden himself admitted to us that his actions will cause the destruction of the cities of Varathia. The kings are in contact with Meridith, who knows about the prophecy from the Magium fragment, so they must know of it as well."

"He might," I say, "but let's also not forget that Eiden admitted himself that his actions would cause the destruction of the Varathian cities. Almost all of the kings are currently plotting to assassinate him, likely for this very reason, so even in the best case scenario, I doubt that any of these cities would welcome him with open arms if he said that he wanted to resume his position as Creator."

 "I can't say that I'm an expert on this myself, but these fragments seem to have certain limitations when interacting with our world," I say. "Thinking back, the only times when a Magium fragment was about to erase me happened either inside the Magium realm, or shortly after the blue crystals awakened. The very first time, we were already inside the Magium realm when we were attacked. This more recent time, we were pulled inside the realm, but only because we were standing close to the node, so it's possible that the node doesn't allow the fragment to interact with our world all that much. Also, if I remember correctly, the Magium fragment that was looking for the Arraka from the past said that it was going to undo this whole universe from its seams just to find out where Arraka was hiding. If it needs to do something so drastic just for finding one person, then it is also a possibility that these fragments are not capable of pinpoint precision attacks outside of their realm, although I might be theorizing a little too much, based on so few facts."

"Yeah, you've definitely lost me, Barry," Daren says. "I know you were trying to make this sound less confusing, but all of this Magium, fragments and node stuff is going way over my head. I can only hope that we will have as little interaction as possible with all of them in the future, so I won't actually need to understand any of this. All I want from the Magium is to use the node to get the knowledge I require from it and that's it. No other complications!"

 "Frankly," I say, "after what we've found out from Meridith, I'm beginning to think that the two old enemies from the prophecy might actually be Eiden and the lessathi, instead of Eiden and Tyrath like we originally thought. I know that he technically 'took their side' during the still winter, according to Melindra, but Meridith clearly does not see things that way, and she is obviously preparing for some kind of big showdown with Eiden at the end of this tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was their fight instead that triggered the destruction of the Varathian cities."

"...I thought that it was the Magium itself that sent this prophecy to us," Daren says. "Why would it send a prophecy about this conflict and at the same time actively take the side of one of the opposing factions and help create the conflict in the first place?"

"According to Arraka, the Magium itself and the Magium fragments are separate entities," I say. "This particular fragment seems to have been using the Magium node inside the lessathi base to communicate with Meridith and make these plans for quite some time, which makes me think that this recent prophecy is not actually its main concern, and its real purpose is to kill Eiden. I wonder if this isn't by any chance the same Magium fragment that gave Eiden the secret knowledge that he needed to defeat Arraka, and now decided that he's been using that knowledge for too long and needs to be removed from the equation."

"This is all really confusing to me," Daren says. "If this Magium 'fragment' really wants Eiden dead, then why doesn't it just erase him? Why does it need us or the lessathi to do the job in its place?"

 "No other complications aside from actually getting access to one of the nodes, you mean..." I say. "The tournament organizers are clearly not planning to let us use one even if we win, so our only choices will be to either take Meridith's deal, or seize control of another node and obtain the tools needed to decipher the knowledge from it. Still, this is a much, much better situation for us than the one we were in a week ago. At least now we know that the prize we were looking for exists, and there is a way to use it. As long as we know it can be used, we'll find some way to access it, with or without Meridith's help."

"I like your spirit!" Daren says. "Yes, I was thinking the same thing. Maybe we should ask Arraka or Illuna if they know the locations of any other Magium nodes. They definitely seemed like they interacted with at least one of them before, so there has to be some way to get to them."

"Absolutely!" I say. "We'll ask them first thing in the morning. And with that said, I think it might be time to go wake up Kate and Diane so they can begin the second night shift. I could use some sleep!"

"Alright, then," Daren says. "Let's gather up these playing cards first, and then we can go."

After we put all of the cards back in the deck, we wake up Kate and Diane, and we go directly to our tents, so we can at least get a few hours of uninterrupted sleep for the night. The next morning, we are awakened by the very distinct smell of roasted wyvern, which should normally be a delicacy served only to royalty, but Flower seems to have no trouble conjuring it in large quantities without expending too much energy. 

 As most of us are slowly being lured towards Flower by the appetizing aroma, we hear Daren having a conversation with his wife, Sophie, on his transceiver while packing his tent. They've been talking at least three times per day since he managed to finally contact her, which is nice to see, since it's clear how much they've missed each other. What's more, Sophie has also blended rather well with our group, and she has already made some plans to join us on a few journeys after we are done with the tournament.

Aside from Daren's wife, we've also been in contact with Melindra and with Leila's father, who both have transceivers from Daren and can call us whenever they like. Unfortunately, since Leila can't send her texts through the transceiver, her father needs to read them out loud for us, which makes our discussions a little awkward, but at least we can communicate with her, so I can't complain. As for Melindra, Flower tends to call her more than ten times a day, so in a way, it's like she never left. I've also seen Kate call her a few times, but she mostly does it in secret, while she is training, probably because she is too embarrassed to let us know that she misses her.

 One other, more unusual conversation partner that we've been talking to on a semi-regular basis since we left the lessathi base is Jirinn, the spirit in the magical plane that Daren is linked with. Well, actually, he mostly only talks with Arraka, and barely acknowledges our presence, but even so, he has been giving us some very interesting information about the latest developments on the magical plane. Apparently, Arraka's plan worked far better than we could have hoped, and now most of the gods have turned against the God of Time, the God of Death and the God of Fate. 

Also, now that the other denizens of the magical plane found out that some of the gods had been absorbing spirits to increase their powers in secret, many of them have started volunteering to join Jirinn's enlightened warriors group and according to him, they should soon have enough members to pose an actual threat to the divided and weakened gods.

However, as Arraka predicted, the three rogue gods have been holding out quite well against all the other gods, and they are giving no signs of losing this battle anytime soon. In fact, from what I understood, nobody has managed to even find the three gods for the past three days, probably because of the God of Fate's illusions that are doing a very good job at keeping them hidden and disorienting their foes. Still, this is very good news for us, because we want the God of Time to be as distracted and weakened as possible when we fight him, if we want to have any realistic chance of success.

 Oh, and I almost forgot about Rose. We've been having pretty much daily discussions with her too, especially during our briefings with Arraka, who is very interested to know about every little advancement concerning Rose's control over her time powers. At the moment, she is capable of stopping time for at most fifteen seconds, and it tires her out rather quickly, but she has mastered the ability to keep time unfrozen for us, even when we are so far away from her, as long as she can focus on the sound of our voices coming from the transceiver. She told us that she also managed to slow down time, but this is an effect that unlike her time stopping powers, seems to affect only a certain area rather than the whole world, so she can't do it for us from a distance.

"Of course I wasn't using it at the time," Arraka says. "I had already gotten most of the information that I needed from the Magium while I was still on the magical plane. The only thing that interested me from the nodes on the earthen plane was to find a way back to my own plane of existence, but I couldn't find anything useful. Things might have gone better if I hadn't been stuck in a mountain or forced to inhabit animal bodies during the majority of my time here, but I never exactly had the opportunity to test that hypothesis."

"But you've both been to this node since Fyron took control of it, right?" Daren asks. "How did you convince him to share it with you?"

 "I haven't really used it that many times in the past twenty years since I first came across it with Flower," Illuna says, "but usually Fyron would ask for a minor favor from us in exchange for a few visits to the node. That is how things normally work with him, as I'm sure Barry has already told you by now. If you want to visit his node while you are here, I'm certain that you can work something out with him when we'll meet him again in Galamir."

"Oh, right," Daren says, "because he'll be there for the diplomatic discussions before the beginning of the war with Tyrath. Hopefully we'll catch him before he leaves."

"Oh, you don't need to worry about that," Diane says. "Those discussions will absolutely not start before everyone gets there, and according to Meridith, I won't be the only one who's late. You will get your chance to talk to him, I'm sure."

"Shouldn't you be the one who is worried?" Illuna asks Diane, while raising an eyebrow. "If they make a deal with Fyron about his node, they will have one less reason to take Meridith's deal about killing Eiden."

 "To be perfectly honest, I don't have any strong feelings about this deal either way," Diane says, while shrugging.

"You know..." Illuna says. "It would be much easier to believe you when you say things like this if you didn't obscure your aura all the time to prevent anyone from knowing if you were lying or not..."

 "Actually, I would never use such a technique even if I had it!"

"Of course not," Hadrik says, jokingly. "You would have no need for it. You already have your bluff stat for that!"

"Exactly!" I say. "And between you and me, I'd say that my bluff stat is definitely superior, when it comes to avoiding lie detection."

"Is that so?" Diane says, with a playful smile. "Then maybe we should have a lying contest one of these days, to truly see which technique is better."

"Any time!" I tell her.

"To be fair, Barry didn't really put any points in his bluff stat yet, as far as I know," Daren says, "so it can be said that he did have access to such a technique and chose not to use it."

"Exactly!" I say. "I could never tell a lie. 'Sincere' is my middle name."

"Your middle name?" Diane asks me. "I thought you only had one name."

"You must have me confused with some of the other thousands of Barrys that you've met before me," I say. "My full name is actually Barry 'Sincere' the Reckless."

 "So... is it okay if I go wash the plates?" Flower asks us, suddenly. "I see that you're all done eating."

"Actually, I think I'll be washing the plates today," Illuna says. "I've been using the knowledge that I retrieved from Meridith's Magium node to improve a spell of mine, and this would be a good way to practice it."

"You used knowledge from the Magium to work on a dish-washing spell?..." Hadrik asks, confused.

"This is hardly the intended purpose of the spell, but sure, you can call it that, if you want," Illuna says, as she makes one of the plates float in the air, inside a sphere of water.

"Hey, wait a minute!" Arraka says. "That's the spell I taught you, isn't it? The one that you used against Tyrath to drown him in Thilias!"

"It's an improved version of your spell," Illuna says. "At this point, it's different enough for me to call it 'my' spell instead."

 "Uh-huh," Arraka says. "Sure it is. Still, it warms my heart that you've finally decided to get over your hatred of me just enough to at least make use of the spells I taught you. It would have been such a waste if you just continued to ignore all of my teachings."

"If you're feeling so talkative, how about actually being useful and giving your input on the modifications I made to your spell," Illuna says. "I've been focusing especially on improving its stability, and on making the water regenerate quickly enough to withstand most of the stronger fire attacks."

"Hmm..." Arraka says. "Not bad. There are a few tiny adjustments that I'd make, but other than that, it doesn't look bad at all. Here, let me mark some of the inadequacies I've noticed, so that you can work on them."

 "You're not drinking any ale today, Hadrik?" Daren says, as Illuna is busy following Arraka's indications while washing the dishes. "That's certainly unusual!"

"Ugh..." Hadrik says. "Don't remind me. I've been having a headache all morning because of the hangover."

"But why today of all days?" Daren asks. "Is there some special occasion?"

"Yeah," Hadrik says. "The special occasion of Barry having tested a dizziness spell on me yesterday. I don't know if it's an allergic reaction or something, but there are certain dizziness spells that can cause me to become nauseous at the mere smell of any type of alcohol. The effects usually tend to truly set in the next day after the spell has been cast on me, and they normally last until late in the evening."

"Oh, damn..." I say. "Sorry about that. I would have chosen a different type of spell if I had known that this was such a problem for you."

"It's fine," Hadrik says. "I never really bothered telling anyone about this, so there would have been no way for you to know. Anyway, Daren, since I can't drink today, would you mind having a short sparring session with me so I can at least unload some of my frustration? We'll try to end it when Illuna is done practicing her spell with Arraka."

 "Sure thing," Daren says. "Let's go over there, and we can start right away."

As soon as Daren and Hadrik move away from the rest of us and get into their positions, they both count to three at the same time and then they dash at each other almost immediately. However, not even thirty seconds after the start of the battle, Daren calls for an unexpected time-out.

"Stop, stop, stop!" Daren shouts all of a sudden. "Hadrik, what in the gods' names are you doing?"

"What do you mean what am I doing?..." Hadrik says. "I'm fighting. You've seen me fight dozens of times before."

"Not like this!" Daren says. "Your moves are not the same at all! It's like you've become a completely different person overnight! How in the world could you have changed your fighting style so much over the course of one day? I couldn't even predict half of those moves and I was reading your aura every step of the way!"

"Oh yeah," Hadrik says. "Now that I think about it, people HAVE told me in the past that I fight a little better when I'm not drunk. I suppose it's been so long since I've been sober that I simply forgot."

 "Hadrik, my friend..." Daren says. "This fighting style of yours isn't just a little better, it's a huge improvement! I could barely wrap my head around it, and I've seen you fight countless times. If you already know that you can fight so much better without drinking, then why not just take a break from alcohol until the tournament is over? Don't you want to be at your strongest when fighting your opponents?"

"Hmm..." Hadrik says. "How am I going to explain this to you in a way that makes sense?... You see, to me, drinking alcohol is like breathing air. If someone were to come to you now and tell you that you could fight ten times better if you stopped breathing, would you do it?"

"I suppose I should have known that you'd say something like this," Daren says. "Never mind. Forget that I even asked. Illuna are you done with those dishes yet?"

"Almost," Illuna says. "These two are the last ones."

 Realizing that Illuna and Arraka are probably going to be busy for a while longer, the rest of us go to pack our tents and get ready to resume our journey. By the time we are done, Illuna has also finished washing the plates, so we put them all in Hadrik's backpack and then go on our way, heading in the direction of the nearest sacred forest.

According to Diane, if we keep up our usual pace, we should get there at some point in the afternoon. We still haven't decided exactly what we are planning to do if the fox happens to catch us on her territory again while we're looking for pinecones, but I suppose when we have so many strong enemies already, adding one more to the list shouldn't make much of a difference.

On our way to our destination, I noticed that Diane was being a lot less insistent on trying to be friends with everyone. As a result, she would act more naturally, which in turn also allowed Hadrik and Daren to be a little more relaxed in their conversations with her. It's nice to see that my advice is working out for her. Maybe it was a good idea to talk to her about this after all.

"Oh gods!" Flower exclaims, not even an hour after our departure, as she points excitedly at some very mundane-looking rock. "Barry, do you see that? It's a cloakshield rock! A cloakshield rock, Barry!"

On our way to our destination, I noticed that Diane was trying even harder than usual to be friends with everyone, probably because she was feeling bad about the whole situation with her obscuring her aura, and wanted to compensate for it. However, as expected, this only increased the suspicions of Daren and Hadrik, making most of their conversations appear very forced and unnatural. Unfortunately for her, things will likely not improve much between her and the others as long as she doesn't realize that she is sabotaging herself by acting overly-friendly like this.

 Once Illuna is done with the plates, we put them all in Hadrik's backpack, then go to finish dismantling our tents. We leave ten minutes later, heading in the direction of the nearest sacred forest.

 "I see it," I say, in a very unenthusiastic tone.

"That rock... looks nothing like a cloak or a shield..." Daren says. "Why would you call it that?"

After hearing what Daren had to say, Flower shakes her head in disapproval and looks at him as if he were some simpleton that had no taste for the fine arts.

"You wouldn't understand..." she says, and then she goes to grab the stone from the ground.

"Oh, for crying out loud!" Arraka says, all of a sudden. "Not another one of these!"

"Yeah, there are a lot of rocks here on the earthen plane," Hadrik says. "Better get used to it."

"Not the rock, you moron!" Arraka says. "It's one of Eiden's invisible spells that he's been casting all over the continent. The girl just ran right into it with my amulet hanging around her neck, and I always get a tingling sensation whenever she does that. It's extremely annoying."

"You said 'not another one of these'..." Daren tells her. "How many of these spells have you been detecting, lately?"

"In the past two days?" Arraka asks. "Five of them. And that's only the ones that Flower happened to run into. There may have been more, but I didn't really bother to actively look for them. Apparently, Eiden's been very busy lately."

"Do you have any idea what he's using these spells for?" I say.

 "Nope," Arraka says. "If I absolutely wanted to, I could probably figure it out, but you'd need to stand in place and let me analyze one of these for at least a day, or maybe more. Trust me, it would be a waste of time for all of us."

"Too bad," Daren says. "If you could have done it in only a few hours it might have been worth it. If Eiden's been placing so many of them around the continent, then these spells must be very important to him."

"Here's an idea," Arraka says. "How's about you don't try to antagonize Eiden too, while we're already busy making plans to kill the gods and the copy version of me from the past. Let's take things one at a time, shall we?"

"Fine, fine," Daren says. "But for the record, I wasn't trying to antagonize him or anything. I was just thinking that maybe if we found out what he was after, we could better understand his motivations, and maybe that could help us find some common ground with him."

"Sure you were," Arraka says, in a sarcastic tone. "Alright, move along, folks! Nothing to see here."

As soon as we leave the area, Flower pulls out her transceiver, and she shouts into it loudly.

"Hey, Melindra!" she says. "You'll never guess what rock I found lying in the grass in the middle of the woods!"
