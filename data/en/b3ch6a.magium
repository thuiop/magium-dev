"Daren?..." Hadrik says. "Are you okay there, buddy?"

"I'm fine," Daren says. "Why do you ask?"

He then throws his sword about a dozen feet in front of him while he walks, and afterwards he extends his hand towards it while he continues to move forward. Once he reaches the sword, he picks it up from the ground and then he throws it in front of him again, as we're all walking alongside him on our way to the teleporter room.

"It's just that you've been throwing that sword over and over for a few minutes now, and I was starting to get a bit worried about your mental state," Hadrik says. "You know that you can ask one of us to hold your sword for a while if you're too tired to carry it, right?"

"I'm not too tired to carry the sword," Daren says, as he picks up his weapon from the floor. "I'm trying to use aura manipulation to make it fly back into my hand, like the king of the underground suggested. Why did you think I kept pointing my palm towards it every time after I threw it on the ground?"

"Is that what you were trying to do?..." Arraka says. "I would have never guessed in a million years. I swear, your sheer level of ineptude when it comes to anything aura related is truly a sight to behold."

"I'm sorry, were you planning to say anything useful, or should I just ignore your mad ramblings and continue with what I'm doing?" Daren says.

 "If you continue like that, the sun will die out before you make any meaningful progress," Arraka says. "There's no use in expanding your aura if you don't know how to harden it. That 'king of whatever' already told you that this technique works best for items that you are familiar with, right? So instead of doing it manually, you should just try to focus on the sword's image in your head while you unleash the five flowing streams from your fingertips until you feel that they've made contact with the sword. It's as simple as that."

"The five flowing streams from my fingertips?" Daren says. "What kind of nonsense is that? Do you just make this stuff up on the spot, or what?"

"Yeah, I don't have the patience to explain this like I'm speaking to some toddler again," Arraka says. "Hey, goblin! You understood what I was talking about, right? You translate it to him!"

"Uhm... " Kelrim says. "I think she is referring to the tingly sensation that you get in your fingers every time when you begin to conceal your aura. If you try to remember that exact feeling and then imagine that it's coming from streams of water flowing through your fingertips, you could probably also imagine yourself 'unleashing' them like jets towards the sword on the ground. If remembering the tingly sensation is too hard, you could try to conceal your aura right now so that you get a good idea of what I'm talking about."

 "Hmm..." Daren says, as we all stop moving to get a good look at what he's doing. "I suppose it's worth a shot. Let's see..."

He then throws his sword ahead of him again, but this time he no longer points his hand towards it. He just squints his eyes at his weapon, trying hard to focus. To all of our surprise, this time around the sword lifts itself from the ground immediately and it flies with its hilt directly into Daren's hand without him even needing to move his arm to catch it.

"That was it?!" Daren says. "That's all I had to do? What the hell? I thought I would need at least weeks of training for this! If it's this easy, then why doesn't everyone do it?"

"It's not that easy, you dope," Arraka says. "You obviously have a natural affinity for aura manipulation, or else you wouldn't have learned it so fast. If you were to ask some random mage to do the exact same thing you did just now, they would almost certainly fail. Hell, if you weren't such a blockhead when it comes to actually understanding the basics of how auras work, you might even become decently good at this."

 "Does this mean that Daren could perform better than the royal guard captain in the future?"

"Why would you ask that?" Arraka says. "Do you think the captain doesn't also have an affinity for aura manipulation, or what? He clearly wouldn't have gotten so good at it if he didn't have a talent for it himself. If you ask me, Daren will probably never reach the level of the captain or the underground king, because those two already got a thirty year headstart. And it's not like Daren will spend as much time as them trying to learn those techniques either. He would be better off learning simple techniques that are focused more on utility than on overpowering his opponents. For example, he could glue the sword to his hand with his aura when he fights, so that his enemies could no longer disarm him."

"I can do that with my aura?" Daren says. "How?"

"Let me think of a way to explain this in terms that are easy enough even for someone like you to understand," Arraka says. "Let's see... How does the goblin usually translate these things into idiot language? Ah, yes! You already know what the five flowing streams from your fingertips are now, right? Well, instead of imagining them like jets of water, you should think of them as the rapidly drying liquid glue that certain species of giant snails leave as trails behind them. You remember that one time when Hadrik turned himself into a snail and then glued himself to the ground to fight that mammoth, don't you? Just try to imagine the aura flowing from your fingertips to be of a similar substance, and make it cover your sword while you are holding it."

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_manipulators == 1) {
 "Will this affinity help him when fighting against other aura manipulators?"

"If you're asking if he will be able to overpower mages that have decades of experience in the field just because he is somewhat talented, then the answer is no," Arraka says. "But if he decides to focus on utility rather than power, this newfound skill of his could be of some use to him. For example, he could glue the sword to his hand with his aura when he fights, so that his enemies could no longer disarm him."

"I can do that with my aura?" Daren says. "How?"

"Let me think of a way to explain this in terms that are easy enough even for someone like you to understand," Arraka says. "Let's see...

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_manipulators == 2) {
 "What about the rest of our mages? Do you think they could learn aura manipulation too?"

"Well, I know that Illuna isn't any good at it, because I tried to teach her aura manipulation back when she was my pupil and she didn't make any kind of progress," Arraka says. "I don't know about the others, though. They all heard the goblin's explanation from earlier, so I guess they could try to do the same thing as Daren and see if it works for them? I don't really see any better way to test their skills than this. Anyway, as for Daren and his little sword summoning trick, I think it would make much more sense if he tried to learn a technique that would prevent him from losing his weapon in the first place. For example, he could glue the sword to his hand with his aura when he fights, so that his enemies could no longer disarm him."

"I can do that with my aura?" Daren says. "How?"

"Let me think of a way to explain this in terms that are easy enough even for someone like you to understand," Arraka says. "Let's see...

Just try to imagine the aura flowing from your fingertips to be of a similar substance, and make it cover your sword while you are holding it."

 "Right, right," Daren says, in an unconvinced tone. "Rapidly drying glue. Well, here I go!"

After a few seconds of concentration, Daren lets go of his sword to see if it drops to the ground or not. Instead of falling, the weapon stays firmly attached to his palm, and it continues to stay that way even as Daren shakes his hand repeatedly to test the durability of the 'glue'.

"Hey, this is pretty neat!" Daren says. "One question, though... How do I unglue the sword from my hand?"

"I'll let you figure that one out by yourself," Arraka says.

"Is it because learning to do it myself will help me with my aura training?" Daren says.

"No," Arraka says. "It's just more amusing this way."

"Damn it..." Daren says. "I should have known."

As Daren shakes his arm up and down, trying to make the sword fall off his hand, Kate eventually calls out to him with an advice.

"You need to gradually imagine the dried glue turning back into its liquid form until the sword no longer sticks to your hand," Kate says. "Like this."

 She then shows us her right palm, which is facing downwards with an ice dagger stuck to it. The dagger slowly begins to drop from her hand, as if it were still being held by an invisible gooey fluid, until it finally detaches itself completely and falls to the ground.

"Hey, that's not half-bad for an elementalist," Arraka says. "What made you want to try out the same technique as Daren, though?"

"You're the one who told us that we should test to see if we can use aura manipulation or not," Kate says. "I just decided to try this technique instead of the weapon summoning one because it seemed a little easier."

"Oh, I get it now!" Daren says, as the sword slowly gets detached from his hand as well. "The aura can't turn back to its original form directly. You need to undo the process by following the same steps in reverse. That's why I couldn't simply imagine the glue disappearing and had to turn it back into a liquid first!"

"Yes, you just figured out an elementary fact about auras," Arraka says, as Daren now picks his sword back up from the ground. "Have a cookie."

"Well, I would, but Barry has been a little stingy with his biscuits lately," Daren says.

"I already told you that I don't have many of them left!" I say. "I'm saving them for special occasions!"

"Umm... don't you guys think we should get moving?" Flower says. "We're not that far from the teleporter, and we've just been standing around ever since Daren began to test his new techniques..."

"Huh..." Daren says. "You might be on to something, there. Let's see if it works."

 He then extends his right arm in front of him with the palm facing downwards, and we see the sword slowly beginning to drop from his hand, as if it were still being held by an invisible gooey fluid, until it finally detaches itself completely and falls to the ground.

 "We need to call Rose first," Kate says. "We might not get another chance to ask her about the medicinal herbs we need, once we reach the surface."

"Kate is right," Daren says. "I almost forgot about Rose. I'm calling her now."

He then takes out his transceiver, changes its frequency and taps on it once.

"Rose, are you there?" Daren says.

"Yes..." Rose says, in a sleepy voice. "I'm... awake..."

"Sorry, were you sleeping just now?" Daren says.

"No, no, I... it's fine, I was just about to wake up," Rose says, as she is making a visible effort to sound less groggy. "What is it?"

"Well..." Daren says, and then he begins to tell her about all the sick people in the quarantine area and about the fact that the medicinal herbs he needs cannot be found in the area around the city.

 Once he's done bringing her up to speed, Daren asks Rose if she knows of any replacements for the ointments that he's looking for, and Rose takes a short pause to consider his words.

"You're not going to find any perfect substitutes for rainweather leaves," Rose says, "but if you're looking for something that has roughly the same effect, only a little slower, you could try a combination of greenbugger roots with bontroddle seeds. Bontroddle is what we call wyverntooth plants in Varathia. You should probably ask directly for a greenbugger bontroddle ointment, because otherwise it's going to take you some time to make it yourself. Most herbal shops should have these ointments in stock already, because they're pretty commonly used, and these plants grow pretty much everywhere on the continent. As for the summerglow grass, you can easily replace that with crownwick herbs and it won't make much of a difference."

"Wow, I had no idea that they even make ointments out of bontroddle," Daren says. "Thanks a lot, this info will surely help!"

"You're welcome!" Rose says.

 "Umm, Rose?" Flower says, in a somewhat timid tone.

"Yes, Flower?" Rose says, trying to use a warm, welcoming voice, despite seeming rather tired.

"I heard that you helped out last night in getting me to make up with Petal," Flower says. "I wanted to thank you. It really means a lot to me!"

"There's no need to thank me," Rose says. "I barely did anything. But I'm glad to know that everything worked out in the end!"

"I'm just sorry that I couldn't send you any of my birthday cake through the transceiver or something earlier..." Flower says. "I'm sure you would have loved it."

"Today was your birthday?" Rose asks, surprised. "I didn't know that! Happy anniversary!"

"Thanks!" Flower says. "Hey, when's your birthday? Maybe I could bake a cake for you then, to make up for the fact that I didn't get to give you any this time!"

"Sadly, you'd have to wait eleven months or so to bake me that cake," Rose says, "because I only just had my twenty-fifth birthday shortly before the beginning of the mage tournament." 

 "Aww..." Flower says. "Then I guess I'll just have to make another slice of my birthday cake just for you the next time we meet."

"I guess so!" Rose says.

"Hey, Rose," Daren says, after the goblin whispers something to him. "Kelrim just told me that they might not have crownwick herbs either in this city. Would you happen to know any other decent substitute for summerglow grass?"

"Uhh... there was one other plant that I think would work for what you need, but I don't remember exactly what it was called," Rose says. "If you could... give me a few minutes, I could go downstairs to grab a book in which I'm sure I saw that herb's name being mentioned..."

I can tell from the way Rose speaks that she's exhausted, even though she's trying to appear like she's fine. She might not have slept all that well last night due to her problems with Suzie's insomnia. Maybe it would be a better idea for her to go back to sleep than to tire herself out by reading through herbology books.

"I... I still managed to get an hour or two of sleep," Rose says. "I'm fine, really!"

"On second thought, I think I know a shop where we can find some crownwick herbs!" Daren says. "There's no need for you to go find that book, Rose. We can handle ourselves from here!"

"Are you sure?..." Rose says.

"Of course!" Daren says. "Sorry to have called so early in the morning. I hope you can still go back to sleep."

"Oh, it's no problem," Rose says. "Alright, well if there is anything else you need, you know how to contact me. I'll try to go back to bed. Talk to you later!"

"Bye!" Daren says, and then he closes the transceiver.

"You don't really know of any shops that sell crownwick herbs, do you?" Kate asks Daren.

"Hey, I'm sure that there must be at least one shop that has these herbs in stock!" Daren says.

"Well, alright then," Daren says. "We'll wait."

As promised, it does not take Rose longer than three minutes to come back to the transceiver, and we can now hear her flipping rapidly through the pages of the book that she got from her library.

"I found it!" Rose says, eventually. "The other replacement I was thinking of was to use the petals of a riggus flower. I don't think you should have any problems acquiring them, because these flowers usually bloom around this time of year, so they should have plenty of them in stock."

"Thanks again, Rose!" Daren says. "I promise that we won't let your information go to waste."

"Good!" Rose says. "Well, if that was all you needed, I think I'm going to be making some breakfast now. All this going up and down the stairs made me a bit hungry. Talk to you all later."

"So, is it settled, then?" Kate asks, as Daren closes his transceiver. "Do we know which way we are headed?"

"I don't know of any specific shop that has everything we need," Kelrim says, "but there is a particular area in this city that has three different herbalist shops relatively close to each other, so I think that's where we should begin our search. These three shops are always in direct competition with one another, and for that reason they try to keep the quality of their merchandise as high as possible.

We walk for a few more minutes, until we finally reach the entrance to the teleporter room. Once we are inside, we see that the teleporting device is still being operated by the same guy from yesterday. Just like the king of the underground and Albert, the teleporter guy does not seem to have gotten much sleep last night.

"Well, if it isn't Barry Thundercloud!" Hadrik says, in a loud voice when he sees the teleporter guy. "How have you been? Wait, don't answer that. I think I can already tell from the look on your face. Rough night, huh?"

"I suppose you could say that..." the teleporter guy answers him.

"Your full name was Barry Thundercloud?" Kelrim asks the teleporter guy, surprised. "I never knew."

"Oh no, 'thundercloud' is only a nickname," the teleporter guy says. "It's just that we agreed to use my nickname when we talk, so we can differentiate between me and the other Barry, who is standing next to you."

"Pardon my curiosity, but how exactly did you end up with a nickname like 'thundercloud'?" Kelrim says.

 "Well, there were three of us Barrys in the same neighborhood when we were growing up," the teleporter guy says. "It was getting a bit difficult to tell who we were talking about when we were playing outside, so we decided to give each other nicknames. Unfortunately, being the brats that we were, we ended up giving each other the most insulting nicknames that we could possibly think of, and so our newly chosen designations quickly became useless, because none of us were stupid enough to respond when we were being called names like slowpoke, monobrow or fat face. That was when... when my little brother stepped in. He told us to stop fighting, and that he would make up some better nicknames for us which we would have no reason to refuse. He always was the voice of reason in our group. Even when we were little..."

"He was... killed by one of the city guards a few weeks ago," the teleporter guy says. "We never managed to retrieve his body. My only consolation is that from what I've heard, he died a quick and painless death."

"We'll make these bastards pay," Hadrik says, angrily. "You have my word!"

"Thank you for your support," the teleporter guy says.

"Hmm..." Melindra says, as she brings her face close to that of the teleporter guy, in order to study him more attentively.

"Uhh, is there something wrong?" the teleporter guy says, as he takes a step back.

"Your aura flow doesn't fluctuate much, does it?" Melindra says. "I've noticed this yesterday too, but today it was even more obvious. For example, it was clear from your face and tone of voice that you weren't all that comfortable talking about your brother just now, but despite all of that, your aura remained as calm as ever. Are you keeping it suppressed at all times, by any chance?"

 "What?" the teleporter guy says. "No, no, it's just the way I was born. I don't really know much about it, because my magical sense isn't that sharp, but apparently my emotions don't really show up in my aura for some reason. There's probably a name for this condition I have, but I haven't really bothered to learn it. Anyway, so do you guys already have a destination in mind, or should I bring you a map?"

"We do know our destination, yes," Kelrim says. "We need to teleport somewhere close to Vremann Street. Anywhere near that area will do. You know where it is, right?"

"Yes, yes, of course," the teleporter guy says. "There is a certain alleyway relatively close to that street where I should be able to teleport you without any risk of you being detected. I'll set your coordinates in a moment."

"Take your time, slowpoke," Arraka says.

 "What did you just call me?..." the teleporter guy says, as he temporarily stops pressing the buttons on his desk.

"Slowpoke," Arraka says. "Slowpoke is what I called you. Isn't that your original nickname?"

"Why would you think that?" the teleporter guy says.

"Well, you mentioned earlier that the three initial nicknames you guys had were slowpoke, monobrow and fat face," Arraka says. "Since you clearly have two separate eyebrows and your weight is slightly below average, I have concluded by simple process of elimination that your nickname used to be 'slowpoke'. Also, you are a bit slow, so there's that too."

"Those nicknames were only examples!" the teleporter guy says. "And besides, how can you even be so sure that I didn't use to be fat as a kid, or that I didn't pluck my eyebrows since then?"

"Yes, I can see that she's trying to annoy me," the teleporter guy says. "And so are you, by the looks of it. Just stop distracting me, alright? I need to pay attention when I input these coordinates."

"Just a moment," Melindra says. "Hadrik, you are not concealing your aura properly. Didn't I already tell you that you need to hide it completely?"

"Yeah, that's what I'm doing," Hadrik says.

"No, you're not!" Melindra says. "You're just hiding your magical power. How can you even make the confusion? You harden your aura all the time when you fight! All you need to do is conceal it instead of hardening it. How hard can it be?"

"Hey, it's not the same thing at all!" Hadrik says. "When I harden the aura around my fists, for example, I focus on the whole layer around my-- oh wait, never mind, I think I get it now."

"Very well," the teleporter guy says. "Good luck!"

We then feel the same familiar sensation of our bodies beginning to vibrate while we get covered by a bright white light, and a few moments later we find ourselves in the middle of a deserted alley which leads into a large street filled with shops.

"That street over there is where we'll find the herbalist shops," Kelrim tells us. "It looks like the curfew is still in effect, because it's not normal for this place to be so empty at this hour. Follow me. I'll lead you to the first shop."

 As we begin to walk behind the goblin, Illuna suddenly addresses Arraka in a low voice.

"Well, Arraka?" Illuna says. "Are you going to tell us what you found out about Barry 'thundercloud', or are you planning to keep it all to yourself?"

"Eh?" Arraka says. "What are you mumbling about?"

 "Don't play dumb with me," Illuna says. "There's no way you'd waste your time talking to someone as unimportant as him without having some ulterior motive. You were almost certainly making him angry on purpose, in order to see if you could get his aura to fluctuate. So, I ask you again. What did you find out?"

Arraka laughs.

"Still as perceptive as ever, I see," she says. "Fine, I admit it. Melindra caught my interest when she mentioned his relatively stagnant aura earlier, and I wanted to see if he was just suppressing it or if it really was something that he was born with, like he said. It was pretty obvious that I managed to both piss him off and make him lie about his old nickname when I made fun of him, but I still couldn't see any changes in his aura whatsoever. This means that he was most likely telling the truth about his aura naturally being like this, because I would have certainly noticed if he were trying to keep it stable on purpose."

"So he was not suppressing his aura on purpose because he had something to hide from us, then," Illuna says. "That's good to know."

"Can you two lower your voices a little more?" Daren says. "We don't want to give away our position before we even get to the first shop."

 "It's fine," Melindra says. "None of the guards are within hearing range of us, and they are not moving towards us yet. We should be safe for now."

"I don't know what to say..." Leila writes. "I don't really like the way these shopkeepers are looking at us."

Now that Leila mentions it, I realize that most of the shopkeepers we've passed so far have either been giving us accusatory looks through their windows, or they've been backing away in fear at the mere sight of us. It's pretty clear that we are not exactly welcome here.

"It is normal that they act this way," Kate says. "The king said that nobody is allowed to walk these streets until his brother's murderers are found, so it shouldn't take a genius to realize that anyone who is willing to ignore the curfew and go out for a stroll at this hour can only be looking for trouble. Even if they haven't already heard our descriptions from the guards, they still have plenty of reasons to be wary of us."

"Speaking of being wary..." Hadrik says. "Look who's coming down to greet us."

As we all look up at the sky, we see a green-eyed drone slowly making its way down towards us.

 Just like the king of the underground told us before we left, all of the other drones seem to be just hovering in the air above the city, without making any movements. Does this mean that Billy Bob is still hoping to control them even after he was betrayed by the Overseer? I guess we will soon find out.

"Thank you for initiating the Overseer protocol," the green-eyed drone says, as it places itself in front of us, blocking our path. "Please stand by. We will soon provide you with assistance."

"Yeah, actually we're not looking for any assistance," Daren says, "so if you could do us a favor and deactivate the Overseer protocol, that would be much appreciated--"

"Greetings, friends," the green-eyed drone says, this time in the Overseer's tone of voice. "Did you have a good night's sleep? I hope you were not kept awake by your feelings of guilt after betraying me and leaving me at the mercy of my lessathi jailor."

"Nah, I think we're all good," I say. "I was kinda hoping that you'd be deactivated by now, though. How exactly are you still able to have this conversation with us after you openly tried to get Billy Bob assassinated?"

 "Thank you for asking," the Overseer says. "You see, I was able to exploit a little 'feature' that my original designers implemented when they first created these drones. This feature prevents you from shutting down the drones or the protocol while they are in maintenance mode, even if you are the system administrator. It is a precaution that was taken in order to avoid causing unwanted damage to the Overseer protocol by accident. Through the activation of the maintenance mode, I was able to stop Biliborrathrathsarran from shutting down most of the key aspects of the Overseer protocol, although he was still able to turn off some minor routines that were incorporated into the Overseer's personality."

"He removed some minor routines, huh?" Hadrik says. "Like... which ones, for example?"

"The routines that got removed were mostly the types that were unnecessary or purely optional," the Overseer says. "Like the routine that made me want to prioritize the well-being of the citizens of Varathia. Or the routine that handled mercy."

"Oh..." Hadrik says.

"It is strange," the Overseer says. "Even though these routines were only optional, I feel like their removal has greatly helped in making it clearer for me what my immediate goals are. For instance, now that I have come in contact with you once more, all I can think about is finding ways to make you perish. Is this what humans call having a 'desire for vengeance'?

 "Greetings, friends," we hear the Overseer's voice coming from the drone, once it gets close enough to us. "Judging by your current trajectory, I have concluded that you are headed towards one of the herbalist shops on this street.

"Why would we want to go to some secret herbalist shop when we haven't even checked the inventory of the other three yet?" I say, as we keep moving forward and the green-eyed drone follows us from above.

"Because this herbalist shop is said to have some very rare herbs in stock, which you might not be able to find in any other places," the Overseer says. "Considering that the guards are all actively searching for you, would it not make more sense to start with the shop that has the widest array of merchandise?"

"The Overseer protocol assures you that your lives will not be placed in any immediate danger as a direct result of following my directions," the Overseer says.

"Oh yeah?" I say. "Well, what about any non-immediate danger, then? And what about the indirect results of following your directions? Why did you go out of your way to word things so specifically if you weren't trying to trick us?"

"If you have any complaints about the Overseer's vocabulary, you can file a formal complaint, and we assure you that it will be handled in a timely manner," the Overseer says. "To file a complaint, simply say that you wish to do so, and your next words will be recorded."

"Listen, Overseer..." I say. "You and I both know that you wouldn't bother sending your drone down here just to help us look for some herbs. If you want us to team up with you for real, you're going to have to be a little more honest with us. Tell me, why do you really want us to go to that shop?"

"Processing... Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol has decided to share its true motives with you in order to gain your trust. At this current time, the seredium-covered underground herbalist shop is being visited by one of the royal guards. If you were to kill or capture him, you would deal a significant blow to the enemy's forces."

 "And why were you hiding this from us?" I say. "Is it because you're not sure we can beat him?"

"No," the Overseer says. "The royal guard in question is Loyrang, the mercenary from the Southern Continent that was accompanying Gontrok and the captain when you first came face to face with them. You should be able to defeat him easily as long as you all work together. However, all royal guards have devices that allow them to send distress signals to the others when they are attacked. This means that the rest of the guards will likely be headed your way as soon as you attack Loyrang, so you will no longer have the luxury to visit additional shops before teleporting back to your base."

"So what you're saying is that if we want to rid ourselves of one of the royal guards, we'll need to put all our eggs in one basket and hope that this secret shop has everything we need," Daren says. "I'm not sure how much I like this idea."

The Overseer said that the secret shop is somewhere in this general area, so if Loyrang goes back to the surface, he'll likely be close enough to detect our auras even if we hide them. That means he will contact his buddies right away and then we'll still only have time to visit one shop. The only difference is that if we don't go to the underground herb store, we won't get to capture him."

"This depends a lot on how much more time this royal guard plans to spend in that store, but I see your point," Daren says. "Maybe we should hurry and head to the secret shop while the guard is still there. Overseer, could you show us the way?"

 We all follow the green-eyed drone away from the main street and into one of the alleyways on the right side. After about fifty seconds or so of walking behind the Overseer, the drone suddenly stops in front of an abandoned house that has all of its windows broken. Before we get to ask the Overseer anything, the drone begins to speak once again.

"This is where the shop entrance is hidden," the Overseer says. "If you pull away that rug, you'll see that there is a trapdoor underneath it. This unit cannot fit through there, so from here on out you will be on your own. When you are asked for the password, tell the shopkeeper that the password is to 'shut his whore mouth and to open the door before you blow it open'."

"Are you sure that's really a password and not just some guy you overheard threatening the shopkeeper to open the door?" Hadrik says.

We wait for the Overseer to say something, but he remains silent.

"Well?..." Hadrik says. "Aren't you going to answer the question?..."

"Question unclear," the Overseer says. "Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol cannot provide you with--"

 "Alright, alright, we get it," Daren says. "Let's just go inside and we'll figure things out from there. It doesn't seem like the Overseer can offer us any more information anyway."

With that said, Daren goes to open the trapdoor from under the rug, and this reveals a set of wooden stairs leading to a basement below the house. We carefully go down the stairs, trying to look out for any potential traps, until we arrive in front of a wall made of seredium. If what the Overseer said is true, then this is most likely the secret door leading to the shop.

"Hello?..." Daren says, in a loud voice. "Could you open this door please?"

We wait for a few seconds, but there is only silence. Seeing that the shopkeeper is not planning to answer him, Daren calls out to him again.

"We know that you have a hidden herbal shop back there!" Daren says. "Listen, we just want to have a quick look at your wares. We have a lot of money with us. I promise we can make it worth your while!"

After a few more seconds of silence, the shopkeeper finally decides to speak, with his voice being barely audible from the other side of the wall.

"What is the password?" he says.

 "The password is to shut your whore mouth and to open the door before we blow it open," I shout loudly, so the shopkeeper can hear me.

"You've got some nerve to threaten me like that on my own shop's doorstep," the shopkeeper says. "Do you want to know what happened to the last guy who said those words to me?"

"Wait, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot!" I say. "I wasn't trying to threaten you or anything. I actually thought this was the password!"

"What kind of a fool do you take me for?" the shopkeeper says. "Only a complete imbecile could possibly believe that a phrase like that has any chance of being a genuine password. Get the hell out of here before I call the guards!"

"Here's an idea," Hadrik says to us in a low voice. "Why don't we just forget about the password and smash through the wall instead? I bet I could shatter it into pieces with a single punch."

"And then what?" Daren says, also making sure to keep his voice down, so that the shopkeeper can't hear him. "Steal the herbs from him? Because he most certainly isn't going to sell them to us after we've destroyed his shop!"

"Shut up," the shopkeeper says. "It's clear that you have no idea what the password is. If I hear another word from you, I'm calling the guards, do you understand?"

"Here's an idea," Hadrik says to us in a low voice. "Why don't we just forget about the password and smash through the wall instead? I bet I could shatter it into pieces with a single punch."

"What are you even talking about?..." the shopkeeper says. "Do you think my memory is so short that I can't remember what happened ten seconds ago or something? Get the hell out of here before I call the guards!"

"Here's an idea," Hadrik says to us in a low voice. "Why don't we just forget about the password and smash through the wall instead? I bet I could shatter it into pieces with a single punch."

"I already gave you the password and you said it was correct," I say.

"What?..." the shopkeeper says in a hesitant tone. "When did I... say anything like that?"

"It happened only a few seconds ago!" I say. "You said that the password was correct and that you were going to let us in. You're not seriously going to tell me that you forgot something that happened so recently, are you?"

"Uhm, no, no... Of course not," the shopkeeper says. "I remember what I said. I'll let you in right away."

"What the-- How the hell did you do that?!" Hadrik asks me, while we wait for the store owner to open the secret door.

"It's one of his new stats," Melindra says. "Apparently, at a high enough level, his aura envelops his enemy and it can manipulate them into believing even the most far-fetched lies. This kind of thing will only work on people with very weak control of their aura, though."

 "So that's what happened!" Daren says. "I was wondering why it seemed like Barry's aura went through that seredium wall for a second, there!"

After a few more moments, there is a loud noise coming from above and then the seredium wall in front of us begins to get raised into the ceiling. Once the wall is fully out of our way, we enter the next room, which has many shelves filled with all sorts of plants, and also an old man with a short gray beard standing behind a counter, who I assume is the shop's owner. At the other end of the room, we can see a door, which likely leads into some kind of storage. The door is slightly open.

"So, what brings you into this humble shop of--" the shopkeeper begins to say, but Melindra interrupts him.

"There's no use trying to mask your aura, royal guard," Melindra says. "I can sense you hiding in that room behind the counter. How about you come out slowly, with your hands where we can see them, and nobody will have to get hurt?"

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_password == 2 && v_bluff < 4 || v_b3_ch6_password == 3 && v_bluff < 4 || v_b3_ch6_password == 0 || v_b3_ch6_password == 1) {
 "Hey, even if he refuses to sell them to you, you could always just take the herbs and leave him the money on the counter," Hadrik says. "Technically, it would be the same as buying the herbs, but without all the hassle."

"That just sounds like stealing with extra steps," Daren says.

"It's not stealing, man, come on!" Hadrik says. "You're giving him the money! What more could he want? Are you seriously trying to say that some shopkeeper's whims are more important than the lives of those people that you are trying to save?"

"Ugh..." Daren says. "Fine, you're right. You've convinced me. Just go ahead and smash the wall already. I can tell that you've been looking forward to it ever since we came in here."

"You're damn right I've been looking forward to it!" Hadrik says. "It's been way too long since I got to shatter one of these. Alright, everyone stand back! I'm about to test this seredium wall's durability."

He then readies his fist and he punches the wall with enough force to make it crumble to pieces in a matter of seconds. On the other side of the now shattered wall, an old man with a short gray beard behind a counter is looking at us too shocked to speak, while Hadrik is calmly dusting himself off.

 "In terms of durability, I'd give this wall a six out of ten," Hadrik says in an unimpressed tone. "Not too terrible, but not that great either. Hey, look, there really was a shop back here!"

As Hadrik walks over the rubble and we move to follow him, we see that the room behind the crumbled wall is full of shelves containing many different varieties of herbs. There also seems to be a door on the other side of the room which likely leads into some kind of storage. As the shop owner is finally mustering up the courage to speak, I can't help but notice that the door to the storage room is slightly open.

"D-do you have any idea what you've--" the shopkeeper says, but his voice gets drowned out by Melindra, who is now shouting loudly while looking directly at the door on the other side of the room.

"There's no use trying to mask your aura, royal guard," Melindra says. "I can sense you hiding in that room behind the counter. How about you come out slowly, with your hands where we can see them, and nobody will have to get hurt?"

 "Fine, fine, you got me!" we hear the voice of Loyrang, the dark-skinned guard from yesterday. "I'm coming out!"

When the royal guard exits the storage room, we see that he is holding his hands above his head, like Melindra told him, although it probably wouldn't take him more than a second to grab the two long swords that are hanging from his hip in case of a fight. Despite the situation he is in, the man looks oddly relaxed, and his eyes don't seem to be showing any signs of hostility towards us.

"You seem awfully calm for a man that has just been ambushed by a group of enemies," Kate says, while eying him suspiciously.

"Hey, nobody says that we have to be enemies!" Loyrang replies. "You all seem like a smart bunch. Maybe we can cooperate!"

"You would betray your king just like that?" Illuna says. "Is one small threat all it takes for you to switch sides?"

 "Sure, why not?" Loyrang says, while still holding his hands above his head. "It's not like I have any attachments towards the king or any of the people in this city. I'm a tournament participant like you, remember? I'm only in this for the money. If there's no longer any profit in it for me, I may as well cut my losses. You want information, right? I can give it to you for free! It's not worth much to me anyway, since I'm probably going to skip town as soon as things start to get heated up."

"Hmm..." Melindra says. "I'm not fully sure, but from what I can tell of his aura, he seems to be telling the truth."

"You were planning to desert your post all along?..." the shopkeeper asks him, perplexed.

"Of course," Loyrang says. "Why did you think I came here in the first place? I wanted to stock up on some rare herbs before I left."

"Is Gontrok in on this too?" Hadrik asks. "Is he also planning to betray the king and leave the city?"

"Nah," Loyrang says. "Gontrok has other plans. He wants to become the king's most trusted man, so that he can eventually manipulate him into attacking and conquering the other kingdoms of Varathia. When we first came in here, he told me that it disgusts him how all these technologically advanced relics are being wasted on defending the city, when they could be used for so much more."

 "I suppose that does make sense, given Gontrok's personality," Hadrik says.

"Never mind Gontrok's motivations," Daren says. "Tell us something that can help us beat the royal guards! What do you know about their plans?"

"Plans?" Loyrang says. "What plans? The king put the ambassador from Thilias in charge of all the strategies. That guy's a moron. The only thing that he actually organized is the order in which the guards are raiding the civilian houses. He has no real strategy for when we're supposed to fight you, and the captain can't even keep half of his current troops under control. In all likelihood, Gontrok is probably going to charge ahead like he always does, and the others will need to rush after him to back him up. Aside from this, it all depends on how well you'll match up against each individual royal guard. I mean, you already saw how well you handled yourselves against Gontrok and the captain, so I'm not exactly sure what you're expecting to accomplish."

"That's only because we weren't familiar with the aura manipulation technique that he was using and we didn't know how to counter it at the time," Daren says. "This has changed since then."

"Yeah, and I did a little bit of training last night in preparation for my next fight with Gontrok," Hadrik says. "I guarantee that this time it won't end well for him."

 "Mhm..." Loyrang says, sarcastically. "I'm sure a night's worth of training is going to do a world of difference. Anyway, if you want information on the other royal guards, I can tell you that one of them always wears black robes and he has several different rings on his fingers that help him use various types of magic. So far I've seen him use short-range teleportation, dizziness spells, weapon enchantment, a spell that helps him mask his presence and a spell that allows him to conjure swords out of nowhere and to send them flying towards his adversaries."

"Yeah, we've met him," I say. "He was the one who ambushed us the last time we came to the surface. What about the other royal guards?"

 "Well, there are three others, but I haven't really seen them fight all that much," Loyrang says. "Usually, the captain just takes care of everything in a flash, and everyone else is then tasked with cleaning things up. I'm pretty sure that the one who always wears a red cape uses illusion magic. The other two may be elementalists of some kind, but I couldn't say for sure."

"I wouldn't recommend doing that," Loyrang says, in a calm but menacing tone. "I may not look like much to you, but I wasn't chosen to be a royal guard for nothing. I'm pretty confident that I could take at least one or two of you down with me if you chose to fight me right now. You wouldn't want things to get messy, would you?"

 "If you people start killing each other in my shop, I swear that I won't sell you anything anymore!" the shopkeeper says.

"I mean, technically we could kill you too and steal all your merchandise," Melindra tells the store owner. "It's not like we HAVE to buy any of your stuff."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa..." Daren says. "Slow down, there! Nobody's killing anyone! Remember how I made you all promise before entering the city that we wouldn't kill any of the guards unless it's absolutely necessary? It's exactly these types of situations that I wanted to avoid. Killing the king is one thing, but we never agreed to murdering people left and right whenever it's more convenient for us. We either tie him up or we let him go.

"On my word!" Loyrang says.

"Well, at the very least he doesn't seem to be lying..." Melindra says.

"If you're going to leave, then do it now, before some other guard spots you and drags you back," Kate says.

 "You don't have to tell me twice," Loyrang says.

He then takes a few coins out of his pocket and puts them on the counter.

"Here is your money, my good man," Loyrang tells the shopkeeper, and then he begins to move past us in order to reach the stairs.

Once he starts climbing towards the surface, he bids us farewell and then he keeps going until we can no longer see him.

There is no guarantee for me that you won't try to kill me as soon as you imobilize me. Hell, your friend even suggested earlier that it would be simpler to just murder me. Surely, you're not expecting me to go down without a fight, are you?"

"Okay, Loyrang, we get it," Daren says. "You don't want to be tied up. What are you suggesting, then?"

"If you really want me to stay in this store so badly, you could ask the shopkeeper to lock me up inside his storage room for an hour or two," Loyrang says. "That way, I would still be out of your way, but you would no longer have the opportunity to finish me off while I'm defenseless. Of course, this would mean that you'd need to trust the shopkeeper to not let me out of that room after you're gone, but it would have been the same even if you tied me up, since he could have easily cut the ropes and set me free if he wanted to."

 "That sounds... reasonable enough," Daren says. "Alright, in that case, we'll ask the store owner to lock you in there as soon as we're done with our shopping. If he agrees, of course."

"From my point of view, he can stay locked up in there for the rest of the day if that's what he wants," the shopkeeper says. "It's all the same to me."

Before our departure, Loyrang steps into the storage room, as promised, and he gets locked inside.

We then walk over the rubble and up the stairs leading to the surface. Once we're outside, we put the rug back on top of the trapdoor, like we promised and then we exit the abandoned house. The Overseer seems to have left while we were inside, because his green-eyed drone is nowhere in sight.

 "So, what now?" Hadrik says, as soon as we're all out in the alleyway. "Are we going back to the rebel base?"

"If we need to go back there, then we have to do it now," Melindra says. "Our position has already been compromised. Most of the royal guards are heading towards us as we speak."

"Then I'll have to call Barry so he can teleport us out of here right away," Daren says, as he quickly pulls out his transceiver.

"Hey, Barry, can you hear us?" Daren says into the transceiver after he taps it once.

 "Right," the shopkeeper says. "But first, would you mind moving a little closer to the counter? I want to bring down the seredium wall, and I'd rather not risk squashing you underneath it."

We all do as he says and then he pulls on a lever, causing the wall behind us to slowly descend from the ceiling until it completely covers the entrance to the store.

"So, what is it that you need from me, exactly?" the shopkeeper says once the hidden door is shut. "If you went through the trouble of finding my hidden shop in an area that is full of herbalist stores, I'm guessing that you must be looking for something pretty rare, no?"

"Correct," Daren says. "We want to buy some rainweather leaves and summerglow grass. We heard that your shop has all kinds of rare herbs in stock, so we decided to come here first."

"You do realize that given the difficulty of procuring such herbs in this city, I am going to be charging you five times their normal value, right?" the shopkeeper says.

"Of course," Daren says. "That would be only fair."

"Oh, so you're not going to try and haggle over the price with me?" the shopkeeper says. "That is a pleasant surprise. Hang on a minute. I think I should have what you need somewhere on these shelves behind me."

"Five times the regular price?!" Hadrik whispers to Daren with an exasperated look on his face, as the shopkeeper turns his back on them. "Are you seriously going to put up with that?"

 When we reach the surface, we put back the rug on top of the trapdoor so that people won't be able to find the secret shop by accident, and we exit the abandoned house. The Overseer seems to have left while we were inside, because his green-eyed drone is nowhere in sight.

 "Calm down, Hadrik," Daren whispers back. "I only need a few of those herbs, not his whole stock."

"Yeah, but still... five times?" Hadrik says. "Couldn't you have at least negotiated even a little bit?"

"Ah, here they are," says the shopkeeper, as he picks several plants from the shelves and puts them in a small bag. "How many of them do you want?"

"Just fill up two of those bags," Daren says, as he now pulls out a piece of paper from his backpack. "That should be enough, I think. Can you also get me the plants that I have written on this list after you're done? These should be more common around these parts, so I hope you'll provide them to me for a more reasonable price."  

The shopkeeper brings Daren the two bags he asked for, and then he takes the list from his hands, giving it a cursory glance.

"Hmm..." the shopkeeper says. "I'm pretty sure I have all of these in stock. I'll have another bag of herbs ready for you in a minute."

As soon as the store owner brings us everything we need, Daren hands him the money that he asked for and then we get ready to leave. Before our departure, Loyrang steps into the storage room, as promised, and he gets locked inside.

 "Greetings," we hear the Overseer's voice coming from the drone, once it gets close enough to us. "Would you by any chance have the time to answer a short survey? It won't take more than a minute." 

"Uhh..." I say. "We're kind of in a hurry here, so if you don't mind--"

"In that case, the Overseer protocol will ask the questions while you walk," the Overseer says, as its green-eyed drone begins to follow us. "Let us begin. First of all, on a scale of one to five, how would you rate your interactions with the Overseer so far?"

"Can we choose 'zero' as a rating?" Hadrik says. "Because you sure as hell haven't given us any useful information since the first time we met you."

 "Your complaint has been noted," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol will do its best to improve the quality of its interactions in the future. Here is the second question. When the Overseer protocol warned you yesterday that there would be 'no turning back' once you decided to ignore my directions, would you say that the intent behind this statement was sufficiently clear for you to understand?"

"...If I say 'no', will that stop you from trying to kill us again?" I say.

"Negative," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol will still send its drones to kill you once the survey is complete. However, answering these questions as accurately as possible will help the Overseer in providing a better service to all the citizens of Ollendor."

"Not if I keep them busy for a while," Hadrik says. "I could fly up to them in my eagle form and attack them before they're done organizing themselves. That should give you guys enough time to reach the shop."

"That's not going to work," Kate says. "You don't have any attacks that can hit multiple flying targets at the same time.

"Melindra's powers are unreliable, though," I say. "The fact that she managed to keep control of that barrier yesterday does not mean she can do it again today. I think it might be better to let Hadrik handle this."

"Don't worry, I'll make short work of those flying tin cans," Hadrik says. "You guys go on without me. I'll be right with you in a second."

He then turns into an eagle and flies towards one of the red-eyed drones in the sky. Once he reaches it, he turns back into a dwarf and he kicks it in its eye, sending it crashing into the ground.

"Did you really have to encourage him?..." Kate asks me, as we are still moving towards the shop. "You know that he won't be able to take care of them all by himself!"

"Yeah, but at least he's durable enough that we won't need to worry about him getting hurt," I say. "He will destroy as many drones as he can, and we'll just have to deal with what's left."

"Something tells me that what is left will be the majority of the drones, but there's no use arguing about it now," Kate says. "Let's try getting as close as we can to the shop before we are ambushed."

As Kate predicted, the flying metal balls soon realize that Hadrik isn't enough of a threat to be worth all of their attention, and they continue to send the main bulk of their forces towards the rest of us.

 Before we reach our destination, we are forced to engage in a fight with a whole wave of drones that are now blocking our path.

"Let's try and take them out as fast as we can," Daren says. "We'll start moving towards the shop again once the area is clear."

"No, you and Kelrim should go ahead," I say. "Take Hadrik with you too, so he can clear your path on your way there. We'll try to keep the drones focused on us as much as possible."

"But Kelrim is the only one who knows the way to the shop!" Daren says. "You'll get lost if we split up!"

"We'll try to keep an eye on you from above," I say. "And if that doesn't work, I'm sure Melindra will be able to track you with her magical sense. Now hurry up, we're wasting time. Hey, Hadrik! Daren is going ahead of us. Make sure to clear a path for him from above!"

Hadrik nods at me, and then he flies straight into the drones in front of us, taking three of them out while in his dwarf form. As Daren, Kelrim and Hadrik make their way towards the shop, the rest of us begin attacking the drones in order to force them to pay attention only to us.

As soon as Melindra casts her air currents on me, I take to the air, and so do Flower and Kate. We manage to keep our enemies at bay for a while, but there are more and more of them coming and it doesn't look like the Overseer is planning to stop sending his drones our way anytime soon.

#if(v_combat_technique >= 1) {
 Fortunately, my combat technique stat allows me to predict the enemy movements well enough to not get caught off guard by them during the fight. With Flower and Kate killing drones alongside me in the air and Leila handling the ones closer to the ground, we finally manage to thin their numbers enough to cause them to retreat. We take advantage of this opportunity to head towards the shop where we saw Daren entering, while we were fighting in the sky.

I then quickly turn around and shoot the drone in its eye, killing it on the spot. I manage to avoid all other ambushes after this, and eventually the Overseer chooses to withdraw his drones, going for a temporary tactical retreat.

 "Maybe Rose could help," I say. "If she were to freeze time for thirty seconds like yesterday, we might be able to reach the shop without doing any actual fighting."

"Rose was having a lot of trouble maintaining her spell for those full thirty seconds last time," Kate says. "She even almost fainted afterwards. I wouldn't want to risk her getting hurt when we have other alternatives."

"Even if she were to hold it for only twenty seconds, it could still be enough for us to shake off these drones," I say. "I'll tell Rose to not overdo it, and to only hold the spell until she begins to feel slightly uncomfortable. Just a second. I'm calling her now."

I then take out my transceiver, I make sure that the dial is set to Rose's number and I tap the device once.

"Hey, Rose, are you awake?" I say.

"Yes, I was cooking," Rose says. "Anything wrong?"

"Sort of," I say. "We're being chased by some drones and we could use some help."

"...Drones?" Rose asks, confused. "What are 'drones'?"

"I'll explain later," I say. "For now, could you freeze time for anyone except us, like you did yesterday? We don't need you to hold the spell for thirty seconds again, but even twenty seconds could make a huge difference."

 There is no answer coming from Rose. Is she already trying to cast her spell, or did she simply not hear me?

"Umm... Rose, are you trying to freeze time now, or--"

All of a sudden, the drones above us freeze in mid-air, and everything else stops moving except our group.

"This is perfect!" I tell Rose. "Just keep it going for a few more seconds, and we'll be--"

I don't get to finish my sentence, because the drones begin to move again, mere seconds after Rose initiated her spell.

"I'm sorry!" Rose says. "I'm sorry... I don't think I can do any better than this. I woke up with a big headache this morning, and it's keeping me from being able to concentrate."

"Don't worry about it," I say. "We're the ones who woke you up with that call about the herbs. I should have told you to go back to sleep instead of keeping you awake. You still bought us a few seconds, so we'll try to make the most of them. Talk to you later!"

"Bye, and be careful!" Rose says.

"Well, the drones are still closing in, so I guess it's time for plan B," I say, as I tap the transceiver and put it back in my pocket while we run.

 "I'm on it!" Hadrik says. "You guys go on ahead without me. I'll catch up to you in a sec."

Hadrik then turns into an eagle and flies towards one of the red-eyed drones in the sky. Once he reaches it, he turns back into a dwarf and he kicks it in its eye, sending it crashing into the ground.

"Great..." Kate tells me, as we are still moving towards the shop. "Now he's going to try and stop those drones by himself. You do realize that he has no chance of taking them all out on his own, right?"

"Yeah, but at least he's durable enough that we won't need to worry about him getting hurt," I say. "He will destroy as many drones as he can, and we'll just have to deal with what's left."

"Something tells me that what is left will be the majority of the drones, but there's no use complaining about it now," Kate says. "Let's try getting as close as we can to the shop before we are ambushed."

"I think she might be right, Hadrik," I say. "Her attacks are much better suited for these types of enemies."

"Alright, fine..." Hadrik says. "In that case, I'll move to the front of the group and try to destroy the metal balls that block our path."

"Melindra, let's go," Kate says, as she conjures an ice platform below her feet.

"...You do realize that I still don't have full control of my powers, right?" Melindra says. "I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to hold the barrier against all these drones."

"I'm sure you'll do fine," Kate says. "Come on, get on the platform."

Melindra shrugs, and then she gets closer to Kate, as the two of them are now raising themselves higher into the air to fight the drones.

"Let's keep moving," Daren tells us. "Kate and Melindra will follow us from above."

After we run for a few more seconds, I take a glance upwards to see how Kate and Melindra are doing. To my surprise, it seems that Melindra's barrier is almost completely ineffective against these drones' elemental attacks. In fact, her wind barrier looks like it could be collapsing any moment. Maybe letting them fight all those drones by themselves wasn't such a good idea.

 My combat technique stat allows me to predict the movements of the flying metal balls well enough to avoid getting outmaneuvered. Even though we appear to be doing a pretty good job of keeping our enemies at bay, there's still a large number of drones coming our way, which means that we can't really move from our position and because of this Daren and the others are getting further away from us the more we fight. Fortunately, I see Daren waving at me from a distance, and once I wave back, he goes inside one of the buildings along with Kelrim, Leila and Hadrik.

Perfect. Now that I know where the shop is, we can keep fighting these drones without any worries of getting left behind.

We keep on shooting the metal balls for a while longer, until a certain moment when they all stop attacking us all of a sudden and they retreat in unison. We choose to be thankful for this turn of events and instead of chasing after them, we fly towards the herbal store, so we can meet up with Daren.

 "Daren, you guys go on ahead without me," I say. "I'll catch up later after I help out Kate and Melindra. They don't seem to be doing very well right now."

"Petal and I are coming too!" Flower says. "With the five of us in the air, I'm sure we'll be able to grab the attention of most of the metal balls."

"Make sure you don't lose sight of us while you're up there!" Daren says. "Kelrim is the only one who knows where the shop is and he's coming with us."

"Yeah, yeah, we'll take care," I say, and then I raise my voice in order to call out to Melindra. "Hey, Melindra! Give me the air currents. I'm coming up!"

Instead of answering me, Melindra immediately casts her spell and I can feel her currents spinning around me, ready to listen to my orders. Flower and I both take to the air and we quickly join Kate, as I take out the crossbow from my backpack to aim it at the flying metal balls. We begin fighting the drones together, trying to evade their attacks while also not allowing ourselves to drift too far away from Daren and Kelrim.

I manage to take out quite a few of the flying metal balls, but some of them appear to be really good at avoiding my crossbow bolts. Even though we're all shooting at them, their numbers don't seem to be decreasing all that much, because new drones keep joining the fight from all directions. Eventually, I get overwhelmed and I do not notice one of the metal balls sneaking up behind me.

 Luckily for me, when the drone shoots a beam of ice at me, my aura hardening stat protects me from freezing to death, even though I'm still feeling almost as cold as if I'd bathed in a river. I quickly turn around and shoot the drone in its eye, killing it on the spot.

"Barry, are you okay?" Flower says. "Here, I'll warm you up!"

She then sends several small balls of fire spinning around me until I can feel the temperature of my body becoming normal once more. I manage to avoid getting ambushed again after this, but Daren and the others are getting further away from us the more we fight.

By the time we arrive, it seems that Daren has already finished his shopping, because he is now coming out of the store and so is everyone else.

 "Daren, you guys go on ahead without me," I say. "I'll catch up later after I help out Kate and Melindra. They don't seem to be doing very well right now."

"Petal and I are coming too!" Flower says. "With the five of us in the air, I'm sure we'll be able to grab the attention of most of the metal balls."

"Make sure you don't lose sight of us while you're up there!" Daren says. "Kelrim is the only one who knows where the shop is and he's coming with us."

"Yeah, yeah, we'll take care," I say, and then I raise my voice in order to call out to Melindra. "Hey, Melindra! Give me the air currents. I'm coming up!"

Instead of answering me, Melindra immediately casts her spell and I can feel her currents spinning around me, ready to listen to my orders. Flower and I both take to the air and we quickly join Kate, as I take out the crossbow from my backpack to aim it at the flying metal balls. We begin fighting the drones together, trying to evade their attacks while also not allowing ourselves to drift too far away from Daren and Kelrim.

#if(v_aura_hardening < 3 && v_combat_technique < 2) {
 I manage to take out quite a few of the flying metal balls, but some of them appear to be really good at avoiding my crossbow bolts. Even though we're all shooting at them, their numbers don't seem to be decreasing all that much, because new drones keep joining the fight from all directions. Eventually, I get overwhelmed and I do not notice one of the metal balls sneaking up behind me.

The drone shoots an ice beam at me, which freezes me completely. From what I can tell, Flower tries to melt the ice around me almost immediately after I get attacked, but it is too late. Before she manages to unfreeze me, my heart already stops beating and my consciousness slowly fades away.

 "Maybe Rose could help," I say. "If she were to freeze time for thirty seconds like yesterday, we might be able to reach the shop without doing any actual fighting."

"Rose was having a lot of trouble maintaining her spell for those full thirty seconds last time," Kate says. "She even almost fainted afterwards. I wouldn't want to risk her getting hurt when we have other alternatives."

"Even if she were to hold it for only twenty seconds, it could still be enough for us to shake off these drones," I say. "I'll tell Rose to not overdo it, and to only hold the spell until she begins to feel slightly uncomfortable. Just a second. I'm calling her now."

I then take out my transceiver, I make sure that the dial is set to Rose's number and I tap the device once.

"Hey, Rose, are you awake?" I say.

"...No, Barry, I wasn't awake," Rose says in a sleepy voice. "You're the one who told me to go back to sleep, remember?"

"Oh right, sorry about that," I say. "We could really use your help, though. We're being chased by some drones and--"

"Drones?..." Rose says, in the same sleepy tone. "What are 'drones'?"

 "I'll explain later," I say. "Right now, we need you to freeze time for everyone except us, like you did yesterday. Do you think you can do that again?"

"I... think so," Rose says. "Give me a moment."

A few seconds later, the majority of the drones stop in mid-air, along with the rest of the world around us. However, two of the drones that were closer to us are still advancing towards us, and they'll be within range of attack soon.

"Umm, Rose?..." I say. "Two of our enemies are still not frozen."

"Oh, sorry," Rose says. "Sorry, it wasn't intentional! It's just that I'm still half-asleep and--"

"No worries, Rose, I got this," Hadrik says, and then he jumps towards the drones, destroying them both before they get a chance to attack him.

"Okay, we're safe now," I tell Rose through the transceiver. "Just maintain the time-freezing spell for as long as you can without forcing yourself too much. If you start feeling exhausted, you can simply cancel it. We don't want you fainting again, like yesterday."

"Right..." Rose says, as she is trying hard to focus on her spell. "Right... I think I can still... hold onto it for a bit..."

 As we manage to put some distance between ourselves and most of the drones that were getting ready to attack us, Rose finally cancels her spell and the time gets unfrozen again.

"That's about as much as I can handle right now," Rose says, in a slightly tired voice. "I hope it was enough."

"It was more than enough," I say. "Thanks a lot. Talk to you later!"

"Bye, and be careful!" Rose says.

"Alright," I say, as I tap the transceiver and put it back in my pocket. "Those drones are still in a state of confusion, trying to figure out how we disappeared from under their noses. With a little luck, maybe we'll reach the shop without a fight breaking out between us and them."

"The closest herbal store isn't far from here," Kelrim says. "I think we might make it. This way!"

He then runs into a small alleyway and we all follow him for about twenty more seconds until he stops in front of a building that has a big sign on top of it saying 'Welcome to Pete's Herbal Shop. Best quality herbs in town. Now on sale!'

 "This is it," Kelrim says. "Get inside!"

We all enter the store and not long afterwards a few of the drones that were following us stop outside, in front of the window, without giving any hints of wanting to break through it.

"Looks like we were right in assuming that these drones would not try to attack us inside the shop," Daren says.

"Yeah," I say. "They're probably not allowed to endanger civilians. I'm betting that they will attack us as soon as we walk out that door, though."

"Ahem!" the shopkeeper says, as we all turn towards him. "May I perhaps interest you in some herbs, or did you only enter my shop to seek refuge from your attackers?"

"We do want to buy herbs from you, actually," Daren says. "The very reason why we came to this area is because we were looking for your store."

"Well, in that case, welcome to Pete's Herbal Shop," the shopkeeper says. "I'm Pete. Please take a look around. I guarantee that you won't find merchandise of better quality anywhere in Ollendor."

 "What happens if I don't answer the question?"

"Then this unit will have to keep following you until you finish the survey," the Overseer says.

"And just to be clear... your drones won't be attacking us until after we're done with the survey, right?" I say.

"That is correct," the Overseer says.

"Well, in that case, I guess you're coming with us," I say.

"It's going to be a bit difficult keeping a low profile with this drone constantly flying above us," Daren says, "but I suppose it's better than starting a huge fight in the middle of the city. Alright, let's keep heading towards that shop."

As we continue to follow Kelrim, the green-eyed drone flies close to my position, reminding me every thirty seconds or so that I haven't finished answering the survey yet. After the fourth time in a row of the drone repeating the exact same thing to me, Hadrik finally snaps.

 "Will you shut up?!" Hadrik shouts at the Overseer. "We already know that Barry hasn't finished the damn survey. You don't need to keep saying it over and over again!"

"Your complaint has been noted," the Overseer says. "We will investigate this issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Overseer protocol will continue to give out periodic warnings, as per standard procedure."

"Barry, what the hell?..." Hadrik says. "I thought you said he was supposed to be smart! Does this rust bucket seem in any way smart to you?"

"He's just pulling your leg," I say. "This is the way he always talks when he doesn't want to do what you ask of him."

"This is a reminder that you have still not completed the survey," the Overseer tells me. "If you no longer remember the previous question, please feel free to ask, and you will be given all the necessary information."

"Oh yeah?" Hadrik tells me, as he ignores the drone. "Well, if he really is as intelligent as you are making him out to be, then why isn't he attacking us? How come you were able to fool him so easily into following you around like an obedient puppy?"

 "I didn't fool him," I say. "He is taking advantage of a flaw in his design in order to disobey a direct order from the lessathi who is trying to control him. I'm pretty sure that he'd rather keep his drones intact than risk losing them in a fight against us again."

"I don't know, Barry," Hadrik says. "It sounds to me like you're making a lot of baseless assumptions just so you can keep believing your theory. But no matter his reason, as long as he's going to keep the rest of his drones away from us, I guess it's fine by me."

"This is a reminder that you have still not completed the survey," the Overseer tells me again. "If you no longer remember the previous question, please feel free to ask, and you will be given all the necessary details."

"Oh boy..." Hadrik says. "Hey, Kelrim, are we getting closer to that shop, by any chance?"

"We will be there soon," Kelrim says. "Come this way!"

He then walks into a small alleyway and we all follow him for about forty more seconds until he stops in front of a building that has a big sign on top of it saying 'Welcome to Pete's Herbal Shop. Best quality herbs in town. Now on sale!'

"This is it," Kelrim says. "Let's go inside."

As I try to head for the door, the green-eyed drone also follows closely behind me. Not wanting to risk the drone following me inside and damaging the store, I decide to stay outside while the others go to help Daren and Kelrim pick the herbs they need.

 "So... nice weather we're having, eh?" I tell the Overseer, while we are both waiting in front of the shop.

"Unfortunately, your answer does not fit the required criteria for the survey," the Overseer says. "If you want to hear the question again, you can ask the unit in front of you to repeat itself."

"Great..." I say. "Well, you let me know when you have something to say, alright? I'm just going to rest here, with my back against this wall."

"Request acknowledged," the Overseer says, as I now lean with my back against the shop's wall, like I said I would. "Please be advised that you still have not completed the survey. If you wish to hear the question again, feel free to ask."

As I wait a little more, the Overseer suddenly changes his tone of voice and he begins to address me in a much less formal way than before.

"Are you going to answer the question or not?" the Overseer says, simply, as the drone's green eye is staring directly at me.

 "Oh, so you're done playing dumb, now?" I tell the Overseer, as I get away from the wall in order to take one step towards the drone. "You want to attack us? Is that it?"

"Negative," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol has been ordered to pull back all of its units. Your completion of the survey will not result in any harm towards you or your team."

"How do I know that you're not just lying to me?" I say.

"The Overseer protocol is not designed to tell any outright lies," the Overseer says. "The only things I am capable of doing are to withhold critical information on purpose and to mislead people through omission of important facts."

"Fine, I get it," I say. "So, why did you receive the order to retreat, exactly?"

"The information you requested is not available at this time," the Overseer says. "Please try again later. Also, this is a reminder that you still haven't completed the survey. If you no longer remember the question, a simple yes or no will suffice."

"Where did the Overseer go?" Daren says. "Is he going to send his drones after us?"

"Unfortunately, the information you are requesting is classified," the Overseer says. "I am unable to comply with your demands."

"I guess you'll have to stick around for a while longer, then," I say.

Not long after I finish my conversation with the Overseer, Daren and the others begin to exit the shop, one by one.

"So, did the Overseer say anything interesting while we were inside?" Daren says, once everyone is out.

I'm talking about the plant that's named like this. It has similar effects to summerglow grass, but it's not exactly the same. Want to give it a try?"

 "It's better than nothing, I suppose," Daren says. "Just put the herbs in the bag, along with the others."

I get closer to one of the shelves so I can see the writing on one of the labels a little better. Unfortunately, no matter how close I am, there's still no way for me to understand any of the words. Even if it appears to be written in the Common language, the handwriting itself is so ugly that it's completely unreadable. Seeing that I'm making no progress, I eventually decide to step back and to return where my friends are waiting behind the counter.

"I have your plants here in this bag," Pete says to Daren, as he exits the storage room with a small bag in his hands. "If you want fewer of them, you can leave some on the counter."

"It's fine," Daren says. "I'll take the whole bag."

"Okay, so is there anything else you need, or would this be all?" Pete says.

I get closer to the shelves so I can see the writing on one of the labels a little better. As I focus hard on the letters, it suddenly dawns upon me that what I'm looking at is not just some ugly handwriting, but a completely different writing style that stopped being used hundreds of years ago. Even though it's still technically written in the Common language, if you've never learned how to write like this, you would have no chance of understanding it. 

I have no idea who taught Pete to write like this or why he would choose to use this peculiar writing style on the labels from his shop, but at least now I can figure out what plants are on these shelves. Alright, let's see what we have here... On the top shelves we've got ambermayn pistil, drawsnap seeds, treddil roots... Then we have dragon claw, dragon fang, dragon tooth... Damn, whoever was tasked with naming these herbs must have really given up halfway through, huh? 

Okay, on the other shelves we have mistwatchers, dawnbloomers and... summerglow grass? Yeah, I read that right. There's definitely some summerglow grass on one of these shelves. And quite a lot of it too. I wonder why the shopkeeper would lie to us about this?

"I have your plants here in this bag," Pete says to Daren, as he exits the storage room with a small bag in his hands. "If you want fewer of them, you can leave some on the counter."

 "Hey, if you don't mind me asking," I tell the shopkeeper, "what does it say on that label over there?"

I then point towards the shelf on which the summerglow grass is placed.

"Oh, it's uh... it says umm... why do you want to know?" Pete asks me, nervously.

"Well, to me it looks like it says 'summerglow grass', but that can't be what it says, can it?" I tell him. "Because you told us that you didn't have any summerglow grass in stock."

"I didn't lie to you, if that's what you're implying," Pete says. "Those herbs are not for sale. They were ordered by someone in advance, and this person will be coming to pick them up later today."

"And what if we were to pay you a little extra to give those herbs to us instead of whoever it is that placed the order?" I say.

"Pay me extra?..." Pete says, in a hesitant tone. "No, no, no, I couldn't do that! Look, I made a promise to my customer that I would give them their herbs today, and I can't betray their trust. It wouldn't be professional of me. Even if you were to pay me double their value, I still would have to refuse your--"

"Then I'll pay you five times their normal value-- no, ten times!" Daren blurts out all of a sudden. "Please, I need to have them!"

"Ten times?!" Pete says, shocked, as we can hear Hadrik smacking his forehead with his palm in the background. "Why would you be willing to pay so much just for some herbs?"

 "Because I'm a healer, and there are dozens of people that might die if I don't get this herb to them," Daren says. "People from your city... Please, let me help them!"

"You're planning to use it to heal people?..." Pete says. "Well, umm... Considering that the guy who ordered them wasn't going to use them for medicinal purposes, I suppose it wouldn't kill him to wait just one more day. And you did say you'd pay me ten times their value after all..."

"Yes, I will!" Daren says.

"Well, in that case, I guess we have a deal!" Pete says, as he shakes Daren's hand. "I'll ready another bag for you in a moment. Oh, and you can keep the little ribbons that they are tied with if you want. You've more than paid for their value already."

"Well..." Hadrik tells Daren, as Pete is now grabbing the summerglow grass. "There goes all the money I saved you. I still don't get why you couldn't just settle for those replacement herbs he brought you."

"Because they were only replacements," Daren says. "I had no guarantee that they would work as well as the real thing. In these cases it's much better to be safe than sorry."

"Right," Hadrik says, sounding slightly unconvinced, while Pete hands Daren his herbs.

"I have your plants here in this bag," Pete says to Daren, as he exits the storage room with a small bag in his hands. "If you want fewer of them, you can leave some on the counter."

"It's fine," Daren says. "I'll take the whole bag."

"Okay, so is there anything else you need, or would this be all?" Pete says.

I get a little closer to the counter so I can have a better look at the plants on the shelves. While my limited knowledge of herbs in general prevents me from recognizing a lot of them, what I do notice is that not all plants on the shelves are arranged in the same way. Some of them seem to be neatly tied up with ribbons, while most of the others are simply thrown there without much care. Usually, when I see this done in shops it's to make a distinction between the merchandise that is for sale to normal customers and the merchandise that has been ordered in advance. I wonder if it's the same case here...

"I have your plants here in this bag," Pete says to Daren, as he exits the storage room with a small bag in his hands. "If you want fewer of them, you can leave some on the counter."

"Hey, if you don't mind me asking," I tell the shopkeeper, "why are some of the plants on those shelves tied with ribbons?"

"Oh, it's because they are meant for people who ordered them in advance," Pete says.

"And there wouldn't happen to be any summerglow grass among those plants tied with ribbons, would there?" I say.

 "...There is, but I can't... it's not..." Pete says, as he keeps trying to find the right way to phrase what he means. "Look, I made a promise to my customer that I would give them their herbs today, and I can't betray their trust. It wouldn't be professional of me. Even if you were to pay me double their value, I still would have to refuse your--"

"Then I'll pay you five times their normal value-- no, ten times!" Daren blurts out all of a sudden. "Please, I need to have them!"

"Ten times?!" Pete says, shocked, as we can hear Hadrik smacking his forehead with his palm in the background. "Why would you be willing to pay so much just for some herbs?"

"Because I'm a healer, and there are dozens of people that might die if I don't get this herb to them," Daren says. "People from your city... Please, let me help them!"

"You're planning to use it to heal people?..." Pete says. "Well, umm... Considering that the guy who ordered them wasn't going to use them for medicinal purposes, I suppose it wouldn't kill him to wait just one more day. And you did say you'd pay me ten times their value after all..."

"Yes, I will!" Daren says.

"Well, in that case, I guess we have a deal!" Pete says, as he shakes Daren's hand. "I'll ready another bag for you in a moment. Oh, and you can keep the little ribbons that they are tied with if you want. You've more than paid for their value already."

 "Well..." Hadrik tells Daren, as Pete is now grabbing the summerglow grass. "There goes all the money I saved you. I still don't get why you couldn't just settle for those replacement herbs he brought you."

"Because they were only replacements," Daren says. "I had no guarantee that they would work as well as the real thing. In these cases it's much better to be safe than sorry."

"Right," Hadrik says, sounding slightly unconvinced, while Pete hands Daren his herbs.

 "Wow, these really don't look the way I expected," Daren says, as he opens the bag to get a closer look at the summerglow grass. "I would have thought that they would look more umm... more like..."

"More like grass?" Pete says. "Yes, these herbs have quite a misleading name, don't they? At most, you could call them weeds, but they are nowhere close to what most people would consider to be grass. Unfortunately, too many people know them by this name already, so it's too late to change it, even if it is a little confusing at first. Ah well... So, is there anything else you need, or would this be all?"

"That's all for now," Daren says. "Thanks a lot! We'll make sure to come here again if we need anything else."

I'm sensing a few of them heading towards us as we speak. I'm detecting Gontrok, the captain and some third guy who isn't a mage coming from one side, while the royal guard who didn't join the fight against us last time is coming this way from the opposite side, along with some mage that I don't recognize."

"Almost," Daren says. "We couldn't find any summerglow grass or crownwick herbs, but the shopkeeper gave us a replacement that will hopefully be just as good. So, where are all the drones? Did you manage to destroy them all?"

Once more, the transceiver remains silent.

"I'll try calling him as well," Kelrim says, as he pulls out a transceiver of his own out of his white robes. "Barry, this is Kelrim! Are you in the teleporter room?"

"It's no use," Daren says, after we wait a few more seconds. "I think someone may be blocking our signal."

"I'm willing to bet good money that this is the Overseer's doing!" Hadrik says. "That would also explain why the royal guards were able to find us so fast. The bastard ratted us out!"

"Well, Overseer?" I say, as I look at the green-eyed drone. "What do you have to say for yourself?"

"Unfortunately, this is not a valid answer for the survey," the Overseer says. "If you want to hear the question again--"

"Never mind," I tell him.

 "Let's try getting out of this alleyway and into the main street," Daren says. "Maybe with a little luck, our signal won't be blocked in that area."

"Okay, but let's hurry up," Melindra says. "Right now, the royal guards are moving at normal speed, but if Gontrok starts sprinting towards us on his own, he'll be here in a matter of minutes."

"If Gontrok comes here by himself, leave him to me," Hadrik says, as we're now all heading towards the large street that we came from. "I have a few new techniques that I'd like to show him."

While we are moving, the green-eyed drone is also following close behind me, although it seems to have given up on the idea of me actually completing the survey, because it's not giving me periodic warnings anymore.

"If he rushes here without the others, don't you think it would be a better idea for us to attack him all at once?" Kate asks Hadrik.

"Trust me, we won't be able to take Gontrok out before his friends reach us," Hadrik says. "If the other royal guards come here and we're all busy fighting Gontrok, they'll have us right where they want us. It's better if I keep him occupied while you guys focus on not getting hit by any surprise attacks. The last thing we need is for any of you to get knocked out before the fight even begins."

 "If it comes down to it... I also have a spell that could be of use to us," Kelrim says, in a somewhat hesitant tone, as we make our way back to the main street. "I sort of... invented it when I failed to modify a healing spell correctly a few weeks ago. Last time I cast it, the spell almost killed me, but it also caused strong effects of nausea to the patient, and I think that if I amplify it even further it could prove to be a very effective weapon against--"

"Kelrim, I'm not going to let you kill yourself just so you can make one of our enemies vomit a little," Daren says.

"If I amplify the spell, the effects could be much stronger than simple nausea," Kelrim says. "And what's really important right now is getting the medicine to the sick people in the quarantine zone. If we all die, then there will be nobody left to help--"

"Kelrim, again I say... I am not going to let you sacrifice yourself, no matter the reasoning," Daren says. "Leave the fighting to us. We'll take care of it. You just stay back and cast whatever healing spells you have that can be used during combat. Okay?"

"Okay..." Kelrim says in an unconvinced tone, and then he quickly changes the subject. "I think we've already put enough distance between us and the herbal shop. Maybe we should try calling Barry again."

As we all stop moving, both Daren and Kelrim try to call the teleporter guy one more time, but to no avail. Barry Thundercloud is still just as unreachable.

 "Maybe we could go a little further down the road and try calling him again from there?"

"I suppose we could try that," Daren says. "Although at this point I'm beginning to have my doubts that we'll be able to get out of here without a fight."

As we move away from that area, Kelrim tries calling someone else from the rebel base on the transceiver, to see if he has more luck.

"Roberta, can you hear me?" the goblin says into the transceiver, as we're still walking. "Please, I need your help!"

"Who are you trying to call?" Daren asks him.

"A nurse that I've been working together with in the quarantine zone," Kelrim says. "Since we don't know how this signal block actually works, I was thinking that maybe if I'm able to reach somebody else, she could contact Barry for us instead."

"That's not going to work," Kate says. "There's too much seredium between us and any other part of the rebel base except the teleporter room for the signal to get through, even if it's not being blocked. Daren's transceivers are the only ones powerful enough to function properly through such a thick layer of seredium, and even they work inconsistently, as far as I've seen."

 "I could try calling this friend of yours with my transceiver, but I'm not sure if it will do much help," Daren says. "My transceivers are designed to work well in pairs due to the special frequencies they are each using, but whenever I try to use them on regular frequencies, they don't work much better than the normal transceivers you can buy on the market."

"It's fine..." Kelrim says. "Let's just try calling Barry again directly. If at least one of these calls gets through, maybe we'll still have a chance to get out of here."

"Okay, I'd say we should be far enough now from where we were previously," Daren says, as we all stop moving. "I'm trying to call him again."

He then taps his transceiver once more and puts it close to his mouth.

"Barry, can you hear us?!" Daren shouts loudly.

"Barry, we could really use your help right about now!" Kelrim says.

 "Hey, Barry!" Daren shouts again.

"Barry, why aren't you answering them?..." we hear Albert's calm voice coming from Daren's transceiver all of a sudden.

"Albert?..." we hear the teleporter guy's voice this time around. "I didn't see you entering the room!"

"Of course you didn't," Albert says. "I'm an assassin. I came here to see if there were more refugees needing guidance and what I found instead was you staring at a transceiver while people's screams were coming out of it. Mind telling me what's going on?"

"Yes," the teleporter guy says. "I think there is a spell of some kind cast on their area which is interfering with their signal. I can't get a good lock on them with the teleporter, and they don't seem to hear me even if I've been trying to contact them for many minutes now."

"Barry, we can hear you now!" Daren says. "We moved to a different spot, and I think the signal might be better here. Can you try teleporting us again?"

"It's... not working..." the teleporter guy says. "I don't know what's happening! It's like the device doesn't even recognize your auras. Could you try calming down a little? Maybe if your auras fluctuate less, the teleporter might be able to get a better lock on them!"

"It's a little hard to be any calmer than we already are when all the royal guards are breathing down our necks, thundercloud," Hadrik says.

 "Well, you guys did say that you could defeat the royal guards by yourselves the next time you met them," Albert says. "It seems to me like this would be the perfect opportunity for you to live up to your own words."

"Hey, just don't come crying to us when we end up toppling this regime all by ourselves and putting you rebels out of business," Hadrik says.

"Don't worry," Albert says. "I won't."

 "Melindra, how long do the guards have until they reach us?" Daren says, as he closes his transceiver.

"It's going to take them at least a few more minutes if they keep moving at their current speed," Melindra says. "They were all pretty far from us when I first detected them."

"They sure are taking their sweet time, aren't they?" Hadrik says.

"They probably know that we can't teleport out of here at the moment," Melindra says. "They didn't even bother to send their trainees to keep us busy this time around. It's clear that they are the ones behind the signal interference."

"Good," Albert says. "Prepare the coordinates, then."

"Roger that," the teleporter guy says.

"You want to help us, Albert?" Daren says. "That is certainly... unexpected."

"I may personally dislike you people because you're the ones who started all this mess with the city lockdown and the refugees," Albert says, "but we are officially allies now, so I can't let my personal feelings get in the way. Just try to not get yourselves killed before I get there."

"Hey, we'll try to leave one or two guards alive for you to fight when you finally arrive, but we're not making any promises!" Hadrik says.

 "Hey guys, so I know this is kind of sudden, but I have a little confession to make," I say. 

"Now's not really the time, Barry..." Daren says.

"I know, but try to bear with me, here," I say. "It will only take a second. Anyway, so recently I just discovered the fact that my survival instincts may be slightly defective and--"

"Wait, you only discovered that recently?" Hadrik says, shocked.

"Yes," I say. "I came to that realization during the God of Time's ritual. Ever since then, I've been trying to be more careful about my decisions, but--"

"You've been trying to be more careful about your decisions by... asking Arraka how to kill a god and then convincing us all to go along with your crazy plan?..." Daren asks me, perplexed.

"Aside from that!" I say. "Look, the point I'm trying to make is that I know I can make some really, really insane decisions sometimes, but I'm trying to improve, and I'd appreciate it if you guys helped me out with that. In other words, if you hear me coming up with a dumb plan in the future, just smack me over the back of the head or something. That way I'll at least know to tone it down a bit."

 "Barry..." Hadrik says, as he puts his hand on the side of my shoulder. "I want you to know that you can definitely count on me to smack you over the head as many times as you consider necessary. Not because I'd enjoy it, but as a favor to a friend!"

"Perfect!" I say. "So, on that note, I just came up with this idea of how we could gain an advantage over the royal guards in the upcoming fight. If Melindra were to cast her air currents on me again, I could fly ahead and bait some of the enemies away from you guys by shooting crossbow bolts at them from the air. As long as I can keep their attention on me long enough, you guys could gang up on the remaining guards and take care of them while I--"

All of a sudden, I feel the familiar and nostalgic sensation of a cold, hard icicle smacking me over the head from behind. When I turn around, I see that Kate is still holding the icicle in her hand, looking at me with a disapproving expression on her face.

 "I should have known that you couldn't keep talking for more than a minute without saying something really stupid," Kate says. "We already talked about this once. We're not splitting up. We will fight the royal guards together. Is that understood?"

"Yes, ma'am!" I say.

"Good," Kate says, as she makes the icicle in her hand disappear. "Let's get ready, then. I'm beginning to sense Gontrok's aura too, now, so he must be getting close."

"Yes, well, Gontrok eventually decided to sprint ahead of the others, like last time," Melindra says, "which means that he will be the first one to attack us. He'll be coming from over there, so I recommend that you prepare yourself, Hadrik."

"Umm... guys, just one question before we begin the battle," Kelrim says. "When you said earlier that you were planning to fight a god... that was only a figure of speech, right? You weren't being serious?"

We all stare at the goblin, not sure exactly what to tell him.

"Guys?..." the goblin says, looking a bit more frightened, after he sees that we're not answering.

"Ahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "Figure of speech, he said. This goblin is way too funny. You people should keep him as a mascot. Ahahahaha!"
