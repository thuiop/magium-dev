"You're right..." Daren tells Hadrik, after looking around himself for a few seconds. "The time really is frozen. Could it be Eiden's doing?"

"It's not Eiden," Arraka says. "If Eiden were here, I would have told you about it, remember?"

"Then who is it?" Daren asks. "Who froze the time?"

"Why don't you take a look and see for yourself?" Arraka says. "She is coming out of the woods and heading your way as we speak."

"She?..." Daren says.

As we all take a look at the person who is now slowly approaching us, we recognize her immediately. Rose is currently walking very slowly towards us, while her eyes are shining with a bright yellow light. Her expression is completely blank, as she looks straight ahead of her, without acknowledging our presence.

 "The revenant, again..." Daren says, with a cold look on his face. "Come on, let's see what she wants."

We all do as Daren says, and we head over to the revenant, until we are right in front of her. As soon as we reach her, the revenant stops in her tracks, and she continues to stare straight ahead, with the same blank expression on her face.

"Why did you come here, revenant?" Daren asks her. "And why did you freeze time?"

The revenant does not react to Daren's words in any way. She doesn't even seem to be aware of our presence. It's as if she were in some sort of... trance.

We all do as Daren says, and we head over to Rose, until we are right in front of her. As soon as we reach her, Rose stops in her tracks, and she continues to stare straight ahead, with the same blank expression on her face.

"Rose, can you hear us?" Kate says.

Rose does not react to Kate's words in any way. She doesn't even seem to be aware of our presence. It's as if she were in some sort of... trance.

 "Are you listening to us?..." I say.

Seeing that the revenant is still not doing anything, I position myself right in front of her, and I begin to snap my fingers repeatedly, very close to her face.

"Come on!" I say. "Snap out of it!"

"Oh, no..." Melindra says. "I've seen something like this happen before. If it's what I think it is, then you guys had better ready yourselves up. That sage fight from earlier is going to feel like a walk in the park, compared to what's coming up next."

"They're going to be in for a treat, alright!" Arraka says, and then she laughs.

"What are you two talking about?" Hadrik says. "Ready ourselves up for what?"

"It's starting..." Melindra says.

 All of a sudden, the revenant disappears from before our eyes, and we can hear her voice coming from behind us. As we all turn around, we realize that it wasn't only her voice, but the revenant herself who had switched positions, in a fraction of a second. The voice that is coming out of her mouth barely sounds like that of Rose, due to the high amount of reverberation in it.

"A prophecy, I have come to tell you..." the revenant says.

"Here we go," Arraka says.

"A prophecy of things that may come to pass, but which have not yet been set in stone," the revenant continues. "Listen carefully, to the events that will be foretold, and you may be able to prevent them from happening, before it is too late."

The revenant then disappears again, and she reappears on our left side, preparing to speak again, as the echo in her voice gets more intense, in order to signify the beginning of the prophecy. After each line that she speaks, the revenant disappears and appears in a different place, making us all turn our heads in confusion.

Seeing that she still isn't doing anything, I position myself right next to her, and I begin to wave my hand in front of her eyes.

A great disaster that has once been avoided

An entire continent lies in ruins,

While a single laugh made up from different voices

Echoes loudly throughout the realm."

As soon as the revenant is done delivering the prophecy, she stops moving, and once again, she begins to stare into space, with a blank expression on her face.

A prophecy about a great disaster... Two old enemies... Does this mean that we were right? The calamity that Eiden warned us about will happen when he clashes with Tyrath? But then again, the prophecy also mentioned a laugh made up from different voices. And I only know of one person who could fit this description...

"Arraka..." I say. "This prophecy was oddly specific about that single laugh made up from different voices thing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about this 'great disaster', would you?"

 Melindra interrupts herself, because we can all suddenly feel an immense amount of pressure in the air, making it hard to breathe, while the sky looks like it's trembling under the sheer force of the magical power that has flooded our entire area. As we slowly adapt to the pressure and begin to breathe more normally, the revenant is getting raised higher and higher into the air, while her eyes are still bright yellow, staring into nothingness.

"What the hell?!" Hadrik shouts. "What is with this crazy amount of magical power? Arraka is still in the amulet, isn't she?"

"Ahahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs, from inside her amulet.

"This is not Arraka's doing," Melindra says, as she struggles to remain calm. "I already told you. That sage battle from earlier will seem like nothing, compared to what's about to happen."

"I think I'd rather figure it out by myself, if you don't mind," I say.

"Your loss," Arraka says.

"So, is this it?..." Daren says. "Is the prophecy over?"

"If you're asking only about the prophecy, then yes, it is over," Melindra says.

"You're saying that we should be expecting something else, right after the prophecy?" Daren says.

"Only if everything happens in the same way that it did six hundred years ago," Melindra says. "The last time I've had the honor of witnessing a time weaver's prophecy, I didn't have to wait long until--"

 She then kneels before the God of Time, with her head bowed down, while she signals Daren to do the same.

An adversary that can make even someone as proud as Melindra act this way? I don't like where this is going. Clearly, if I mess around here, I could end up getting everyone killed. But should I really kneel before this bastard?

While I was standing there, considering my options, the God of Time was slowly materializing into a more earthly form, although I'm not sure if I could really call it that. His body has the form and the size of a human, but it is made out of a sort of solid blue light, which is simply radiating magical energy. The man has no face, and no distinguishable features, aside from a few small blue flames that keep appearing and disappearing randomly throughout his body, at random short time intervals. He is currently floating in mid-air, next to the revenant, and he is looking straight at us, with his empty face.

"It is not wise to keep a god waiting..." the God of Time says. "I told you to kneel."

"Don't listen to what he says," Arraka tells us. "He needs you alive for his plans to work. He can't do anything to you. He's just bluffing."

 She is right. I don't think I've experienced such a feeling of dread, ever since I saw Arraka get out of her amulet. It's like every single fiber of my being is telling me to run the hell away from here, as far as possible, and as fast as my feet can carry me. I can't let this fear overcome me. Not now. I'm almost certain that even the smallest wrong decision made at this point could lead to my instant obliteration. Just who is it exactly, that we are facing, here?

"Greetings, mortals..." we hear several male voices, speaking in unison, all around us.

This speech pattern is very similar to the way in which Arraka speaks sometimes, when she loses control over her voice. A laugh made up from several different voices... Could this be tied to the prophecy as well?

"You have been blessed by the presence of a god," the voices say, as they reverberate throughout the entire area. "Kneel before me, and I will then give you permission to gaze upon my magnificent form, in admiration."

"And just who exactly--" Daren starts to say, but Melindra puts her hand over his mouth to silence him, with a panicked look on her face.

"This is the God of Time," Melindra says. "Don't ask him any questions. He has the power to end us all in a matter of seconds. Just... kneel..."

 Despite what Arraka said, I decide not to risk everyone's safety for the sake of my pride, and I kneel in front of the God of Time, just like Melindra.

"If you want to see me kneeling, then I hope you've brought a chair," Daren tells the God of Time, "because you're going to be waiting for a while."

Just as Daren is done talking, we see his heart being ripped straight out of his chest and right through his plate armor by an invisible force, as blood begins to splatter all out of him. 

"Oh no..." Hadrik says, as the rest of us all watch Daren, too shocked to speak.

When Daren is almost about to fall to the ground, I hear Hadrik starting to talk in reverse, and then I see Daren's heart going back inside his chest by itself, while all of the blood on the ground and on his armor gets cleaned up instantly. As soon as the time reversal spell is over, Daren begins to breathe very loudly and rapidly, while sweating all over, as if he'd just woken up from a terrible nightmare.

Arraka laughs, when she sees the look on his face.

"I guess I forgot that he can also reverse time, as long as he has control of the time weaver," Arraka says. "My bad!"

 "I will not repeat myself again," the God of Time says. "Kneel."

Kate and the others exchange a few hesitant looks, but it doesn't seem as if any of them are planning to follow the god's orders, even after his previous display of power.

"Sorry," Hadrik says, with half a grin, while trying to mimic his usual confident tone. "My doctor told me that kneeling is bad for my--"

"I said KNEEL!" the god shouts, and then an immense amount of pressure pushes us all to the ground, including Melindra and me, who were already kneeling.

We are now all being squashed against the rocky soil by an incredible force, and I can already feel the pain from my internal organs bleeding, as the enormous pressure above us just keeps getting more and more unbearable. In order to make sure that he doesn't kill us, the God of Time keeps casting time reversal spells every ten seconds or so, thus healing our internal wounds, just so they can be reformed again and again, over the course of the next few minutes. 

During this time, I can't manage to pay attention to anything around me. Every ounce of my energy is being focused into withstanding the pain. I can no longer tell if the screams that I'm hearing are coming from me, or from my friends. It's as if I've voluntarily entered some sort of trance, trying to become one with the pain. Trying to let it flow through me. No matter how hard I try, however, the pain keeps getting the better of me, and then I need to regain my focus all over again.

 "Arraka is right," I say. "We shouldn't have to kneel before anyone. Even if they are gods. No matter what happens, I am going to stand my ground."

As soon as I am done talking, I suddenly feel a very intense pain in the left side of my chest, and when I look down, I see, to my horror, that my heart has been ripped straight out of me, and that I now have a huge, bloody hole in my chest, where my heart used to be.

"Barry!!!" Kate shouts, in desperation.

Everything is now getting much colder, and I can feel shivers all throughout my body. The light before my eyes is slowly starting to fade, while I am gradually losing my consciousness. Right before it all goes dark, however, I suddenly regain my senses, as I hear Kate shouting my name in reverse. Immediately afterwards, my heart gets put back into my chest, while my wound closes completely, with all the blood disappearing from my shirt almost instantly. As soon as the time reversal spell is over, I start to breathe very loudly and rapidly, while sweating all over, as if I'd just woken up from a terrible nightmare.

Just as I'm done talking, I suddenly feel an unbearable pain all throughout my upper body, as several of my internal organs get crushed in a matter of seconds. I then cough out some blood, and I notice that aside from my crushed organs, my heart has also been ripped straight out of me, leaving a huge bloody hole on the left side of my chest.

Upon hearing Arraka's words, the God of Time casts one last time-reversal spell, and then he lowers the amount of pressure in the air above us, making sure that he is no longer hurting us, but still keeping us pressed against the ground.

"THANK you!" Arraka says, in the same exasperated tone.

"I see that living amongst these mortals has taught you some long-overdue basic etiquette, Arraka," the God of Time says. "It is regrettable that you could not learn these manners before we were forced to banish you from our realm."

"Forced?..." Arraka says. "Hah! You only did it because you were afraid of me. It's funny, because while we were both living in the magical plane, I hadn't pegged you as the cowardly type. And yet, twice, you ran away from me. Once with the banishment, and a second time six hundred years ago. What happened to that unfinished duel of ours, eh? Didn't you say that we would settle our scores, eventually?"

 "Well, if you would just destroy this amulet for me, we could--" Arraka starts to say, but she is interrupted by the God of Time.

"You will receive no help from me," the God of Time says. "Don't think I've forgotten about the many spirits you've killed and absorbed, all those thousands of years ago. Some of them were my friends, you know."

"Don't be like that, Selkram," Arraka says, with a mocking tone. "We're friends too, aren't we? After all, it's thanks to me that you found out you could absorb other spirits. Don't think that I didn't figure out what you've been doing. You might have managed to hide this from all the other spirits in the magical plane, but I'm the one who invented the technique! I know all about its side-effects. Your voice started to change right after we had our first battle, in the magical plane, and the same thing happened to Ulruk. Those different voices that you are using when you speak are from all the other spirits that you couldn't absorb properly, aren't they? The same thing happened to me, at first, but then I learned, and I adapted, unlike you idiots. Seriously, what did you and Ulruk think? That you could just copy my technique without any sort of training? Just how arrogant could you be, anyway? Do you have any idea how much time I spent perfecting that spell? But hey, I guess it was easier for you to assume that only female spirits from the civilized races could absorb other spirits correctly, and to convince everyone to banish us to the earthen plane, than to admit that the only reason for your failure was your outstanding ineptitude."

 "I will not stand here and listen to you mocking--" the God of Time starts to say, but Arraka cuts him off.

"You both should have listened to Memphir," Arraka says. "He's the only one with a brain out of all you 'gods'. I bet he tried to stop you from absorbing the spirits, didn't he? I never heard HIM using different voices when he spoke. How is Memphir, by the way? Isn't the time limit for his own prophecy due at some point during this century?"

"The God of Fate and his prophecy are none of your busin--" the God of Time starts to say, but he gets cut off yet again.

 "Yeah, it was this century, wasn't it?..." Arraka says, as she is now ignoring the God of Time completely, while getting lost in her own thoughts. "And the prophecy was pretty specific about his death too. It said that he would get killed by a member of the civilized races from the earthen plane, who would originate from a region called Varathia. I remember how Memphir kept rechecking that prophecy again and again, in the hopes that something would change, even if he always got the exact same result. He was becoming completely obsessed with it... I bet he must have really freaked out when Eiden named this continent Varathia, huh? And now that the time limit is drawing closer, the so-called 'God of Fate' even went as far as forming a temporary alliance with the 'God of Death', saying that he'd help him with his indiscriminate murders, as long as they were being focused on Varathia! I honestly don't get what's going through Memphir's head. If I were in his place, I'd just reduce this entire continent to a pile of ashes in one day, and be done with it!"

 The God of Fate is aiming to destroy this continent too? Just how could this situation get any worse?...

"Arraka, if you don't keep quiet, I'm going to--" Selkram, the God of Time says.

"You're going to what?..." Arraka says, in a provocative tone. "Destroy my amulet?"

"I could also throw you very far away from here, in the middle of an ocean, where nobody will ever find you again," the god says.

"I'd like to see you try," Arraka says.

"Don't listen to her provocations!" Illuna says, as she is struggling to articulate her words, while she is still being pushed face-first against the ground. "If you throw her in an ocean, she will just escape from her amulet by herself, and then it will be the end for all of us!"

"Oh?" the God of Time says. "So you must be her captor, then... Or maybe just her jailor. I suppose it is only fitting for a 'banshee' to be the one overseeing such a task, given how much your kind has had to suffer because of her arrogance."

 "And because of yours!" Flower shouts, all of a sudden. "It's your fault that Petal has to live like this! She never wanted this life. She never wanted to kill anyone. And neither did any of the other banshees. I will never forgive you for what you've done!"

"You will never forgive me?..." the God of Time says, sounding genuinely puzzled. "You must have a very short memory, if you can afford to talk to me like this, after all that has happened. Allow me to refresh that short memory of yours, a little."

He then begins to increase the pressure that was pushing Flower against the ground, until she starts screaming in pain. After a few more seconds, the God of Time reverses time once again, to make sure that he doesn't kill her by accident, and he continues to squash her, over and over again, like before. 

"Oh, no..." Arraka says. "Not the time reversals again... Just kill me and put me out of my misery!"

 "Is this really how a god should act?" I say, as I try hard to turn my face towards the God of Time, while I'm still being pushed against the ground. "Picking on little girls? Do they not have the concept of honor in the magical plane? Or at least dignity?"

The god reverses the time again, in order to heal Flower, and then he floats all the way to my position, so he can get a better look at me. Or at least I think that's what he's trying to do, since he doesn't really have a face.

"How curious..." the God of Time says. "You seem to be weak, even by mortal standards. I can sense almost no magic in your aura. And yet you still try to defy me. Why is that?"

"You can't use reason to understand that one's motivations," Arraka says. "He even tried to attack me with a dagger once, when I was at full power. I think his survival instincts are defective, or something. He's just a weakling, anyway, so who cares?"

 "It's not just him, who is surprisingly weak, however..." Selkram says, as he flies to a higher position, in order to have a better look at all of us. "Neither of the people in this group, except for the stillwater girl, can even begin to compare with the ones from six hundred years ago, in terms of magical power. Last time, there was the golden fox, there was that stillwater you were fused with, and there was also the really strong stillwater who was travelling with the fox. Eiden, I believe was his name? Compare that to what we have here, and it all seems like a cruel joke. Why even bother to send the time weaver to any of these people? They will probably just get killed off within the next couple of days, if they are lucky enough to even survive that long..."

"What are you... Ngh... talking about?" I say, as I'm having a little trouble speaking properly, due to my face being constantly pushed in the dirt. "Aren't you the one who sent the time weaver here?"

"Hah!" Arraka says. "Selkram WISHES he could just control time weavers whenever he wants! The Magium is the one who sent the time weaver here, not this sad excuse for a god."

"The Magium?..." I say, too shocked to be able to do anything other than repeat her words.

 "Mhm..." Arraka says. "It is somewhat of a tradition for the Magium to send a time weaver on the earthen plane, every time there is the potential for a great number of lives to be lost in a short period of time. Especially when it comes to this continent. When the time weaver's powers finally awaken, the person who was gifted with these powers will enter some kind of trance, they will freeze time, and then they will walk patiently towards several groups of people, delivering the prophecy to them, one by one. That's how it's always been."

"But then... what does the God of Time have to do with all of this?" I ask.

"Oh, Selkram is just hijacking the signal, so to speak," Arraka says. "He found a way, long ago, to take advantage of a time weaver's trance to temporarily link himself directly to the Magium, and he is using this connection to insert a ritual of his own into the mix. You know how the other gods get their power through large numbers of followers? Well, Selkram doesn't have any followers. He's going for quality over quantity. Basically, since the groups visited by time weavers have the potential to affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, he decided to channel all of his efforts into exploiting people like you, instead of begging for the adoration of a bunch of sheep, like all the other gods are doing."

"What... kind of ritual are you talking about?" I ask Arraka, a little apprehensively.

"Well, I don't really know all the details," Arraka says, "since these rituals of his always change, but there should almost certainly be some time-travelling involved, in at least one of the stages. When's the ritual starting, anyway?"

 I decide to avoid trying to piss off the God of Death even further. I would probably only make things worse for all of us if I intervened.

"Leave her alone!!!" Kate shouts, after Selkram squashes Flower against the ground a few more times. "Haven't you hurt her enough?!"

The god reverses the time again, in order to heal Flower, and then he floats all the way to Kate's position, so he can get a better look at her. Or at least I think that's what he's trying to do, since he doesn't really have a face.

"Very strange..." the God of Time says. "With the tone you are using to address me, I would have expected you to at least have some decent amount of magical energy, to back up your threats. But when I look at you closely, I see that your power can barely even compare to the stillwater in your own group, let alone someone of my caliber. So, why is it that you are trying to defy me, I wonder?"

 After he stops talking, the God of Time releases Rose from his grasp, and then he waves his hand in front of her face, which causes the bright light to fade from her eyes.

"What's going on?..." Rose asks. "How did I get here?"

"You will have your questions answered in due time," the God of Time says. "For now, all you need to know is that you will soon be participating in a godly ritual, and that the only way to make it out of there with your sanity intact will be to pass the trials that you will be facing.

He pauses.

Arraka laughs.

"I think you will be very surprised of their upcoming performance," she says. "These aren't the types to give up easily."

"We shall see about that soon enough..." the God of Time says.

He then flies over to Rose's position, and he grabs her by her chin, turning her head left and right a few times, while bringing his face closer to hers.

"Get your hands off her, you bastard!" Flower shouts, from the ground, while she is trying, in vain, to force her way back up.

"You want me to get my hands off her?..." the god asks, surprised. "Oh, this time weaver is your friend... How interesting.

 I then get a strong dizziness sensation, while it feels as if my mind is being pulled straight out of my body. As soon as the light disappears and I can see around me again, I notice that I'm still lying on the ground, but everyone else is gone. 

Wait, no, that isn't right... It's not that everyone else is gone. It's that I've been transported to an entirely different place. I am still in the middle of a forest, somewhere, but this forest seems awfully familiar. As if I've been here before, in my distant past.

When I decide to get up and explore a bit, I am momentarily frozen in shock, as I realize that my height is now considerably lower than it was before. And it's not only my height, that's different, either. My arms are also much shorter, my hands are smaller, and I'm no longer wearing the same clothes.

"--these rituals of his always change, but there should almost certainly be some time-travelling involved," I hear Arraka's voice in the back of my head, as I suddenly remember what she was saying to me earlier. 

Time-travelling, a smaller body, and a familiar-looking forest. I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

I immediately check my pockets, to see if I still have any of my old items, but they are all gone, including my stat device. If this is really the forest I think it is, and if that strong, magical aura I'm feeling in the distance also belongs to whom I think it does, then the God of Time must have sent me back to when I was around thirteen years of age. But for what purpose?...

 I throw all those thoughts away, and I start running as fast as I can, towards the house that I once used to call my home. I say that I'm running towards my house, but truth be told, my home used to be more of a cabin, really. It was made almost entirely of wood, and it was somewhat isolated from the rest of the village, because my father liked the quiet. We had a river close to us, and we could get all the firewood we needed from this forest, so we were somewhat independent of the other town folk. We even had a small patch of land, that we were farming, and a barn, where we kept our hay. It's funny how I can still remember all of these details so vividly, when I haven't thought about this place in many years.

As soon as I reach the edge of the forest, I take a look towards the old cabin, and my heart skips a beat, when I see my little sister in the middle of our front yard, just as the banshee within her is awakening, and preparing to take over her body. That powerful magical aura radiating from her is just as sinister as I remembered, and it's sending shivers down my spine. Not only is my sister's aura changing, but her body is also transforming into something that could no longer be called human. Her face looks like it's melting, and her skin is turning purple, while the rest of her body is getting slowly deformed.

 As the donkey in front of our barn is making loud and scared noises, my parents and my little brother are just coming back to the house, and they're rushing towards the yard, to see what is happening to my sister. They're still alive... My parents are still alive. This time I didn't arrive too late. I can still save them. I can make things right. I can-- wait... what about that trial the God of Time was talking about? Is saving my parents part of the trial, or am I supposed to be doing something else?

No... To hell with that trial! I'm being offered a once in a lifetime opportunity to fix my past mistakes. I'm not going to throw it away. This time, I won't be too late. This time, I'm going to save them all.

 I couldn't ask for a better moment to attack the banshee. With her awakening still ongoing, she should be too busy to pay attention to anything else around her. Now is the time to strike.

I quickly rush inside our barn, while the donkey is still hee-hawing, and I grab the pitchfork that was lying on the ground. Do I really want to kill the banshee, though? It's not really her fault that she's forced to kill other people, in order to continue living. Maybe if I try to reason with her... No, no, no, remember that laugh. Remember that sinister laughter that still sometimes haunts me in my dreams even after so many years have passed. This banshee killed my parents in cold blood, and she enjoyed it. She is not like Illuna. You can't reason with her. It's either kill, or be killed.

As I am approaching the banshee, I see that my parents and my brother have already reached her, and they are trying to talk with her, as if she were still my sister.

"Claire!" my mother says. "Dear gods, what happened to you?"

"We need to call a doctor!" my father says, in a panicked voice. "Or... a magician. The kind that Barry is always talking about. A mage! That's what they're called. This looks like some sort of magical illness. If we can find a mage doctor, maybe we can--"

"Step aside, father..." I tell him, as I get closer to them, with my pitchfork still in my hands.

 "Barry..." my father says. "What are you doing with that pitchfork? Your sister is very ill! We need to get her to a doctor."

"What she has is not curable," I tell him. "I need to kill her, before she kills us all."

"Barry, what are you saying?!" my mother says, shocked. "There has to be a way to save her. You can't just kill her, like this. She is your sister!"

"What you see there is no longer my sister," I say. "She is a banshee. Let me pass."

"I don't care what she is," my father says, with a determined look on his face, as he places himself between me and the banshee. "I'm not letting you harm my little girl."

"There's no time to be having this argument," I say. "We need to kill her quick, before she--"

I don't get to finish my sentence, because the banshee has just completed her awakening, and she made full use of our distraction to run her hand through my father's chest, from behind, impaling him as if she'd used a spear.

"No!!!" I shout, as my father falls to the ground, gurgling up blood.

I then try to dash towards the banshee with my pitchfork, but she was waiting for me. All she needed to do was conjure a sharp lance made of stone, out of thin air, and she sent it flying straight through my skull, killing me before I even had the chance to reach her.

Your sister is very ill! Do you know of any mage doctors in our area?"

"There are no white mages in any of the villages around our area," I tell him, as I slowly approach him with the pitchfork in my hand. "And even if there were, it would be too late for her."

"What are you saying?..." my father says. "And what are you doing with that pitchfork?"

 "Never mind the pitchfork," I say. "Don't take your eyes off Claire. In a matter of seconds, she's going to turn into a monster, and she won't hesitate to attack you."

"Claire? A monster?..." my father says, as he turns towards her, apprehensively. "No, that can't be what's really happening... You are joking, aren't you, Barry?"

"Don't take your eyes off her," I tell him again, with a serious tone in my voice. "If she tries to kill you, I won't hold back against her."

Just as I was done talking, the banshee was already finished with her awakening, and she was preparing for her first strike. I quickly push my father out of the way with one hand, and with the other, I keep hold of my pitchfork. The banshee was trying to impale my father with her bare hand, but due to my intervention, she only managed to lightly wound me in the left side of my abdomen, instead.

My mother gasps, as she sees the blood, dripping out of me.

"Barry!" she shouts, with fear in her voice.

I do not give the banshee the time to attack me again, and I run my pitchfork straight through her chest, while holding the weapon with both my hands. The banshee screams in a very loud and shrieky voice, but she doesn't manage to muster the strength for another strike, and after a few more seconds, her screams and her squirming all come to an end, along with her life.

 As I drop the pitchfork from my hands, along with the banshee's body, my mother comes to hug me tightly, and then she just holds me in her arms for a few seconds, without saying anything.

"Thank you..." my mother says. "Thank you so much for saving him. I can't even imagine how it would have been to lose both my daughter and my husband in the same day."

She then retracts all of a sudden, as she takes a look at my wound.

"I'm sorry," she says. "I shouldn't have been pressing on your wound like that. I'll go get some bandages and some rubbing alcohol from the house. It looks like it's only a surface-level wound, so it should be enough to clean it up a little. I'll be right back!"

She then rushes towards the house, as my father is still apparently in a state of shock from what happened, and my brother is crying in the background.

My thought process gets interrupted by an extreme dizziness, as the entire area gets flooded with a bright white light again.

No... It can't be...

My magical sense is enough to give me all the information I need. The aura of the banshee possessing my sister is just as strong as it was the first time I was sent back in time. I can also sense that my parents and my little brother have not reached our house yet. I can sense it all. So why am I running?...

As soon as I reach the edge of the forest, and look towards our house, I see my sister turning into a banshee, just like before. Everything I did was for nothing. It's going to happen again. And I'm the only one who can stop it from happening.

 I run as fast as I can towards the barn, and I grab the pitchfork from the ground, just like the last time. Without even thinking, I make a sprint towards the banshee, and before my parents and brother can reach her, I impale her through the chest.

This has to be it. I did everything perfectly this time around. I didn't get wounded, I didn't interact with either of my parents, and I killed the banshee before she even had the chance to complete her awakening. This has to be what the ritual wants from me, right? Otherwise, why would it have sent me here?

"Barry..." my mother says, with tears in her eyes. "What have you done?"

When I look at the ground, to see the corpse of the banshee I killed, I notice, to my shock, that her body has reverted to the original form that my sister had, before the awakening began. As my mother grabs the lifeless corpse of my sister tightly in her arms, my father is looking at me with nothing but contempt in his eyes, as a silent fury is slowly taking over him.
	
"You killed her..." my father says. "You killed her in cold blood. You little bastard. Is this how you repay us for taking you in? For treating you as if you were our own son?"

"Jonathan, that's enough!" my mother says, with a sudden, panicked look in her eyes.

 "No, Helen," my father says, with the same dark look on his face as before, while he is not letting me out of his sight. "The boy needs to know. I WANT him to know. Barry... I want you to remember what I'm about to tell you, for every single day that you'll be spending rotting away in prison. You are NOT our son. You never were. Your real parents were a couple of outsiders who moved into our remote village less than a year before you were born. They were both murdered in broad daylight, a few years later, by some hooded thugs that somehow managed to then vanish without a trace, and since there was no one left to care for you, Helen and I decided to take you in. But we only did it out of pity, and because nobody else wanted you. Do you understand?! Nobody wanted you! Nobody wanted--"

The last words of my father's sentence were completely drowned out by the sound of my mother slapping him very hard across the face.

"I said that's enough!" my mother says, as she looks at him with a determined look on her face, while she wipes a tear from her eyes.

 As I stand there and try to decide upon my next course of action, a dark thought suddenly crosses my mind, regarding a scenario that I've completely avoided to take into consideration until this moment. What if this ritual isn't about me saving my parents? What if the only reason why the God of Time sent me here was to force me to relive my past mistakes, and to show me how powerless I am to change them? Arraka did mention that these rituals are meant to exploit us for the god's own benefit. And after all that the God of Time has done to us, it just wouldn't make sense for him to help us change our past, out of the kindness of his heart.

The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. It's not like the 'God of Time' is an actual god. He didn't create time. He doesn't have any control over it. The only way to undo something that has already happened is through a time reversal spell. If my parents' deaths have not been undone through magic, then my presence here is irrelevant. I will just be forced to repeat these same events, over and over, until I take the exact same actions that I took when I was thirteen years of age. There was never any other option. I was a fool to think otherwise.

I slowly begin to step back inside the forest, while I'm trying hard to maintain my calm. There is no other way. I only need to get through this one more time, and then it will be over.

 I stop a few dozen feet away from the edge of the woods, and I wait there for my parents to try talking to the banshee. I can't let either of them spot me. I need to do everything just like I did it fifteen years ago. I need to arrive late.

When I start hearing the screams of my parents, as they are being murdered, I get the sudden urge to get out there and save them, but I manage to restrain myself. There is nothing I can do to help them. I need to stay strong.

As soon as I stop hearing their voices, I rush out of the forest as fast as I can, and into the barn, to grab the pitchfork. My brother is now running away from the banshee, just like I remember he did, all those years ago. While she is busy chasing my brother, the banshee is an easy target. I quickly circle around her, and I run my pitchfork right through her stomach, from behind. The banshee tries to turn around, and to attack me, but she is too weakened, due to her awakening. Eventually, she stops moving, and she drops to the ground, as I let go of my pitchfork, so it can fall along with her.

 As I look towards my parents' corpses, lying close to the banshee, I cannot help but feel a sharp pain in my chest area, around my heart, although it passes soon afterwards. This is the second time I've failed to save them. No... I can't think like this. My parents were already dead. This was no different from a dream. A terrible dream that is now finally over--

A bright white light suddenly engulfs me, as my consciousness is yet again being transferred to a different body. When the light and my dizziness fade away, I once more find myself in the same forest, while my sister's aura can be felt very clearly, in the distance.

 She then heads towards me, and she puts her hands on my shoulders, as she looks me straight in the eyes.

"Barry, I'm really sorry about what your father said..." my mother tells me, while she is still trying to hold back her tears from before. "I'm sure he didn't mean to say all those terrible things. It must have been the shock of what happened, that made him lose his temper. It's not true that we didn't want you. We've always loved you, even if you weren't our real son."

She then pauses for a second, to wipe the tears forming in her eyes with her sleeve.

 "And regarding your sister..." my mother continues. "I can't bring myself to believe that you killed her without a reason. We all could feel the powerful and unnatural magical aura coming from your sister just minutes ago, and we could see from a distance what monstrous form she'd taken, before you killed her. I... don't know anything about magic, and neither does your father. But you were always fascinated by it, and always took every opportunity you had to learn more about it. If that thing your sister was turning into was dangerous enough that you had to kill her, I am willing to trust your word on it, no matter how painful it would be for me to accept it. But you have to give me your word. You have to swear to me that there was no other way. Barry, can you swear this to me?"

"Yes, I swear!" I say. "There's no way I would have--"

It's no use. I can't talk anymore. The dizziness has overwhelmed me yet again, and I can feel myself being pulled out of my body, while the bright light blinds me just like the last two times. Once the dizziness and the light are both gone, I find myself in the exact same spot that I am now all too familiar with, while my sister's aura can be clearly felt beyond the edge of the forest, as strong as ever.

 No... I can't let it end like this. Not when I'm so close to saving them. Even after all that my father just said to me, I still can't bring myself to hate him. He saw me brutally murder his little girl in front of his eyes, after all. And my mother was willing to trust me, even under these conditions. I can't give up on them just like that. I'm going to find a way to save them, no matter what happens.

I spent the next hour or so, trying to figure out what could be going wrong with what I was doing. I tried everything I could think of. I killed the banshee with different weapons, I killed her before and after my parents intervened, I tried to reason with the banshee before killing her, and I even got my father to kill her by himself one time.

All for nothing. Every single time when it seemed like it would finally work, I would just get sent back in time again, and I would have to start over from scratch. I almost died a few times as well. I'm not sure how this ritual would work if I died, but given how little interest the God of Time seemed to show for our lives, I would not be surprised if I would simply stay dead, without any sort of time reversal to save me.

 As I stand there and try to decide upon my next course of action, a dark thought suddenly crosses my mind, regarding a scenario that I've completely avoided to take into consideration until this moment.

 No... No!!! How can this be? I didn't do anything different from fifteen years ago. I let both my parents die. I saved my brother. I used the same pitchfork. I even made sure to arrive too late, so that there wouldn't be any doubt that I did... exactly...

No... That's not right. That is not at all what happened... That's just the story that I've been telling everyone for the past fifteen years. I've been telling it for so long, that I've even managed to fool myself into believing it was real. But the reality of these events was in fact far different from what I remembered. Now I understand what this ritual wants from me. Now I finally get what I need to do.

As the realization of what really happened all those years ago finally dawns upon me, I first experience a feeling of shock, then, a feeling of resignation, and finally, a feeling of hatred. A feeling of pure hatred towards the God of Time, which only keeps intensifying as I walk through the forest.

When I finally reach the edge of the woods, I go inside the barn to pick up the pitchfork, and then I head towards my parents, who were now trying in vain to talk with the being that was once my sister. I position myself at a safe distance from my parents, and I wait.

 After a few more seconds, the banshee finally awakens, and she tries to impale my father with her bare hand. Amazingly, my father manages to dodge her first attack, so the banshee attacks him a second time, by driving a sharp cone of rock through his leg, making him fall on the ground, as he screams in pain. The banshee is now screaming as well, seemingly because she is also in pain, as a result of straining herself so hard, immediately after her awakening. While the banshee is distracted, my father finally notices me, and he also sees the pitchfork that I am holding in my hands.

"Barry..." my father says. "Quick... Throw me the pitchfork!"

I say nothing to my father, and I continue to stare at him, while I keep cursing the God of Time in my mind, more and more, with each passing second.

"Barry!" my father says, this time in a more desperate tone. "There's no time! You need to give me the pitchfork!"

Unfortunately for him, the banshee had already recovered, and she was preparing for a third, and final attack. My father could not do anything to escape, due to the large wound in his leg, and he was impaled once more, this time through his chest, which killed him almost instantly.

 My mother screams in terror, as she sees my father die before her eyes. She is now much too scared to move, but before her dying moments, she manages to utter a few last words.

"Barry, please... save me..." she says.

Just like before, I do not move from my spot, I do not answer her, and the banshee kills her by slitting her throat, with a dagger made of sharpened rock. When the banshee sees me just standing there, looking at my parents' corpses, she begins to laugh. The exact same sinister laughter that I remember clearly to this day. And now I finally know what she was laughing about. She wasn't laughing because she enjoyed killing my parents. She was laughing at me.

It wasn't that I arrived too late. That was never what happened. I was there when my parents were being attacked. I saw it all happen before my eyes. I had the pitchfork in my hands, ready to strike, but when I got closer to the banshee, and saw her monstrous figure staring at me with that vicious look in her eyes, I simply froze. I completely froze, in fear, and I couldn't even hear my father and mother begging me to help them. It was only when my little brother was almost about to get killed by the banshee as well, that I finally mustered up the courage to attack her. That is what really happened, fifteen years ago, and what I've completely blocked from my mind for more than half of my life.

 "It looks like you are one of the first to pass this part of the ritual, Barry-boy," Arraka says. "Come, have a seat, and let us enjoy ourselves, while we watch the rest of your friends suffering in their own trials!"

I take a quick glance around me to see what our current situation is. The God of Time is no longer anywhere to be seen, but it doesn't seem like his departure affected the ritual in any way. Daren, Kate, Leila, Hadrik and the revenant appear to be in some form of trance, similar to the one in which the revenant was when she first arrived to this place. Their eyes are bright yellow, and they're just staring in front of themselves, without being aware of our presence. All of them are standing in place right where I left them, except for the revenant, who now has her feet on the ground, instead of floating in mid-air like before. In the meantime, Melindra, Illuna, and presumably Flower are all out of their trances, and they're looking at me attentively.

 "What do you mean you want us to watch my friends during their trials?..." I ask Arraka, once I get a good grasp of our situation. "You have a way to see what's happening in the past?"

"Sure," Arraka says. "It's not that hard. They're all connected to the Magium, right now, so if you know how to link yourself up to their auras properly, you should be able to see what they are seeing."

"The Magium..." I say, as I suddenly remember the discussion that Arraka had with the God of Time before he sent us back in time. "You were saying before that the Magium is the one that sent the revenant here to give us the prophecy. What did you mean by that? Are you saying that the Magium is a person?"

"Ahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "Illuna did you hear? He asked me if the Magium is a person!"

"I heard him..." Illuna says, in a dry tone, as Arraka continues to laugh in the background.

"Of course you wouldn't answer my question..." I say, as I look towards Arraka's amulet. "Never mind the Magium, then. What can you tell me about the others' rituals?"

 This was the one and only time when I ever froze up from fear. In fact, if I come to think of it, what happened after this incident was that I developed an almost suicidal tendency to completely ignore danger, no matter how dire the situation was. It's almost as if my desire for something like this to never happen again was so strong, that it fried my brain, and it eliminated my instinct of self-preservation. So many things are starting to make sense, now... I can't believe that I've been keeping this memory repressed for so long. I suppose I have the God of Time to thank for this stunning revelation. I would shake his hand, but with the amount of rage that I am feeling towards him right now, I'm afraid that I might crush it by mistake.

The banshee is now starting to chase after my brother. I waste no time, and I dash towards her, impaling her through her back with my pitchfork, without giving her any chance to retaliate. As the banshee slowly dies before my eyes, a white light once again fills the area, and I get transported through time once more. This time, however, I am not worried. I already know that I have passed this stage of the ritual.

Just as I was expecting, as soon as the light fades, I find myself back in my twenty-eight year old body, surrounded by all my friends, as Arraka lets out one of her usual laughs.

"She could have died..." I hear Daren's voice reverberating from the walls, even though Daren's mouth is still closed. "She could have died right before my eyes, and I would have been powerless to save her..."

"No, you idiot!" Arraka says. "How many times do I need to tell you that your friends are connected to the Magium, right now? Reading their thoughts while they are in this state is easy if you have some decent knowledge of how auras work. Now shut up and pay attention! I didn't bring you here for nothing."

 "The ones that are still inside their rituals, obviously."

"Hmm..." Arraka says. "I think it would be quicker to show you directly. Let's start with the healer."

In a single instant, the scenery around me changes completely, and everyone except for Flower and me disappears from before my eyes, as I now find myself standing in front of Rose's house, in the city of Thilias. When I take a better look at the two of us, I notice that Flower and I have both become semi-transparent, and the same goes for Arraka's amulet. On the other hand, I'm also seeing another Flower and another instance of me who are not transparent at all, and who are currently busy talking to Rose and her siblings, in the same yard where we are located. Hadrik, Kate and Daren are also here, apparently, but they are not saying anything.

}
#if(v_b2_ch11_both == 0 || v_b2_ch11_both == 1) {
 "First, let me give you a bit of context!" Arraka says.

"What's happening?" I say. "How did you bring us here?"

"Shh..." Arraka tells me.

"Rose," I hear Daren saying. "Could you show me to my room? All I want right now is to lie down in a bed for a while."

"Certainly!" Rose says. "Follow me, I'll show you the way!"

"Okay, now the healer is heading towards his room, and he's going to stay there for a while," Arraka says. "Remember this part?"

"Yes," I say. "This happened right after we reached Rose's house for the first time. But why are you showing me this? Does this have anything to do with Daren's ritual?"

"I told you," Arraka says. "I'm trying to give you some context! It wouldn't be any fun otherwise. Alright, next up, we'll fast-forward to Daren's room."

Once again, the whole scenery around us changes in an instant, and we both find ourselves inside Daren's room from Rose's mansion, where Daren is currently sitting on the bed, with his torso leaning forward, and his elbows propped on his knees, while he is holding his head with both his hands. Just like before, he seems to be completely unaware of our presence.

 "He can't see or hear us, by the way," Arraka tells me, as we are still in our semi-transparent form. "Just thought I'd make it clear, in case you didn't figure it out by now."

"She's dead..." I hear Daren's voice reverberating from the walls, even though Daren's mouth is still closed. "She was killed right in front of my eyes, and I was powerless to stop it all from happening."

"What was that?" I ask Arraka, as I look all around us, to try and find the source of the sound. "Were those... Daren's thoughts?"

"Of course they were his thoughts," Arraka says. "What else could they have been?"

"You have the ability to read people's minds?" I say, starting to panic a little.

"No, you idiot!" Arraka says. "How many times do I need to tell you that your friends are connected to the Magium, right now?

 "No..." I hear Daren's voice echoing throughout the room again. "It's not that I was powerless. I could have gotten the power, if I wanted it. But would I have gotten it?... Would I have been able to do something as humiliating as asking Eiden for help, for the sake of saving that poor girl's life? What would have happened if Barry hadn't intervened? Would that girl have been dead because of me? Because I couldn't let go of my ego? No! Eiden is evil. He couldn't have just offered to help me without having an ulterior motive. But then, why didn't he ask for anything in return? I saw him give Barry the power, and there were no tricks. He even gave the rest of us the power as a side-effect of his spell... So, then, why did he do it? What could have been his reason? Did he really give me that option just to humiliate me? What is Eiden thinking?..."

"Perfect," Arraka says. "I think this should be enough context for our intents and purposes. Let's move on to the ritual."

Again, the environment around us changes completely, but this time, we find ourselves on the streets of Thilias, right as the noble was threatening Ella. Flower and I are still semi-transparent, but the non-transparent version of me is standing about a dozen feet away from our current position, and so are Daren, Kate, Rose and Eiden.

 "What do you mean you won't interfere?" Daren says, with an anxious tone in his voice. "You're still going to give Barry the power to attack the noble, right?"

"Is that what I did the last time you experienced these events?" Eiden asks, with a wicked smile. "Why was it Barry that saved the slave instead of you? Is it because you refused my offer? Yes, that would make sense, wouldn't it? But this time, you won't be able to rely on your friend to clean up your mess anymore. So, what are you going to do?"

"This bastard..." I hear Daren thinking. "I should have known he couldn't be trusted. But if Barry isn't going to save Ella anymore, then that means..."

Suddenly, we hear Ella screaming in fear, as the earl of Ollendor is now holding his knife in his hand, while approaching her slowly.

"Please, I beg you!" Ella says, as she is desperately trying to lift all of the luggage that she was supposed to carry, in her hands. "Give me one more chance. I can still carry these bags for you. I don't want to die!"

"Then you should have thought of that before wasting my time, wench," the noble says. "Now stand still. I will make your death as swift as possible."

}
#if(v_ch11_saved_slave == 3) {
 "No..." I hear Daren's voice echoing throughout the room again. "It's not that I was powerless. I could have gotten the power, if I wanted it. But I didn't ask for it. I was too proud. I was too arrogant. I thought that I could find a way to save her, against all odds, like I always do. I couldn't accept the idea that I could fail, to such an extent. Even when the noble pulled out the knife, I still refused to see the truth before my eyes. I let that poor innocent girl die, because I couldn't bring myself to beg Eiden for help. Even if he is evil, his motives were clear. All that he was asking in return for the power was for me to admit my weakness in front of him. Nothing more. And I couldn't even do such a simple thing. Not only that, but I also killed that noble and endangered us all, just for the sake of pointless revenge. Why couldn't I have killed that noble before he murdered the girl in cold blood? What use are all these years of training and travelling throughout the world, if I can't even save one helpless girl that is standing right in front of me?"

"Perfect," Arraka says. "I think this should be enough context for our intents and purposes. Let's move on to the ritual."

Again, the environment around us changes completely, but this time, we find ourselves on the streets of Thilias, right as the noble was threatening the slave girl. Flower and I are still semi-transparent, but the non-transparent version of me is standing about a dozen feet away from our current position, and so are Daren, Kate, Rose and Eiden.

 "What do you mean you won't interfere?" Daren says, with an anxious tone in his voice.

"You know exactly what I mean, healer," Eiden says, with a wicked smile. "I'm talking about the offer that I surely must have made to you the last time you experienced these events. And what I'm saying to you is that the offer is no longer valid. So, what are you going to do?"

"This bastard..." I hear Daren thinking. "I should have known he couldn't be trusted. But if he's not going to offer me the power anymore, then that means..."

Suddenly, we hear the slave girl screaming in fear, as the earl of Ollendor is now holding his knife in his hand, while approaching her slowly.

"Please, I beg you!" the slave girl says, as she is desperately trying to lift all of the luggage that she was supposed to carry, in her hands. "Give me one more chance. I can still carry these bags for you. I don't want to die!"

"Then you should have thought of that before wasting my time, wench," the noble says. "Now stand still. I will make your death as swift as possible."

 "Okay," Arraka tells me. "This is where Daren's ritual actually started. What I've been showing you so far were just fragments of his memories, so you could better understand his motivations. Is everything clear, so far?"

"I guess so..." I say.

"Good," Arraka says. "Now let's watch the show."

"What happened?" I hear Daren's thoughts, echoing throughout the area, as he looks around him confused. "Is this the ritual that Arraka was talking about? Did I get sent to the past?"

"How interesting..." Eiden says, all of a sudden. "The flow of the healer's aura has changed completely, in a matter of seconds. It's as if he's now a different person from the one he was a few moments ago. What could trigger such a change, I wonder... Memory loss? No, no, no... This is something else. Time travel, perhaps? A trial from the God of Time?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," Daren says, trying to feign ignorance. "Who is this God of Time you speak of? I've never heard of him."

"So you did receive a trial, then!" Eiden says, with a grin, as he sees right through Daren's bluff. "But what could be the purpose of the ritual?... Is it to save the slave girl? Either way, I must make sure to not interfere. I would not want you to fail your trial on my account!"

 Without thinking, Daren rushes to Ella's aid, and he tries to pull her away from the earl.

"Come, Ella," Daren says, as he tries to pull her by the arm. "I'm taking you away from this monster."

"No!" Ella shouts, as she panics, and jumps back from Daren. "I can't! I can't run away from him. I am his property."

She then turns back to face the earl of Ollendor.

"Sir, please, I promise you that--"

Ella does not get to finish her sentence, because the noble immediately slits her throat wide open with a single slash of his dagger.

"No!" Daren shouts, in desperation, as he immediately grabs Ella in his arms, and he attempts to cast a healing spell on her.

Unfortunately, by the time his spell began to take effect, Ella had lost way too much blood, and she slowly died in his arms, while he was still trying to heal her.

"Pfft..." the noble says, as he looks at Daren in disgust. "How pathetic."

 "No, this wasn't supposed to happen!" Daren shouts, completely ignoring the earl, as he is still trying to heal the dead Ella that he is holding in his arms. "It wasn't supposed to be like this. She was supposed to keep living, happily, at Rose's house. She deserved to be happy! Please... If anyone's listening. Give me another chance. I promise I won't fail her again, next time. Please..."

He then starts to sob, quietly, as he continues to hold Ella's corpse tightly in his arms. After a few seconds of silence, except for Daren's slow sobs, a bright white light suddenly envelops the area, and then, a few moments later, we find ourselves in the same area again, but with Ella still alive, and with Daren back where he was when he was first sent back in time.

"Ahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "Did you see that? Did you see how well-timed that was? Even if it were all staged, it couldn't have turned out as good as this!"

 "Just what is it, exactly, that you are finding so funny?"

"You mean, aside from all the suffering?" Arraka says. "Well, it's the fact that the oaf is now going to believe that he was actually given another chance, like he asked. But in reality, neither the ritual, nor the God of Time could give less of a damn about whether he saves the slave or not."

"So you're saying that's not what his trial is about, then?" I say.

"Of course it isn't!" Arraka says. "What kind of a stupid question is that? Didn't you go through a trial yourself only a short while ago? You should already know what the healer needs to do to pass this test."

While Arraka and I were talking, Eiden was just discovering for a second time that Daren had been sent to the past, by the God of Time, and he was now getting ready to mock him once again.

 "I must make sure to not interfere," I hear Eiden say. "I would not want you to fail your trial on my account!"

"No, you don't understand!" Daren says, with obvious desperation in his voice. "I need you to interfere! I can't fail her again! I need the power that only you can give. The power to attack the noble!"

"Oh?" Eiden asks, surprised. "I honestly wouldn't have expected you to ask me for help so directly. But even so, there is no use in undergoing a trial if you are not going to solve your problems by yourself. I'm afraid that I'll have to decline your request, regardless of what I may have done in your original timeline."

"Damn you!" Daren says. "Do you want me to beg? Is that what you want?"

"No, actually I was--" Eiden starts to say, but he interrupts himself when he sees Daren drop to his hands and knees in front of him, with his head bowed down.

 "Then I will beg!" Daren says. "I will beg on my hands and knees. Even though I hate you with all of my heart. Even though I consider you to be one of the most evil and irredeemable people I've ever met. But right now, you are my only hope to save this girl from her terrible fate, and the only thing I can do is to beg for your help. So please... I'm begging you... Give me the power to save this girl, and I will do anything you ask, no matter how humiliating it may be..."

While Daren was talking, I could see Eiden slowly opening his eyes, for a few seconds, with an expression of both shock and amazement on his face. Then, when Daren finished his speech, Eiden smiled, slightly, with his eyes closed.

"You will do anything I ask, you say?" Eiden says. "Then I have only one request."

He pauses, for a second, as he gets a much more serious expression on his face.

"Prove me wrong..." Eiden continues.

The stillwater then raises his hands, and a powerful wind starts spinning around him for a few seconds.

"You have the power, healer," Eiden says. "Now go, go! Before it's too late!"

"Right..." Daren says, as he gets up from the ground, and rushes towards the noble.

"How many second chances are you going to ask me for, foolish girl?" I heard the earl of Ollendor say, with his knife in his hand, while Daren and Eiden were still having their conversation. "Do you not realize that my mercy isn't without limits? I've had enough of your excuses. This time I will kill you for good. Don't you dare move from that spot!"

"I won't let you kill her, you bastard!" Daren shouts, as he rushes towards the noble, with his sword at the ready.

"What the hell?" the earl says, just as he was about to slit Ella's throat, and he turns to look towards Daren.

The noble barely has the time to turn around, because Daren's blade beheads him in an instant, and the earl of Ollendor's headless corpse soon falls to the ground, next to its severed head.

"Aha- Ahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "The idiot actually thought he completed the trial! Can you believe that? And the irony is that all he needed to do for his trial to be complete was to just calm the hell down, and to shut his mouth. That way, Eiden wouldn't have seen any unusual changes in his aura, and he wouldn't have been able to guess that the God of Time sent him back in time. But at this rate, it's going to take him a million years to figure it out! Oh man, this guy is such a good source of comedy!"

"Is his ritual the same as mine, then?" I ask her. "He just needs to recreate the same events that happened the very first time?"

"Is his ritual the same as mine, then?" I ask her. "He needs to recreate the same events that happened the very first time, in order to succeed?"

"Yes, most of your rituals were made in the same way," Arraka says. "If he wants to pass the trial, the first thing he'll need to do is to calm the hell down, because otherwise Eiden will always be able to tell that something is wrong, from seeing the sudden fluctuations in his aura. Then he'll need to refuse Eiden's offer once again, and to try to convince the noble of his errant ways, which will eventually lead to the slave's death.

 As I look around me, I see that our environment has changed completely, in a matter of seconds, and we are now situated in the middle of a very dark underground corridor, with only a few dimly lit torches, to provide us with any light. Almost immediately after we arrive in this place, we can hear the scream of a young boy, echoing somewhere in the distance, and then we hear a little girl, screaming in pain as well, although she appears to be somewhere closer than the boy. Not long afterwards, we start to hear the terrified screams of a few other children, as well. Some of them are begging for mercy, some of them are trying to suppress their screams, and others are calling in vain for their parents to save them.

I've heard the stories about this place from both Kate and Leila, but I never would have imagined it to be as bad as this. Just standing here and listening to all these screams is giving me goose bumps all over my body. I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like to experience what those children are going through right now.

 "Wow, these lessathi sure weren't messing around, huh?" Arraka says. "It's like a whole symphony of horrified screams down here. Anyway, this isn't exactly where I wanted to bring you. I'm just gonna need to take a quick look and see what your friend Kate has been doing since the beginning of this ritual, so I can spare you the boring details, and get right to the good stuff. I'll just leave you to enjoy these melodious sounds of pure agony, while I do my thing, okay?"

"Melodious sounds of-- These are children that are screaming, here!" I shout at her. "What the hell is wrong with you?!"

"To be perfectly honest, I couldn't care less about the screaming children," Arraka says. "It's the psychological kind of torture that I usually tend to find amusing, not the physical one. That's why the real entertaining part for me is to see YOUR reactions to all of this. Why else did you think I went through the trouble of bringing you with me to these rituals, if not for my own entertainment?"

 "I thought you were just bored, and decided to bring me along on a whim."

"Nah," Arraka says. "That's Eiden's shtick, not mine. I know it may not seem like it, most of the time, but I rarely do things without a reason. For example, I specifically chose this moment in time as our initial destination, because I knew they were going to be doing experiments at this hour, and there would be a lot of screaming going on. It just would have felt like a waste if I kept you waiting in a silent, empty hallway, you know?"

"Ugh..." I say. "Just shut up and get us out of here, already."

"Easier said than done," Arraka says. "I may be a genius when it comes to magic, but you still can't expect me to comb through all of these events that have been happening here in a matter of seconds. It's not like I get to connect myself to the Magium like this on a daily basis."

"You keep casually talking to me about the Magium, but you haven't even told me what it is, yet!" I say.

"That's the joke, Barry-boy," Arraka says. "I keep doing it because I know it frustrates you. It's a good way to keep myself from dying of boredom, while I go through the tedious process of scanning these memories."

"Can you at least tell me how you are able to switch between past and future with so much ease?" I ask her. "And how is it that you can also access people's memories, and transport us into them as if they were a part of our reality?"

 "When you're linked directly to the Magium in the way we are now," Arraka says, "terms like 'past', 'future', 'memories', and 'reality' become irrelevant. In here, everything is both real and imaginary at the same time. Allow me to demonstrate!"

A giant, red serpent, with two wings, and four small claws suddenly appears in front of me, and it immediately flies towards me, with a menacing look in its eyes, while its whole body is surrounded by flames. I panic a little, and I jump back, trying to pull my dagger out, but the monster scratches my right leg with one of its claws, and then it disappears just as quickly as it made its appearance.

"Arraka, what did you do?" Flower asks, shocked, as Illuna approaches me, in order to heal me.

"Relax!" Arraka says. "Neither of us can die in here. That scratch right now didn't hurt, did it?"

"Now that you mention it, I suppose it didn't," I say, as Illuna suddenly stops healing my wound, realizing that I was never in any real danger.

"That's because these aren't our real bodies," Arraka says. "They're just our projections. Our real bodies are still right where we left them, stuck in one of those weird trances with the glowy eyes. What I was trying to show you was that I can do whatever I want, while we're in here. It's like my own playground. Obviously, I can't interfere with what your friends are doing, since we don't really exist in their worlds, but as far as spectating goes, my options are unlimited."

 "So, you're saying that my friends can't die either?" I say. "They're just in an imaginary world, right now?"

"No, this only applies to us, because we are projections, like I said," Arraka tells me. "The worlds that your friends have been transported into are very much real. It's just that they're not OUR world. They are parallel worlds, similar to ours, in which the future never actually happened. Obviously, none of the changes that they make in those worlds will affect our world in the slightest, but they have no way of knowing that. Didn't you find it strange that you managed to pass your own ritual even if it should normally have been impossible for you to perfectly reproduce the exact actions you took fifteen years ago, down to the last detail? That's because it wasn't the laws of time preventing you from doing what you wanted. It was just Selkram, messing with your head."

"The God of Time..." I say, as I am suddenly filled with uncontrollable hatred, just by uttering his name. "Is he watching us, right now?"

 "I still don't understand how you can find entertainment in such things..."

"Hey, cut me some slack, alright?" Arraka says. "I might have been normal too, if I hadn't witnessed my parents being brutally murdered in front of my eyes, when I was only a child..."

"Really?..." I say.

"No, not really, you imbecile!" Arraka says. "Banshees don't have parents. What are you, Flower?"

"Ugh..." I say. "Just shut up and get us out of here, already."

 "No," Arraka says. "He can't just stay materialized in our world for as long as he wants. That would waste too much energy. That's why he usually only comes in at the very beginning, and at the end, unless it is absolutely necessary for him to personally intervene in the middle of a ritual. Otherwise, he'll mostly just stay in the magical plane, and wait patiently for the rituals to gather energy for him."

"But how do these rituals help him?" I say. "What is it about these trials that give him so much power?"

"He's gathering energy from your negative emotions," Arraka says. "Hatred, anger, fear, despair... that kind of stuff. Those are the types of emotions that can be exploited in the most efficient way, through these methods. But he can't really do any of that without linking himself directly to the Magium, during the time weaver prophecies, so he needs to squeeze as much as he can out of you guys, while he still has the chance. That's why these trials are designed the way they are. To make sure that they trigger as many strong negative emotions out of you as they can."

"I'm not sure if I like where this is going," I say. "Just what kind of messed up trial is this guy trying to put Kate through, if he needed to send her all the way back to her years at the Beacon?"

"We will both see in a few seconds," Arraka says. "I never actually looked at this ritual before I came here with you, so we'll both be experiencing this for the first time, together. I'm sure it will be fun. Let us begin!"

 We both disappear from the corridor with all the screaming, and we reappear in a dark, empty room where an eleven year old version of Kate seems to be talking with what I'm assuming is a twelve year old version of her friend, Diane. Kate is easy to recognize, because she just looks like a smaller version of her usual self, but Diane has long, blond hair, and a much more frail physique than she had, in her adult form, so it's a bit more difficult for me to tell if it's really her or not. They are both dressed in rags. The room we are in resembles my old holding cell from the arena, with one bed and a small window on top, so I'm guessing that they are most likely in Diane's room, and Kate decided to pay her a visit, in order to tell her something that she knows from the future.

"I didn't manage to make her thoughts audible, so we're going to have to work with what we have," Arraka tells me. "Let's see where this goes."

"I'm telling you, it's not the test of loyalty!" Kate tells Diane, while whispering, in order to make sure that the guards outside don't hear them. "I know that it's hard to believe, but I've come from the future, and I know that the lessathi caretaker who is trying to help us escape will become Leila's adoptive father later on. I know that he can be trusted!"
