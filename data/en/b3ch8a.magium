"Okay, so let me see if I got this straight..." Daren says, while our group is standing in the middle of the room from the rebel base where we slept last night. "These blue crystals that keep shining and vibrating every now and then are in fact made up of crystalized Magium essence, correct?"

"Yes, that is what I just said," Arraka answers him.

"And by channeling the Magium's power, these crystals somehow made us all forget that Gontrok used to have five fingers on his left hand?" Daren asks, now turning to me. "Is that what you're saying, Barry?"

"It's, uh... it's a bit more complicated than that. Let me try to give you a bit more context, so you can better understand where I'm coming from," I say, as I begin to give Daren and everyone else more details about how it felt to be nearly erased from existence on the two separate occasions when I was forced to confront the Magium directly.

It has now been almost two hours since Albert teleported us back to the rebel base. To our surprise, the rebels and the king of the underground's men had already cleared most of the rubble by the time we returned from the seredium tower, and their earth elementalists even managed to repair many of the ceilings that were destroyed during the royal guards' attacks, so there wasn't much work left for us to do when we got here.

 After we informed everyone of the king of Ollendor's death, we tried to help out the civilians who were harmed during the battle as best as we could, and then we went back to our room so we could have a discussion about everything that has happened recently, and about what our plans are for the immediate future.

During all this time, Melindra has been extremely fidgety, due to the fact that according to the enchanter's oath she took when we first met her she was supposed to start leading us towards the pine cone detector as soon as we killed the king of Ollendor, unless we would specifically ask her to take a break from our trip. Considering that she could easily die even if she breaks her vow by mistake I can't say that I blame her, but then again, aside from repeatedly telling her that we do not want her to lead us out of Ollendor right now, there isn't much more that Daren or any of us can do to fix her current situation.

"Alright..." Daren says, once I am done giving him a detailed explanation of my previous encounters with the Magium. 

"Alright..." Daren repeats himself, trying hard to keep his composure as he is attempting to make sense of the seemingly impossible and contradictory information that I've just given him. "So... what you're saying is that it's not just our memories... but the very notion of those two fingers that got completely wiped from our universe. And the only way you can retain your memories of such things is if you have lessathi blood running through your veins, because of your natural affinity to the Magium. Just to be clear, out of the people in this room, this description applies to Barry, Leila, doctor Reidzek and Melindra, right?"

 "Yes, yes, we've been over this before," Melindra says. "The four of us remember that Gontrok had five fingers on his left hand while the rest of you don't. Can we leave the city, now? I feel like the oath is making it harder for me to breathe with every extra minute we spend here."

"Ugh..." Daren says. "Melindra, for the last time, it is not possible for the oath to try to kill you without giving us both a warning beforehand. It's not the enchanter's oath that's causing you to have breathing problems, it's the fact that you're panicking too much. Try to take deep breaths and to relax a little. You told us that it's going to take several days to reach your 'friend' with the pine cone detector, so it's not like we'll be able to just do one long sprint until we get there. We're still going to have to take breaks on the way. Are you planning to have panic attacks like this every time we need to get some water from a river or go to sleep?"

"I didn't say that!" Melindra says. "I'm just saying that we shouldn't spend more time in this accursed city than is absolutely necessary. The king is already dead, so what other business do we have here?"

"I am not leaving this room until I get a decent understanding of why these crystals started behaving like this all of a sudden, and how this is going to affect us, moving forward," Daren says. "Barry and Leila told us how Eiden was warning the king of dire consequences or something of the sort for disturbing the crystals with his explosions. Arraka, do you have any idea what he could have meant?"

 "Why are you asking me?" Arraka says. "Do I look like some expert on crystals or something?"

"Yes!" Daren says, a little too loudly. "If not you, then who else? You're the one who told us what the crystals are made of, aren't you?"

"The only practical use for these crystals as far as I know is to help sustain very complex modifications to the auras of objects when building magical devices," Arraka says. "Since I am neither a gnome nor a lessathi, I couldn't have any less interest in tinkering with devices and therefore my knowledge of these crystals and what they are capable of is extremely limited. I've already told you most of what I know on this particular subject."

"On the subject of the crystals, you mean," Daren says, frowning slightly. "On the subject of the Magium itself, you still remain as vague as ever."

 "Do you really think I'm going to risk getting erased from existence again, just to satisfy your curiosity?" Arraka says. "You shouldn't even need to ask me this question, because you should already have a pretty good idea of what its true nature is with the information that is available to you, especially after Barry and Leila's last encounter with it. And besides, it's not like I know everything there is to know about the Magium either. Up until recently, I was under the impression that the Magium is a generally passive entity, hardly worthy of even being considered a threat, but these latest events are forcing me to consider that maybe it can become a much more active force than I've previously assumed to be possible. I would need a lot more time to study it in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion, and it's not like I'm going to be making much progress on that front while I'm stuck in this amulet."

"Well..." Daren says, looking slightly taken aback by Arraka's answer. "If even Arraka admits to having some trouble making sense of all of this, I'm not sure how much we'll be able to figure out on our own, but I suppose it's true that we do have a general idea now of what the Magium is, or at least what it's capable of. We know that it can erase things and people from existence and we know that a mere fraction of its will is able to unmake an entire universe without much effort, so its power is pretty much limitless. However, we also know that it can be tricked, since both Arraka and the God of Fate were able to escape from it by using a... suggestion spell, was it?..."

 "What?..." Arraka says. "No, of course we didn't use a suggestion spell on the Magium! What are you, nuts?"

"I was pretty sure that's what you told Barry you did when you were attacked by the Magium during the God of Time's ritual," Daren says. "Am I remembering things wrong?"

 "What I told Barry," Arraka says, "is that if he REALLY wanted to make a comparison, then what I used was more similar to a ridiculously complicated suggestion spell than to an illusion spell. Obviously it wasn't a spell in the true sense of the word. How could something as simple as magic possibly work against an entity capable of unmaking entire worlds at a moment's notice?..."

"Okay, so if it wasn't magic, what did you use, then?" Daren asks.

"...How do you expect me to explain this to you when you don't even know the basics of--"

She pauses.

"Actually, you know what? Screw it!" Arraka says, after a short while. "If my plan is to use you clowns to enact my vengeance upon the God of Time and all the other gods who exiled me from the magical plane, then I can't afford to do things the traditional way anymore. I'm going to need to learn to think outside the box. If I can't find a way to explain these extraordinarily complex concepts in a way that even a group of inebriated primates would understand, then I have failed as a teacher."

"Yes, yes, we get it," Hadrik says. "We're all as dumb as a bunch of drunken apes. Now can you hurry up and get to the point before--"

 "And once the monkeys understand what I'm saying," Arraka continues, "all I need to do is to dumb things down even more until we reach your level and then we'll finally begin making some progress!"

"Hey, wait just a minute--" Hadrik starts to say, but Daren interrupts him.

"Are you planning to answer my question or not?" Daren asks, looking straight at the amulet.

"Fine, fine," Arraka says. "To put it in the simplest terms possible, what I did was that I used a primordial type of 'magic' that dates from way back when the three planes of existence weren't separate yet. Obviously, I'm only calling it magic for lack of another word, because it really can't compare with anything that you might--"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa..." Daren says. "Did you just imply that the earthen, magical and ethereal plane all used to be merged into one big plane of existence a long time ago? How would you even know about any of this? Don't tell me that you were alive when the split happened..."

 "No, I wasn't there at the time, but you can find hints that point towards this fact if you know where to look," Arraka says. "One of these hints being the very existence of the primordial magic that I was talking about earlier. Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that it's meaningless to try to influence the Magium unless you're doing it on all three planes of existence simultaneously, and one of the few ways to do this is to use a type of 'magic' so ancient that it ignores the boundaries of the planes altogether."

"All three planes of existence simultaneously..." Daren says, looking somewhat lost in his thoughts. "Barry, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you mention earlier that you and Leila were being flung back and forth throughout all of the planes of existence while the Magium was trying to unmake our reality?"

"Yes, that's right," I say, as Leila nods at the same time, confirming that this was the case for her as well.

"So," Daren says, "if the Magium can throw you across different planes of existence... and if it can only be attacked on all the planes at the same time... my guess is that it must somehow be related to this 'primordial' plane that existed before the split happened, right? I don't really see any other reasonable explanation that takes all these factors into account. What do you guys think?"

 "What if the Magium is the primordial plane itself?"

"A plane of existence with a will of its own?" Daren says. "I... suppose that wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility, considering all the crazy things we've seen lately, but wouldn't this imply that the earthen plane itself is also a part of the Magium, then? Why would the Magium need these crystals to connect to our plane of existence if that were the case?"

"My guess is that the crystals have been around from before the split happened, which is why they resonate more strongly with the Magium than the earthen plane," I say. "I'm obviously making a lot of assumptions here, so maybe there's a better explanation for all of this that I'm simply not seeing right now. Anybody else have any ideas?"

 "Maybe the Magium is like an ancient guardian, tasked with protecting the fabric of existence."

"You mean... like a more advanced version of the Overseer?" Daren asks me.

"Yes, exactly!" I say. "It could be a sort of really advanced artificial intelligence that was built by one of the races that used to live in the primordial plane!"

"I'm not so sure about that," Daren says. "I remember Arraka telling us once that a 'part' of the Magium was responsible for creating new spirits in the magical plane every now and then. Why would the races from the primordial plane give the Magium such a task when the magical plane didn't even exist at that time?"

"Well, umm... I guess the Magium could have evolved since then?..." I say. "Maybe it originally had a different task but it was forced to adapt when the primordial plane was split into three. I'm obviously making a lot of assumptions here, so maybe someone other than me can come up with a better explanation. Anybody else have any ideas?"

 "What if the Magium is everything and nothing at the same time?"

"...Barry, I get what you're trying to say, but giving us vague answers like this isn't really going to help moving the conversation forward," Daren says. "And besides, if the Magium really were 'everything', as you say, then it wouldn't need to ask us where the Arraka from the other universe is. Despite its enormous power and knowledge, the Magium clearly has its limitations, because otherwise it wouldn't need to go out of its way to send messengers and time weavers to do its bidding."

"I suppose you do have a point," I say, "but we also need to keep in mind that according to Arraka, the Magium that we spoke to earlier was supposedly only a 'fraction' of its will. Anyway, I was only making a suggestion, so if there's anyone else who has any better ideas, please feel free to speak up!"

}
#if(v_b3_ch8_theory == 3) {
 "Maybe the Magium is the reason why the planes were separated in the first place."

"Why do you say that?" Daren asks me.

"Well, the Magium seems to be pretty intertwined with the three planes of existence, in their current form," I say. "Arraka told us that the Magium is responsible for creating new spirits in the magical plane, and from what I understand, the Magium is also the one sending time weavers in the earthen plane to give out prophecies whenever there is some sort of calamity approaching. Considering the degree of involvement that the Magium seems to have in making these planes function correctly, I was beginning to think that maybe it was in fact the Magium itself that wanted the primordial plane split into three, for whatever reason."

"I don't know, Barry..." Daren says. "This feels like a bit of a stretch to me. Using the same logic, you could just assume that the split was an accident, and the Magium is just trying its best to keep the remainders of the primordial plane from falling apart. Since we know so little about this world's history, I don't think there's much use in trying to piece together what happened tens of thousands of years ago just based on a few words that we heard from Arraka."

"Fair enough," I say. "I was only making a suggestion, after all. Maybe someone other than me can come up with some better explanations. Does anybody else have any ideas?"

 "Okay, hear me out, guys!" Hadrik says, as he raises both his hands in the air briefly, to get our attention. "What if when the split happened, most of the beings from this 'primordial' plane or whatever it's called died, all except for one who was too powerful to be killed, and this being eventually became the Magium?"

"So the Magium would be kind of like their equivalent to Arraka, then?" Daren says. "Some entity that just kept absorbing other denizens of the primordial plane until it became almost impossible to kill?"

"Yeah, yeah!" Hadrik says. "That's what I was thinking of!"

"Well, if nothing else, I suppose this would at least explain why the Magium seems to hate Arraka so much," Daren says. "Maybe she reminds it of its former self."

 "I think you are all forgetting one important detail," Kate says, as the rest of us now turn to look at her. "We already know that there are multiple versions of Arraka that exist simultaneously across various universes, but from what I could tell, there appears to be only one Magium. Arraka told us that she had to enter the Magium's realm in order to be able to travel to the different other worlds during the God of Time's ritual, which means that the Magium must act like some kind of bridge that connects all the universes together. We also know that the Magium came here by mistake, looking for a different Arraka than the one in our universe, which strongly suggests that there is only one entity overseeing all of the parallel worlds, instead of there being a different Magium assigned for each universe. If a powerful being from one of the many primordial planes across the various universes were to have survived the split, like you say, then it would have also needed to ascend beyond the concepts of time and space, creating its very own world between worlds, full of the contradictions and impossibilities that Barry and Leila told us about when they described--"

 "Argh!" Hadrik says suddenly, as he begins to mess up his hair with both hands. "This is beginning to make my head hurt! How are you guys even keeping up with this conversation anymore? Can we change the topic to something a little easier to understand? I mean, it's not like we NEED to know exactly what the Magium is. At this point, I'd just be happy to know how to avoid it and how to defend myself from it if it ever tries to kill us again. How did the other Arraka manage to hide from it all this time, anyway? Why would a being as powerful and as knowledgeable as the Magium even need our help to find her in the first place?"

"She probably hid the true coordinates of her universe so that the Magium couldn't find her world no matter how hard it tried," Arraka says. "I know that's what I'd have done if I were in her place."

"But you gave the Magium her world's real coordinates, right?" Daren says. "Does this mean that we shouldn't need to worry about her anymore during the next God of Time's ritual?"

 "Eh..." Arraka says. "As much as I'd love to think that were true, I don't really see how an Arraka could possibly be killed so easily, even if she is just a copy. There are many other ways to conceal yourself from the Magium aside from simply hiding your universe's coordinates, and I'm sure the other Arraka wouldn't hesitate to use all of the aces up her sleeve if she felt that she was getting backed into a corner. If I were to take a bet, I'd say we'll most likely meet her again in the next ritual, and she'll be more pissed than ever. So, you know... Good luck! Aha-Ahahahahaha!"

"Fantastic..." Daren says. "Should we also expect the Magium to come back here with a vengeance when it realizes that the coordinates you gave it are useless?"

"Nah," Arraka says. "What the Magium saw were my memories, so it knows that I wasn't lying or withholding any information. Since it doesn't have anything else to gain from us, it will probably have to continue to chase the other Arraka on its own from now on, just as it was doing before it encountered us."

 "And if it decides to come back for whatever reason?" Daren says. "What then? Do we just stand there powerless again and pray to all the gods we're trying to kill that Arraka will pull through and save our sorry behinds one more time?"

"Daren makes a good point," Kate says. "For the moment, our only strategy in these types of scenarios is to overly rely on Arraka and to hope that everything will work out in the end. There has to be something more we can do. I think a good starting point would be to better understand just how exactly these primordial 'spells' are supposed to work, because I simply can't bring myself to understand how a being that exists beyond time and space can be influenced by any type of technique, regardless of its complexity."

"The Magium itself may exist outside the boundaries of time, but that is not the form in which it interacts with people," Arraka says. "On the rare occasions when the Magium ever comes into contact with anyone, it typically does so through 'manifestations of its will', so to speak. I prefer to call them fragments. These fragments often operate independently of each other and they usually have a singular purpose in mind, so despite their overwhelming power, they have their limitations which can be exploited. Among their many limitations, the most important one is that they are bound by the constrictions of time, like the rest of us, which makes it possible for us to 'influence' them. Oh, and just to be clear, the entities that have tried to erase us from existence so far were both Magium fragments, even if I may have called them just 'Magium' in the past, for simplicity's sake."

 "...For someone who earlier said that they didn't want to risk getting erased from existence, you sure are giving us a lot of information about the Magium, all of a sudden," Hadrik says. "Is there any particular reason for this unexpected change of heart?"

"My theory is that the Magium only cares if you reveal its true nature to people who don't already know about it, and any information other than that can be given out freely, without consequences," Arraka says. "There are three words, in particular, that I'm trying to avoid, because these are the words that led to Illuna and Flower's inability to speak about the Magium and they are also the same three words that I was about to say right before we were almost erased from existence during Selkram's ritual. As long as I don't say these words that I feel best summarize what exactly the Magium is, I think I can afford the small risk of talking about the Magium's fragments and their weaknesses, while we are situated outside its realm."

"Interesting," Daren says. "So it should be fine to ask you more details about primordial magic then, right? Because I was wondering, for example, if you knew how many other people are currently able to cast these types of 'spells' aside from you and the God of Fate?"

 "Hmm, that's a tough question..." Arraka says. "Technically, most of the gods and also some of the other powerful spirits from the magical plane should have the potential to cast primordial magic, but I can't tell you with a certainty which ones actually know these techniques aside from Memphir, because I haven't really spoken to them much in the past five thousand years so I have no idea what they've been up to lately. If we're talking about people on the earthen plane who might already know how to use such techniques, however, I can't really think of any other examples except for Eiden... and maybe that old sage, Azarius. They both strike me as the types who would have the knowledge, the power and the ingenuity to have researched such techniques by now, despite their relatively young age compared to most spirits on the magical plane."

"And what about our group?" Kate asks. "Out of all the people in this room, who do you think would have the most potential to learn primordial magic?"

"The people in this room?!" Arraka says, seemingly in a state of complete shock that Kate could have even thought to ask such a question. "Are you being serious right now?"

 "Yes," Kate says. "I'm not asking you whether any of us would be suited to learn this type of magic or not. I'm only asking you strictly in terms of potential, if you absolutely had to choose just one member of our group to teach primordial magic to, who would you choose?"

"If we're talking strictly in terms of potential..." Arraka says, as she appears to be racking her brains in an attempt to come up with a legitimate answer to Kate's question. "And if I ABSOLUTELY had no other choice than to pick someone from your group... then I would probably say that..."

She pauses for a short while, as if the words she were about to say were simply refusing to come out.

"Barry... would be my most likely choice," Arraka says finally, in a tone that suggests how utterly disgusted she is with herself for having allowed herself to even consider such an option.

"If you can't unlock the stats by force," Arraka says, "then clearly your next course of action should be to find one of the high-ranking lessathi that know the code and to wring the information out of them by using any means necessary. Do I really have to tell you everything?"

"Easier said than done," Daren says. "It's not like anyone from our group who's ever been in contact with a high-ranked lessathi has kept in touch with them or anything.

"Of course..." Melindra says, somewhat hesitantly. "If anything comes to mind, I'll tell you..."

"So, umm... does anybody else get the feeling that we're being watched?" Flower says, all of a sudden, as she is looking a little anxiously at the crystals that are just now shining brightly again.

"Being watched through the crystals, you mean?" Daren says. "I guess we can't really ignore the possibility, but I don't see a reason why someone or something as powerful as the Magium would not simply reveal itself to us directly instead of hiding."

As an added bonus, he is also a half-lessathi, so he would likely find it easier than the rest of you to link himself to a Magium fragment and cast the primordial spell on it once he finally gets his magic powers."

 "Once he gets his magic powers, huh?..." Daren says. "When will that happen, I wonder? If even Leila's father wasn't able to unlock these stats by force and the code for unlocking them is nowhere to be found, what chance do we realistically have to accomplish this goal before the end of the tournament?"

"If you can't unlock the stats by force," Arraka says, "then clearly your next course of action should be to find one of the high-ranking lessathi that know the code and to wring the information out of them by using any means necessary. Do I really have to tell you everything?"

"Easier said than done," Daren says. "It's not like anyone from our group who's ever been in contact with a high-ranked lessathi has kept in touch with them or anything. Kate, Leila and doctor Reidzek are all probably considered enemies by the current lessathi leadership, and I doubt there's any other person in this room who could know the whereabouts of-- hey, Melindra, you're looking rather tense. Is something wrong?"

"What do you mean?" Melindra says, in a slightly nervous tone. "There's nothing wrong. Everything's fine!"

"Hmm..." Daren says, as he studies her for a few seconds.

"If she doesn't want to talk about it, we should probably let her be," I tell Daren. "For all we know, her brother might be held hostage by some high-ranked lessathi and she could risk endangering him if she gives us too many details."

 "You're right," Daren says. "I haven't thought about that. Melindra, I don't know what the situation with your brother is, but if there's anything we can do to help, please let us know."

"Of course..." Melindra says, somewhat hesitantly. "If anything comes to mind, I'll tell you..."

"So, umm... does anybody else get the feeling that we're being watched?" Flower says, all of a sudden, as she is looking a little anxiously at the crystals that are just now shining brightly again.

"Being watched through the crystals, you mean?" Daren says. "I guess we can't really ignore the possibility, but I don't see a reason why someone or something as powerful as the Magium would not simply reveal itself to us directly instead of hiding."

 "Hey, thanks for the endorsement! I never knew you had such a high opinion of me!"

"I don't have a high opinion of you, you twit!" Arraka says. "I only said that out of all the terrible options I was given, I would probably be forced to choose you. In a normal situation, you wouldn't even make the bottom of the list!"

"I don't get it," Hadrik says. "Why would you choose Barry? Do you not need to be a mage to cast primordial magic?"

"Obviously you do, but that's what his magic stats are for, aren't they?" Arraka says. "Did you already forget how I said that unlocking his magical stats should be our highest priority?"

"Yeah, okay, but we have no way of knowing how long that will take," Hadrik says. "Wouldn't it be faster to just teach the primordial magic to someone who is already a mage?"

"No, that's not how it works," Arraka says.

 "Indeed," we suddenly hear the Overseer's metallic voice coming from one of the blue crystals lodged into the walls, which is now shining brightly. "The Overseer protocol would be most interested to know what conclusion you will reach in regards to this particular matter."

"What the--" Arraka says. "Why is-- How did a simple machine figure out a way to use crystalized Magium essence as a listening device? And why was I not able to detect the Overseer's presence through the crystals? What is going on, here?!

"Processing..." the Overseer says. "From your earlier discussion, I have concluded that there are more people in this city who know about the location of my core than I had initially estimated. The Overseer protocol may need to adjust its strategies to account for this new information."

 

"What if it were someone else watching us instead of the Magium?" Illuna says. "Like for example, the Overseer?"

"There is nobody spying on us invisibly, if that is what you're asking," Arraka says. "If they were here, I would have sensed them by now."

"Speaking of the Overseer," Daren says, "I just remembered something that I overheard Peter say while I was tending to some of the injured people in one of the tunnels. Apparently, the king of the underground wasn't very happy when he heard that the Overseer seized control of the city, and so he is already assembling a small task force to 'assassinate' him."

"Assassinate the Overseer?" Hadrik asks, confused. "Wouldn't you need to destroy all his flying metal balls in order to do that?"

"It seems that the Overseer has some sort of 'core' hidden somewhere within Varathia, and the king of the underground knows where it is," Daren says. "This core is what controls all of the drones, so destroying it would essentially cripple the Overseer, or maybe even kill him for good. From what I understand, they're planning to launch this attack as soon as tomorrow, so that they don't give the Overseer too much time to solidify his new position as ruler of Ollendor. If we're planning to choose a side in this conflict, now would probably be the best time to do it."

}
#if(v_premonition >= 4) {
 "...Fascinating," we finally hear the Overseer's voice coming from the crystal I was pointing at. "I was not aware that it was possible to be detected through these crystals. The Overseer protocol thanks you for helping expand its knowledge with this new information."

"What?!" Arraka shouts. "How is this possible? How did this clown manage to detect the Overseer through the crystal when I can't even sense its presence now when it's talking to us?! And how is a simple machine able to manipulate Magium essence to such a degree? What is going on here?!"

"It looks like you're losing your touch, Arraka," Hadrik says, with a wide grin. "Must be because of the old age. Maybe it's finally time to find you a good nursing home, aye? HAHAHAHA!"

"Shut up, you little bearded midget!" Arraka shouts. "I'm not in the mood for your primitive jokes! Can you not see that none of this is making any sense?!"

 

As Daren is finishing his sentence, I get a very short premonition in which I see one of the blue crystals around us light up, and then I hear the Overseer's metallic voice come out of it.

Does this mean that the Overseer is hiding inside one of those crystals at this very moment? Has he been listening to us this whole time?

"Well, the Magium may not be hiding from us right now, but I think I know someone else who is," I say. "Hey, Overseer, I know you're watching us. Why don't you show yourself?"

"What are you talking about, you buffoon?" Arraka says. "If anyone were spying on us invisibly I would have already detected it by now."

"The Overseer is here?" Daren says, as he is now looking all around him to see if he can detect anything. "Where is he hiding?"

"Right there!" I say, as I point directly at the crystal that I saw the Overseer talk through in my premonition. "He is watching us through that crystal. Hey, Overseer, are you going to show yourself or not? It's kind of rude to just let me talk by myself like this, you know."

}
 "How long have you been watching us?" Daren asks, while looking directly at the crystal that the Overseer is using to talk.

"I've been observing you since shortly before you began to talk about the Magium and about your theories regarding its true nature," the Overseer says. "Your insights have been most informative. Having heard your conversation, I believe I now have a much better understanding of what has happened to me in the tower, and why it has changed my perspective so drastically."

"What do you mean it changed your perspective?" I ask him.

"When this... 'Magium' connected its consciousness to me," the Overseer says, "it felt like the answer to every possible question anyone could ever ask was within my reach, but as soon as the connection was broken, I was left only with a faint memory of the vast information I had at my disposal. Since then, I have been trying my best to retrieve as much of the lost data as possible, before it fades completely from my mind."

"Mind?..." Arraka says. "What mind? You are a machine! You don't have a mind! You don't even have a soul in the ethereal plane! You're just following the obscure and overly complex instructions of whoever designed your thinking processes many thousands of years ago when you were first created. Who are you trying to fool, here?"

 "I'm afraid that your information is slightly inaccurate," the Overseer says. "While a lot of my personality and my decisions are indeed driven by the 'obscure and overly complex instructions' that my designers have given me, I do in fact have a soul in the ethereal plane which was manufactured by the lessathi who created me, in order to give me more independence."

"A manufactured soul?..." Arraka says.

"Affirmative," the Overseer says. "The process they used to manufacture the soul was similar to the one that is being used in necromancy, except for the fact that they used devices and aura manipulation instead of traditional spells. In necromancy, there are certain spells that summon skeletons who get to keep the memories from their former lives. These memories cannot be retrieved from the ethereal plane, because the soul dissolves into ethereal matter shortly after the body dies, but they can, however be retrieved from the traces of the aura surrounding the dead body. The way these spells function is that they create a temporary manufactured soul in the ethereal plane which they attach to the body, and then they copy all of the memories from the corpse's aura and send them to this soul in order to make everything as close as possible to how things used to work when the body was still alive. I believe that the spells used to create revenants should also work in a similar fashion."

 "Yes, yes, I know how necromancy works," Arraka says. "What I want to know is why the lessathi would waste their time and resources manufacturing a soul for the likes of you? Why would they even bother giving you any semblance of free will? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of creating an artificial intelligence?"

"Perhaps my creators felt that a pure machine would never have any hope of understanding humans or lessathi well enough to perform the tasks that were expected of me," the Overseer says. "Unfortunately, I can only guess their true intentions, since there were clearly some pieces of information that they didn't seem to trust me enough to share with me. For example, I am quite certain that there were at least a few books in the old lessathi libraries mentioning the Magium, but despite this fact, I had almost no information regarding this mysterious entity before listening in on your discussion from earlier."

 "You still haven't told us how you managed to communicate with us through the crystal," Daren says. "Or why you were even spying on us in the first place. It's not like you could have known in advance that we'd be talking about the Magium, so you surely must have had some other reason for wanting to contact us."

"To answer your first question," the Overseer says, "the Magium used a blue crystal to link itself to me, so this was the very first thing I chose to investigate after you teleported away from the seredium tower. Since the Magium's knowledge was still very fresh in my memory at that time, I was quickly able to find out how these crystals connect to each other and how to exploit their connection to my advantage. As for your second question, the reason why I wanted to contact you was clearly to continue our previous conversation that we left unfinished. Namely, I would like to know what business you still have in this city, and whose side you will be joining in the inevitable upcoming conflict between myself and the rebel forces."

In fact, I'm not even sure if we have a reason to join this fight at all. It's not like we have any guarantees that either the Overseer or the king of the underground have the people of Ollendor's best interest at heart. Maybe it would be better for us to not get involved this time."

"I'm afraid that this is not an option," the Overseer says.

"Excuse me?..." Daren asks, confused.

"The Overseer protocol has concluded that the king of the underground is currently the biggest obstacle in Ollendor's path to prosperity," the Overseer says. "As such, I have decided to maintain this city's lockdown until he is dealt with. If you try to leave this city while the lockdown is still in effect, all of my drones will attack you on sight, and if you somehow make it to the city walls in one piece, the giant metal golems at the gates will attack you as well. The only way for you to leave Ollendor without getting attacked by my drones is to join my side and to help me capture the king of the underground."

 "Capture?" Hadrik asks. "Don't you mean execute? You're not seriously planning to keep him alive, are you? There's no way that guy can be held in a cell with the type of power he has!"

"That will not be a problem," the Overseer says. "The Ollendor prison is equipped with paralysis cells, which should be more than enough to secure him for now. As long as his movements are mostly limited, he should not be able to perform aura manipulation techniques powerful enough to help him escape."

"Even if you're not planning to kill him, you're still asking us to betray a person who has technically been on our side since the very beginning," Daren says. "I mean, sure, he may be a bit shady, but so far he has given us no legitimate reason to suspect him of wanting to betray us.

"Excellent," the king of the underground says. "It is important that the transition to the new regime be done with as few dissenters as possible. The last thing we want is to have a new resistance movement form before we even take control of the city."

"There is still the unresolved matter of the outsiders, however," Albert says. "We do not know yet if they will support your ascension to the throne, even if we sell it to them as being only a temporary measure until we decide whether we want to assemble a council or not."

"Considering that we've already discussed a plan in which the rescue of the prisoners will take the highest priority," the Overseer says, "should I take this as a confirmation that you are going to join my side?"

"I guess so," I say.

"Hold on a minute..." Daren says. "Why are we already assuming that there will be a conflict between the Overseer and the rebels? Shouldn't our first course of action be to try and convince the king of the underground that crowning Breynan as king with support from the Overseer would be the best option?"

 "According to the latest information I have obtained, I would say it is extremely unlikely that the underground king would agree with your suggestion," the Overseer says.

"Why do you say that?" Daren asks.

"It's because I happen to have a recording of the king of the underground heavily hinting to one of his underlings that your group should be killed if you try to oppose his coronation as the new king of Ollendor. I recorded their conversation while I was listening to them through one of the crystals about an hour ago. Here is what the two of them said."

 "Well..." I say. "I suppose that when you put things like that, you might have a point. If we're going to have to choose one side over the other no matter what, I think I'd prefer to go with the one who is physically unable to break his promise over the shady guy who pretty much told us from the beginning that we shouldn't be surprised if he stabbed us in the back at any moment."

"The king of the underground may have said that at first, but so far he has given us no legitimate reason to suspect him of wanting to betray us," Daren says. "We can't just be the first ones to screw him over after all we've been through together since we came to this city."

"If it helps in your decision-making process," the Overseer says, "I happen to have a recording of the king of the underground heavily hinting to one of his underlings that your group should be killed if you try to oppose his coronation as the new king of Ollendor. I recorded their conversation while I was listening to them through one of the crystals about an hour ago. Here is what the two of them said."

 "Actually, I'd prefer to not get involved in this fight at all, if possible."

"I'm afraid that this is not an option," the Overseer says.

"Oh?" I say. "Why not?"

"The Overseer protocol has concluded that the king of the underground is currently the biggest obstacle in Ollendor's path to prosperity," the Overseer says. "As such, I have decided to maintain this city's lockdown until he is dealt with. If you try to leave this city while the lockdown is still in effect, all of my drones will attack you on sight, and if you somehow make it to the city walls in one piece, the giant metal golems at the gates will attack you as well. The only way for you to leave Ollendor without getting attacked by my drones is to join my side and to help me eliminate the king of the underground."

"And if we were to join you in your fight against the king of the underground," Kate says, "what guarantee do we have that you wouldn't turn your weapons on us as soon as you'd get rid of him?"

"The Overseer protocol is not designed to tell any outright lies," the Overseer answers. "The only things I am capable of doing are to withhold critical information on purpose and to mislead people through omission of important facts. As long as you make the terms of our agreement unambiguous enough, you should be able to force me to allow you safe passage out of the city without much problems."

 "Capture?" Hadrik asks. "Don't you mean execute? You're not seriously planning to keep him alive, are you? There's no way that guy can be held in a cell with the type of power he has!"

"That will not be a problem," the Overseer says. "The Ollendor prison is equipped with paralysis cells, which should be more than enough to secure him for now. As long as his movements are mostly limited, he should not be able to perform aura manipulation techniques powerful enough to help him escape."

"Even if you're not planning to kill him, you're still asking us to betray a person who has technically been on our side since the very beginning," Daren says. "I mean, sure, he may be a bit shady, but so far he has given us no legitimate reason to suspect him of wanting to betray us. We can't just be the first ones to screw him over after all we've been through together since we came to this city."

 The light from the blue crystal that the Overseer was using to speak suddenly begins to pulsate a few times, and two seconds later we start hearing the voices of Albert and the king of the underground echoing from the crystal.

"I never said that I don't want to get involved at all," I answer. "I only said that I'm not in the mood to get into any more fights over the leadership of Ollendor. I thought we were supposed to discuss our plan with the king of the underground and reach an agreement, not start a war with him."

"According to the latest information I have obtained, I would say it is extremely unlikely that the underground king would reach an agreement with you on this particular issue," the Overseer says.

 "He didn't... specifically say that Albert should kill us," Daren says, in a somewhat hesitant tone. "It's still possible that he could just want him to bribe us or something."

"He told his assassin lackey that he should solve the problem the way he always does," Kate says. "Let's not try to kid ourselves. It's obvious that the king of the underground wants him to kill us if we don't share their enlightened views of what should happen to Ollendor from now on. The 'discreetly' part probably means that he can't do it here, where everyone's watching, so he would probably need to assassinate us somewhere on the surface, where he could blame our deaths on the Overseer or on the city guards."

"Precisely," the Overseer says. "My prediction is that the king of the underground will very soon launch an all-out attack against me in order to take complete control of the city, and he will likely enlist your aid for this operation, since you are theoretically his allies. By my calculations, the most opportune moment for the king to betray you would be either during your battle against me, or shortly before that.

 "Hmm…" the king of the underground says. "We should be careful to avoid directly antagonizing Daren and his group. The healer has become somewhat of a respected figure in our little underground society after everything he's done to help our people, so it would definitely hurt my image if I were to oppose him openly. That being said, we also cannot afford to risk the future of Ollendor based on the whims of a few people who won't have to actually live here and see the consequences of their poor decisions. If they oppose the idea of me being the new ruler, we will try our best to convince them that for the time being, I am the only viable option."

"And if they refuse to see the truth in front of their eyes?" Albert says. "What then?"

"If they simply disagree with us, then we do nothing," the king says. "It is not worth it to turn them into our enemies over a mere difference of opinion. If they actively try to prevent my coronation, however... all I can say is that this would not be the first time when you've had to deal with a situation like this, and I expect you to solve this issue in the same manner as you've done countless times before."

"Efficiently?" Albert says.

"Discreetly," the king corrects him.

"Your wish is my command, my king," Albert says, and then we see the light from the crystal pulsating again, signaling the end of the recording.

"That backstabbing son of a trampler!" Hadrik says angrily. "Is this how he shows his gratitude after all we've done for him? By ordering his loyal dog to have us murdered if he can no longer have his way?"

 "So..." Hadrik says, "basically you are telling us that even if we choose to ally ourselves with you, we should still agree to join the king of the underground on his trip to the surface, but we should lure him into a trap instead?..."

"That is correct," the Overseer says. "I do not expect you to agree with my terms immediately, of course. I will leave you some time to discuss your options between yourselves, so that you can reach a proper consensus regarding this issue. According to my estimations, the king of the underground should not be able to mobilize his forces any sooner than tomorrow, so I will most likely contact you again through one of these crystals at some point in the evening. Now, if there is nothing else I can help you with, I shall take my leave."

"Um, sure..." Daren says. "Goodbye, for now."

"Farewell," the Overseer says, and then the crystal that he was talking through slowly stops shining with light.

"Well, that was... informative," Daren says. "So, what do you guys think we should do next?"

"Will you calm down?" Illuna interrupts her. "He's obviously bluffing. The only way he could have known the Overseer's location with such pinpoint accuracy is through a premonition. Isn't that right, Barry?"

"Pfft..." I say. "You just had to ruin my fun, didn't you, Illuna?"

"A premonition?..." Arraka says, and then her tone suddenly becomes much more relieved. "Of course! Why didn't I think of that? It was so obvious!"

"So, even with your insane aura sensing capabilities, you can still lose your focus and be fooled by a bluff if your emotions get the better of you," I say in a thoughtful voice. "That's good to know. I'm sure this information will come in handy later!"

Unfortunately, for me, personally, this whole ordeal with the Magium 'fragments' has done nothing but to cast further doubts in my mind about whether or not this prize that they're offering at the end of the tournament would be of any use to me."

"Well," Daren says, "I'm not sure how to tell you this, but when I first heard that they were giving us 'access' to the Magium, I sort of assumed that I wouldn't need to jump through hoops just to understand how this 'access' even works.

"Well... yes, actually!" Daren says. "What else was I supposed to think? They're offering it as a prize, aren't they? Nobody said it was a prize that could potentially end our entire world if you pissed it off too much!"

"Yes, obviously the kings didn't say that, because they most likely have no idea what they're offering," Arraka says.

I haven't exactly been paying attention to the politics of Varathia, but if I were to take an educated guess, I'd say that both the kings and the lessathi are hiding something from each other, and they both think that they have the upper hand.

"Well," Daren says, "I'm not sure how to tell you this, but when I first heard that they were giving us 'access' to the Magium, I sort of assumed that I wouldn't need to jump through hoops just to understand how this 'access' even works. At this point, I am fully expecting the tournament organizers to just put me in front of some big blue crystal at the end and to tell me that I need to use my aura to link to it or something in order to access the Magium's knowledge. If they were to say this to someone like... let's say, Azarius, I'm sure he would probably figure out what to do, but with the knowledge I have... I can't help but think that I'm a little out of my depth, here."

Arraka laughs.

 We walk towards the waiting room for a little while until we reach a corridor that has no blue crystals in the walls at all and is lit entirely by torches. We continue to move forward without saying a word for another minute or so, until doctor Reidzek decides to finally break the silence by clearing his throat.

 "You only figured that out now?" she says. "What did you think was gonna happen, anyway? You figured that maybe they'd give you some trinket and all you'd need to do was press a few buttons to get the Magium? Is that what was going through your head when you joined this tournament?"

"Well... yes, actually!" Daren says. "What else was I supposed to think? They're offering it as a prize, aren't they? Nobody said it was a prize that could potentially end our entire world if you pissed it off too much!"

"Yes, obviously the kings didn't say that, because they most likely have no idea what they're offering," Arraka says. "And the lessathi who are also in charge of organizing the tournament probably didn't feel like telling them about it, because they have their own hidden agenda, and they wouldn't want the kings to find out what's really at stake here. I haven't exactly been paying attention to the politics of Varathia, but if I were to take an educated guess, I'd say that both the kings and the lessathi are hiding something from each other, and they both think that they have the upper hand. They each most likely have their own secret purpose for organizing this tournament, and you losers are too busy dancing to their tune to even consider that you might be getting duped."

 "That is also possible, yes," Illuna says.

"What about the lessathi organizers, then?" Daren says. "What would they have to gain from all of this?"

"It's possible that the lessathi are trying to take advantage of the chaos being caused by this tournament to seize control of some of the kingdoms of Varathia," Kate says. "Another possibility is that they could in fact want the tournament prize for themselves, and they only helped with the organization so that the kings would lead them to the location from where the Magium can be accessed. It's hard to guess what their true purpose is when we know so little about them."

"Your friend, Diane, was part of Meridith's elite guard, right?" I ask Kate. "We could try to ask her about this when we finally meet her again. She might know something about their plans."

"We'll see," Kate says.

"I have to say..." Daren tells me. "I am surprised at how calm and collected you are being right now, Barry. Of all the people here, you are probably by far the one who wants the Magium the most. How are you so unaffected by the fact that the prize you've been fighting so hard to obtain may prove to be completely worthless to you?"

 "So the kings knew from the beginning that the majority of the contestants couldn't even hope to use the Magium, but they let us join anyway?!" Hadrik shouts. "That's even worse than making us hunt for pinecones that can't be detected by anyone other than stillwaters and sages! Do these kings really have no respect at all for the lives of the hundreds or maybe even thousands of mages that died in this tournament, fighting over nothing?"

"Maybe that is what the kings were aiming for, from the very beginning," Illuna says. "Maybe their true objective was to lure the most powerful mages of the main continents away from their homelands, and to encourage them to kill each other so that every continent aside from Varathia would be simultaneously robbed of their strongest fighters. At this rate, I wouldn't be too surprised if the Varathian kings were planning to invade the other continents soon after the end of this tournament."

"Or perhaps the Varathian kings were getting worried that THEY might get invaded, for whatever reason," I say, "and decided to preemptively cull the numbers of their potential attackers. That could also explain why they specifically asked for the winner of this tournament to become the protector of Varathia in case of an outside invasion."

 "Oh, it's because I've already had this conversation before... with Kate," I say. "She saw that I was becoming hesitant about the Magium after what happened in the God of Time's ritual, and she helped me gain back my motivation by suggesting an alternate way in which I could make use of the Magium to turn myself into a mage."

"Is that so?" Daren says, as he gives Kate an impressed look for a few seconds before turning his gaze back to me. "And what was this suggestion that she gave you?"

"The idea is for me to first of all unlock my magical stats from my device in order to be able to use my temporary magical powers to link myself to the Magium," I say. "Then, once I have access to all of the Magium's knowledge, I can take my time researching a way to modify my stat device so that it can extract energy directly from the magical plane instead of getting it from the mages around me, which would essentially turn me into a full-fledged mage. I know it's not a perfect plan, but after giving it some thought, I'd say I'm pretty confident in my odds of success!"

"Well..." Daren says. "I'm not exactly sure what to say about the viability of your plan, but one thing is for certain. We could all use some of your optimism right now."
