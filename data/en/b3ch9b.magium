 "Alright," I say. "Let's go to the Overseer first, then. Can you teleport us there now?"

"I'm on it!" Flower says, as we are both getting enveloped by a bright white light.

"Here we are!" Flower says.

When I look around, I see that we're now somewhere in the sea of light called the ether, with the Overseer's green-eyed drone floating right next to us.

"Processing. Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol now understands why it couldn't find your group anywhere in the ether. Having witnessed your ability to teleport, my assumption is that you all must have teleported to a safe haven where you are undetectable. Is that correct?"

 "Um, yeah," Flower says. "That's right... Wait, you've been looking for us?"

"Affirmative," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol wishes to apologize for the inconvenience it has caused. Your souls were not meant to be teleported outside of your minds along with the rebels' souls. Unfortunately, the technique I used was still experimental, and it ended up affecting the whole area of the battlefield instead of targeting only our common enemies."

"Oh, it's no problem!" Flower says. "Everyone's fine now. So anyway, we wanted to ask you if you'd like to fight Peter and the king of the underground together with us here, on the ethereal plane. I could teleport us to them right now if you want!"

"The Overseer protocol accepts your offer," the green-eyed drone says. "That was the destination that I was heading to as well."

"Great!" Flower says. "Get ready, then. We're teleporting in three... two... one..."

 "The Overseer doesn't have his drones with him, so I doubt he can be of much help," I tell Flower. "I say we just go directly to Peter and fight him by ourselves."

"Well, if you say so, Barry..." Flower says. "Alright, I'm teleporting us there. Are you ready?"

"Yep," I say, and then we both get enveloped by the usual bright light that appears when you are getting teleported.

"What are you doing here?" I suddenly hear the voice of Peter, once we are done teleporting to our new location, in the middle of the ether.

When I turn to look towards Peter, who was somewhere around twenty feet away from us, I see that the king of the underground was also there, like Flower said, and he had already created a body for himself in the ethereal plane. As I get a better look at the two of them, I notice the fact that Peter's eyes are not shining brightly like Flower's, which means that he must not have experienced the same evolution that would allow him to teleport over long distances and to detect souls on the ethereal plane no matter where they are.

"Take a wild guess," I answer Peter.

"So if the aura is linked to my soul," the king continues, "then it would be logical to assume that my soul also has a separate aura of its own which the earthen aura can link itself with, correct?"

"Good!" the king of the underground says. "So I'm not just imagining things, then!"

He then stretches his arm forward, while pointing his palm towards us, and an invisible force suddenly pushes me and Flower back about ten feet.

 "Okay," I tell him, as I get in a special stance and I make some very fast hand movements while I'm imagining the magical energy building up in my fingertips. "I'm saying the word, then."

Before the king has the time to respond, I point my finger at him and a bolt of lightning shoots out of it, straight for his chest. The lightning bolt seems to hit him at first, but then I realize that the only thing I did was to slightly graze his invisible shield made out of hardened aura that is surrounding him.

Following my lead, Flower also commences the attack, by hitting both Peter and the king of the underground with a barrage of fireballs. When the flames from the explosions fade away, I see that Peter had managed to create a dome of ice around them, which shielded them completely but is now quickly melting from all the heat.

"That was quite the powerful attack you fired towards us, little girl," the king of the underground says, once the ice dome is completely gone. "If I didn't know any better, I might even get the wrong idea that you were trying to kill us."

 As he finishes his sentence, the king extends his arms towards us and right afterwards Flower and I get surrounded by a box made out of semi-transparent impenetrable walls, which look very similar to the ones that were being used by Talmak's elf subordinate. Before I get to ask myself what the king is trying to do, the air inside the box starts to get colder and colder, to the point that we would likely become frozen statues if we were to spend more than half a minute in here.

"Hold on tight," Flower tells me, as she grabs my arm. "We're teleporting out."

As usual, a bright light surrounds us and our bodies start to vibrate loudly. A few seconds later, we find ourselves outside the box, but it looks like we have a slight problem on our hands. A new semi-transparent box was created just as quickly around us, and the air inside it is also beginning to freeze at a rapid pace, likely as a result of one of Peter's spells.

 After being unconscious for some time, I begin to vaguely hear the voices of the king of the underground and Peter, who both sound rather tense. When I try to wake up, I realize that I can't move my body at all and even my eyes won't open. It feels like I'm only half-awake right now, with my mind still trying to decide if what I'm hearing is really happening, or if it's all just a dream.

"We can't just leave them here, damn it!" the king of the underground says. "They're going to get killed at this rate."

"With all due respect, sir... why do you care so much about what happens to them?" Peter says. "They betrayed us and our cause. They allied themselves with the Overseer. What obligation do we have to save their lives?"

"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need," the king of the underground says. "At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!"

"As you wish, my lord," Peter says. "But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it."

Shortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while. The silence doesn't last for long, however, because it soon gets replaced with the sound of Flower shouting in my ear, while she is shaking me violently.

 "Let's try to move in separate directions after we teleport again," I tell Flower in a low voice. "I don't think he can maintain two boxes at the same time with his aura technique."

"Okay," Flower says. "Get ready!"

Just like before, Flower grabs my arm and then we teleport outside, but this time we both move away from each other so that we can no longer get caught inside the same box. Sadly, my prediction was completely wrong, because the king easily manages to trap us in two separate boxes, and now Peter is also freezing the air inside them again, without much trouble.

Seeing what happened, Flower panics and she quickly teleports inside my box, grabbing my arm again and then teleporting us out, but as soon as she releases me, she gets a powerful headache that almost makes her faint.

"Flower, what happened?" I ask her.

"I... think I went a little overboard with the teleporting..." she says. "Give me a minute... I'm trying to recover."

"You do not have a minute, I'm afraid," the king of the underground says, as he traps us inside a semi-transparent box again and Peter begins to freeze the air inside it. "That is to say... unless your friend Barry can pull another rabbit out of his hat and come up with a teleportation spell of his own in the next fifteen seconds, of course. I have to admit that nothing coming from him would surprise me anymore at this point."

 While the king is talking, I am not processing any of his words, because my mind is too busy going through every single spell I've ever learned in a matter of seconds, in a desperate attempt to figure out if there's anything at all that could help me get out of this situation alive. While my head is filled with hundreds of possible combinations of spells, I can slowly feel the cold creeping in, until my whole body is trembling uncontrollably.

During this time, Flower attempts to get us out of the box a few times, but she just can't concentrate enough to cast her teleportation spell, and the ever-increasing coldness in the air is only making it harder for her to stay awake. Eventually, we both succumb to the freezing cold, and we lose our consciousness.

I have to admit that nothing coming from him would surprise me anymore at this--"

 Before he gets to finish his sentence, the king of the underground gets attacked by a powerful fire beam, and he is forced to release us from the box in order to focus all of his efforts on reinforcing the aura shield around himself.

As Flower and I get away from the freezing air, we see that the one who attacked the king was the Overseer, who finally decided to stop spectating and join the battle as well.

"My apologies for not helping you sooner," the Overseer says. "I was uncertain whether your current situation was part of your plan or if you were genuinely in need of assistance."

"It's fine," I tell the Overseer, as I'm still catching my breath. "Keep doing what you're doing. Don't give the king of the underground the time to fight back."

"Understood," the Overseer says.

While the Overseer is keeping his fire beam aimed at the king of the underground and Flower is still recovering, I decide to rejoin the fight by striking Peter with the same lightning spell that I used before on the king.

 To my surprise, instead of trying to evade it, Peter makes the exact same movements as me, only in reverse, and my lightning disappears as soon as it reaches him.

Was that... the Brinhorn dispelling technique? Is this guy seriously using my own technique against me? Oh, he's going to regret this.

"What are you blabbering about?" Peter asks me, having apparently heard my thoughts. "What do you mean 'your own technique'? If you were trying to distract me, you should have gone with a lie that was a bit more credible."

Ah, crap. I forgot to think without words again. I'd better make sure to think faster from now on, or I'll give away all of my plans to him.

Okay, so the way I see it, this technique has one major weakness, which is the fact that you need to figure out what your enemy is casting very quickly, so that you can do all of the movements in reverse and somehow still finish them fast enough to counter your opponent's spell. Due to this fact, multi-step dispelling is particularly vulnerable to feints.

Oh, boy... I really hope I didn't think all that out loud, or I'll be making a complete fool of myself.

 "Barry, wake up!" she shouts, desperately. "You're fading away! Please, wake up!"

As I finally manage to pull myself together and open my eyes, I realize that she was right. I really am fading away. My body has become almost completely transparent and I am being overwhelmed by a sensation of fatigue and nausea that is hard to describe, while my consciousness is drifting between the earthen and ethereal plane constantly.

"Barry, listen to me!" Flower says, when she sees that I've opened my eyes. "Do you remember what the inside of your mind looked like on the ethereal plane? Can you visualize it?"

I try to listen to her words, but they are not making any sense in my head. Everything feels like it's so far away... as if I were only a spectator watching the end of my life unfold before my eyes, without grasping the direct impact that it has on me, as a person. I am just so tired. The only thing I want to do now is go back to sleep.

 "Barry, I need to know that you understand me!" Flower says in a panicky voice. "I need you to tell me that-- oh my gods, you're almost gone. Barry, stay with me, please! Barry!!!"

Flower's screams are nothing more than background noise to me now. As soon as my body from the ethereal plane becomes completely transparent, the fatigue disappears, and it is replaced with a feeling of calm, as I quickly begin to lose any sense of who I am or what I had been doing until a few moments prior, and I can feel myself melding with the light around me, while my consciousness is slowly fading away.

At long last, it is over. At long last, I can rest.

Just like before, Flower grabs my arm and then we teleport out of the box, but this time we rematerialize right next to our enemies. As I predicted, the king avoids using his semi-transparent box when he sees us so close to him, and he tries to use his aura manipulation to push us away instead.

Flower, however does not give the king of the underground the time to use his technique, and she shoots a beam of fire at him, thus forcing him to focus all of his efforts on reinforcing the aura shield around himself.

Peter is too busy focusing on his own movements to notice the subtle difference, so by the time I point my finger at him and shoot the lightning, he fully commits to the dispel and he doesn't move a muscle from his position.

"Perhaps you are right," Peter says, as he finishes his healing spell. "Let me see if I can try something a little more... overwhelming."

He then begins to move his hands very quickly, while he is amassing an insane amount of energy for his next spell.

 Just as I thought I was getting the upper hand, the unthinkable happens, and the fireballs from Peter's previous spell quickly start forming around me again, despite my successful dispelling. Knowing that I have only a few seconds to get away from them, I activate the air currents that were lying dormant around me until now and I fly away, trying to put as much distance between me and the fireballs as I can.

"You won't be able to outrun them," Peter tells me, as I am now dodging fireballs left and right. "Since you knew how to cast the spell in reverse, I assume that you must also be aware of what it does. Those fireballs will follow you to the end of the ethereal plane if they need to. There is no way to stop them."

He's right. The only way to counter this spell is to either dispel it in time or to conjure a shield around myself that is powerful enough to withstand the impact of fifty explosions. There's no way I can build a protective layer of earth or ice that is durable enough with the limited spells I have at my disposal. That is the reason why I instinctively tried to dispel it. How did the dispelling not work? I did everything correctly, and I even saw the spell being cancelled. So, then why?... Why are these fireballs still following me?!

"Affirmative," the Overseer says.

In reality, the fireballs were all being controlled by him manually, and none of them were following you automatically."

"For any complaints, please refer to section 5C-E789 of the Overseer operating manual," the Overseer tells Peter.

"The Overseer protocol does not possess the ability to be sorry or to regret any of its past actions," says the Overseer. "The only thing I am capable of doing is to analyze my mistakes and learn from them."

 After being unconscious for some time, I begin to vaguely hear the voices of the king of the underground and Peter, who both sound rather tense. When I try to wake up, I realize that I can't move my body at all and even my eyes won't open. It feels like I'm only half-awake right now, with my mind still trying to decide if what I'm hearing is really happening, or if it's all just a dream.

"We can't just leave them here, damn it!" the king of the underground says. "They're going to get killed at this rate."

"With all due respect, sir... why do you care so much about what happens to them?" Peter says. "They betrayed us and our cause. They allied themselves with the Overseer. What obligation do we have to save their lives?"

"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need," the king of the underground says. "At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!"

"As you wish, my lord," Peter says. "But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it."

Shortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while. The silence doesn't last for long, however, because it soon gets replaced with the sound of Flower shouting in my ear, while she is shaking me violently.

 Peter's first attack against the Overseer is to try to create a stone cage around him in order to limit his movement. Since the spell he is using is easy to predict from the first few hand motions, I dispel it with ease, forcing Peter to retreat as the green-eyed drone is now the one going on the offensive.

After I cancel his second and third spell, Peter finally figures out what I'm doing and he stops using any of his complicated spells, limiting himself only to the simplest and most basic type of magic in his repertoire, so that he won't give me enough time to use my dispelling technique before he finishes his casting. I try in vain to predict his next few spells, but I soon realize that there's no point in using this tactic anymore. I might as well just fight him with regular spells, because right now I'm not making any meaningful contributions to this battle.

Just as I am about to fly closer to Peter, I feel two ropes tying themselves tightly around my ankles, and then not even a second later, two other ropes bind themselves around my wrists as well, pulling my arms behind my back. When I turn my head around, I realize that the four ropes had been conjured from below me while I wasn't looking. 

 I was so focused on their battle that it didn't even cross my mind to check my surroundings. Was this his plan all along? To distract me with his fight against the Overseer while secretly using conjuration magic to make these restraints appear out of nowhere? Damn it, if only I could move my arms a little, I might be able to burn the ropes with a fire spell or something. I'm not at a level where I can cast spells without moving my arms, yet. Isn't there some spell that requires me to only move my fingers which could be helpful in this situation? What about the Overseer? Maybe he can get me out of this! I need to call out to him.

"Hey, Overseer, can you help--"

"Time's up," Peter says, before I get the time to finish my sentence, and then he uses my initial lightning spell against me, making me lose my consciousness in a matter of seconds.

 Since I could pretty much guess what spell he was going to use before he even started moving his hands, I easily managed to cast the spell in reverse and to dispel it before he could finish his motions. That being said, there is no way for me to dispel the box itself, so the drone is still trapped, even if it is no longer in mortal danger.

"Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol is unable to free itself from its captivity or cast spells outside of the box without the use of its experimental features,"  the green-eyed drone says. "The Overseer apologizes for the inconvenience, and hopes that the current circumstances will not negatively impact the rating you will give it in the end-of-month survey."

"Don't worry, Overseer, I got you covered!" I say. "No matter what spell he casts while you're inside that box, I'm pretty confident that I can dispel it."

As I am saying these words, Peter gives me one long look, and he just stands there for about ten seconds, contemplating on what I've said.

"What's the matter, Peter?" I say. "Did you give up already?"

"No..." Peter says. "But I think it's safe to say that I might have been underestimating you a little bit, until now. After thinking things over for a short while, I realized that you are for all intents and purposes a mage and a generalist in this realm, and maybe I should start treating you as such. Tell me, Barry, have you ever seen a fight between Brinhorn and Azarius?"

 "Yeah, I did see a few of those," I say. "Brinhorn always used to insist on me coming to watch his official matches while I was still apprenticing under him."

"Apprenticing under Brinh--" Peter begins to say, but then he interrupts himself, as he closes his eyes and starts to massage his forehead with his fingers. "Never mind. I don't care if you actually were that man's apprentice or not. The point I was trying to make is that whenever two generalists fight, they have a certain way of doing battle that is not comparable to any other kinds of mage fights. Do you know what I'm talking about?"

"I mean, yeah, it would have been pretty hard to not see the difference," I say.

"Good," Peter says. "I only had the opportunity to see one of their duels, due to how insanely hard it is to obtain permission to leave Varathia as an Ollendor citizen, but that one duel will remain imprinted in my mind forever."

While Peter is talking, I can slowly feel the whole world beginning to spin around me, as if I'd just gulped down an entire bottle of dwarven ale.

"As a former apprentice of Brinhorn, I'm sure that you will immediately recognize the famous battle that I am about to recreate before your eyes. Let us see if you can live up to your old mentor's teachings."

 As I continue to narrowly avoid the multitude of homing projectiles, I happen to catch a glimpse of Peter, who seems to be deeply focused on the fireballs that are following me, and is even directing some of them with his hands from afar.

What's going on, here?... Why does it look like he's controlling some of those fireballs manually? The whole point of this spell is that the fireballs are supposed to follow their target on their own, so that you can continue to cast other spells while your enemy is distracted. Normally, Peter should have no business directing any of the projectiles.

But what if...

What if this isn't his previous spell at all?... What if he just used his ethereal powers to create a bunch of fireballs out of nothing, in the same way that Flower made that palm tree and turned it into a cart?

Of course... If I think about it like this, then it all makes sense!

My dispelling did work! He's just trying to fool me into thinking that it didn't, so that I won't try to interrupt him and make him lose his focus on all these dozens of fireballs that he is controlling individually.

This is it. This is the answer that I was looking for. Now I know exactly what I need to do!

 After I dodge a few more of the flaming projectiles, I lure them away from Peter on purpose, and once my path towards him is clear, I make a beeline for my opponent, while preparing a very simple daze spell that can barely make someone dizzy for a few seconds. 

Once I get close enough, I cast the spell on him and the very next moment, all of the fireballs disappear, while Peter is quickly recovering from his short stupor.

"Hah!" I say. "I knew it! I knew that my dispelling couldn't have failed! I should have known that this would be a trick from the very beginning."

"You are testing my patience..." Peter says. "You don't want me to use my actual powerful spells against you in this realm. Give up now, if you don't want to risk your life needlessly."

"I'm sorry, was that supposed to intimidate me?" I say. "Because that didn't sound scary at all. Maybe you should try investing a few more points in your Bluff stat."

Instead of answering me, Peter begins to cast an even more complicated spell that if I'm not mistaken is meant to fill a huge area with endless raindrops of a freezing liquid that is cold enough to incapacitate you in a matter of seconds. I have to do something about this quick.

 After being unconscious for some time, I begin to vaguely hear the voices of the king of the underground and Peter, who both sound rather tense. When I try to wake up, I realize that I can't move my body at all and even my eyes won't open. It feels like I'm only half-awake right now, with my mind still trying to decide if what I'm hearing is really happening, or if it's all just a dream.

"We can't just leave them here, damn it!" the king of the underground says. "They're going to get killed at this rate."

"With all due respect, sir... why do you care so much about what happens to them?" Peter says. "They betrayed us and our cause. They allied themselves with the Overseer. What obligation do we have to save their lives?"

"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need," the king of the underground says. "At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!"

"As you wish, my lord," Peter says. "But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it."

Shortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while. The silence doesn't last for long, however, because it soon gets replaced with the sound of Flower shouting in my ear, while she is shaking me violently.

 I quickly cast a spell that creates a floating platform made out of rock, and then I place it above my head so that it can defend me from the freezing rain.

Just as I am done positioning my roof, I feel two ropes tying themselves tightly around my ankles, and then not even a second later, two other ropes bind themselves around my wrists as well, pulling my arms behind my back. When I turn my head around, I realize that the four ropes had been conjured from below me while I wasn't looking. The rain of ice isn't anywhere close to starting either, despite the fact that Peter has apparently finished his spell.

 Does this mean it was all a ruse? He faked the spell in order to distract me and just used conjuration magic to create these ropes instead? Damn it, if only I could move my arms a little, I might be able to burn these ropes with a fire spell or something. I'm not at a level where I can cast spells without moving my arms, yet. Isn't there some spell that requires me to only move my fingers which could be helpful in this situation? Think, Barry! There has to be something!

"Time's up," Peter says, and then he uses my initial lightning spell against me, making me lose my consciousness in a matter of seconds.

 I quickly begin to cast the same spell as Peter in reverse, struggling to keep up with his speed so that I can finish it in time for the dispelling to work.

As I am busy concentrating on my hand movements, I feel two ropes tying themselves tightly around my ankles, and then not even a second later, two other ropes bind themselves around my wrists as well, pulling my arms behind my back.

 Instead of trying to counter his spell, I decide to wait, and to pay close attention to what my enemy is doing. I know this is risky, but my gut is telling me that he is trying to trick me again, somehow.

As I closely observe Peter, one thing about him in particular strikes me as odd. He is trying to make it seem like he's looking straight at me, but he keeps throwing short glances at something below me every now and then while he is casting his spell. When I look below me as well, in order to see what he was so preoccupied with, I notice four ropes that are getting longer and longer, and moving towards me.

"You bastard!" I tell Peter, as I do some quick movements with my hands and then send a burst of flames to burn all of the ropes. "You were trying to fool me again, weren't you? You were just faking the freezing rain spell so that you could keep me distracted and tie me with the ropes! Do you think I'm stupid or something?"

"No," Peter says, as he now stops pretending to cast the ice rain spell. "But I was hoping that you'd at least take a few more seconds to figure it out. I think it's safe to say that I've been underestimating you a little bit. You are for all intents and purposes a mage and a generalist in this realm, and I should treat you as such. Tell me, Barry, have you ever seen a fight between Brinhorn and Azarius?"

 "Yeah, I did see a few of those," I say. "Brinhorn always used to insist on me coming to watch his official matches while I was still apprenticing under him."

"Apprenticing under Brinh--" Peter begins to say, but then he interrupts himself, as he closes his eyes and starts to massage his forehead with his fingers. "Never mind. I don't care if you actually were that man's apprentice or not. The point I was trying to make is that whenever two generalists fight, they have a certain way of doing battle that is not comparable to any other kinds of mage fights. Do you know what I'm talking about?"

"I mean, yeah, it would have been pretty hard to not see the difference," I say.

"Good," Peter says. "I only had the opportunity to see one of their duels, due to how insanely hard it is to obtain permission to leave Varathia as an Ollendor citizen, but that one duel will remain imprinted in my mind forever."

While Peter is talking, I can slowly feel the whole world beginning to spin around me, as if I'd just gulped down an entire bottle of dwarven ale.

"As a former apprentice of Brinhorn, I'm sure that you will immediately recognize the famous battle that I am about to recreate before your eyes. Let us see if you can live up to your old mentor's teachings."

TEXT:

 My sense of balance has been completely thrown off. I feel like I'm about to puke. I didn't even know you could have these sensations in an immaterial plane of existence such as this.

That being said, Peter has been kind enough to notify me in advance of what spell he was going to use against me, so I'm not planning to betray his expectations. Recalling the exact spells that Brinhorn cast to get himself out of this situation in one of his duels against Azarius, I begin by making flames come out of my hands, and then I use my palms like hot irons to burn both of my cheeks for a few seconds. As I struggle to endure the excruciating pain from my burnt face, I quickly conjure two boulders in the air on both sides of me, and I use them to smack myself in the face from both sides, right on the burn marks.

When I'm done with that, I create a bucketful of freezing-cold water above my head, and I let it drop on top of me, drenching my entire body in the icy liquid. While I am still trembling from the cold, I point towards Peter with my right hand and then I spin my index-finger counter-clockwise, while I imagine some invisible earplugs dropping from his ears.

 "Astounding..." Peter says, with what appears to be genuine amazement in his voice, as he is slowly clapping, while I am still trying to stop my body from shaking violently. "I was half-joking when I told you to live up to your old mentor's teachings, but I never expected you to go this far. You actually reproduced every single one of Brinhorn's spells from the beginning of that battle, including the rare variant of his dispelling technique that he used to get rid of Azarius' protection against his own sonic attacks."

"Yes, w-w-well, I was the o-o-one who taught him that dispelling technique a-a-after all!" I say, trying my best to sound tough, even though I'm still trembling like crazy from the cold.

"I must admit that I didn't think you would go through with it, even if you knew the spells that you needed to cast," Peter says. "Seeing you inflict so much damage upon yourself without hesitation in the same way that Brinhorn did in that match makes me wonder if some of his craziness rubbed off on you or if it was in fact the other way around..."

 "I'm really glad to see how well you two are getting along," the king of the underground says loudly, from a distance, as he is still busy building barriers around himself to defend from Flower, who is attacking him from all possible angles, trying to find a weak spot in his defenses, "but maybe you could hurry it up just a little, Peter?... I can barely hold off this ethereal girl on my own with how weak my aura is in this realm. Surely, you don't want to have to fight both her and Barry at the same time, do you?"

"No, my king..." Peter says. "I will try my best to hasten things on my end."

"And how exactly are you planning to do that?" I ask Peter. "Just to be clear, your trick with the invisible ear plugs won't work a second time. If you want to cast that sonic spell again, you'd better be prepared to dunk yourself in cold water afterwards."

"Have you already forgotten that we're supposed to be reenacting one of the battles between Brinhorn and Azarius?" Peter says. "We've barely even recreated the first few seconds of that fight so far. There is so much more that we need to do."

 "Well, it's not like I had much choice in the matter," I answer him, having finally stopped my trembling. "That sonic attack you did just now is too high-pitched to be perceived by our ears, but its effects are almost impossible to dispel unless you are a highly-skilled, specialized white mage. That is probably one of the reasons why Azarius enjoys sonic spells so much. They are incredibly versatile and ridiculously hard to counter through normal means. Brinhorn might not have given me much reason to genuinely look up to him during the time we've spent together, but I will say that this one particular way he chose to counter Azarius' spell was nothing short of genius."

"It was, indeed..." Peter says, looking as if he were reminiscing over a time long past. "It felt so stupid when I saw it at the time, and yet it was so effective, in its simplicity. Why bother with countering the effects of a complicated sound pressure spell that directly targets your inner ear and messes up your sense of balance, when you can just use tried-and-true, age-old methods that dwarves have been using to get out of their drunken stupors for hundreds of years! I have to say... that fight was truly a sight to behold!"

 "You've seen how far I'm willing to go to reproduce Brinhorn's exact spells from that fight and you still want to continue?" I say. "I'm having a hard time figuring out if you're being stupidly brave, or just plain stupid."

"And I'm having a hard time seeing how you can be so confident in your victory, when you should already know all too well who won the fight that we're now copying," Peter says. "I'll give you a hint. It's the same person who's won every single time since those two started having their duels."

"Just because we're doing a reenactment doesn't mean that I can't go off-script just a tiny bit," I say. "Don't worry, you'll get to see the source of my confidence soon enough."

"Let's see it, then," Peter says, and then he begins to attack me in the same way that Azarius attacked Brinhorn all those years ago.

"We can't just leave them here, damn it!" the king of the underground says. "They're going to get killed at this rate."

 I am now finding myself surrounded by a hundred or so manticores, which are flying around me from all directions, including directly below me. I already know from the battle between Brinhorn and Azarius that the majority of these are supposed to be illusions, but in the original fight, five of the winged lions were real and Azarius was also hiding amongst them, shapeshifted as a manticore while waiting for the ideal moment to strike.

Just like in the battle that we are copying, Peter has managed to successfully cast an illusion spell, a summoning spell and a shapeshifting spell almost simultaneously, without giving me much time to react. The fact that he managed to cast all three spells without making any movements at all caught me completely off-guard. He must have been secretly preparing the spells while I was being distracted by our previous conversation.

Unfortunately, while I was initially able to track which were the real manticores and which were the illusions, it has gotten harder and harder for me to tell them apart as they've been shuffling their positions constantly for the past twenty seconds. Similarly to what Azarius did against Brinhorn, Peter is in no hurry to attack me, because he knows that the more time passes, the more I will doubt myself on which of the flying monsters I need to defend myself from and which I'll need to ignore.

 If I attempt the same tactics as Brinhorn now, Peter will surely be prepared for it, and I will have fallen into one of his traps yet again. I will need to catch him by surprise if I want to gain the upper hand in this battle.

Instead of waiting for my adversary to make the first move, I fly through the swarm of fake manticores, and I head straight for Peter, whom I've been monitoring closely ever since he shapeshifted. On my way to him, one of the real manticores tries to intercept me, but I quickly dodge to the side and then I continue onwards, getting increasingly closer to my target by the second.

If I can get close enough to cast a paralysis spell on him before he shifts back to his human form, I win. He should be vulnerable in that state, because shapeshifting does not happen instantly. Or will he attack me as a manticore, instead? Either way, I'm ready for him. Come on, Peter, what will you choose to do?

Just as I get within casting range of my spell, the image of the manticore in front of me disappears, and it is replaced with Peter, who was already aiming a paralysis spell of his own at me, which manages to hit me before I have the time to react. Apparently, Peter had never shapeshifted in the first place, and was only using illusion magic to trick me into thinking that he did. As I'm trying in vain to dispel the paralysis spell without moving, Peter casts another spell on me that puts me to sleep.

 The spells that Brinhorn used to get out of this predicament are complicated, and I've never had the opportunity to practice them before, but they're the best option I've got. At least I know the theory behind them, so I'll just have to do my best to figure out the magical flow patterns based on the knowledge I already have. Let's give this a shot.

As the manticores are still circling around me, trying to get me confused, I take advantage of the short respite that my enemy has granted me to quickly test several flow patterns that I've noticed in the past, through my many years of studying magical theory. Once I find the motions that seem to work, I visualize all of the magical particles in my head and I guide them on their path, while I play around with different levels of magical intensity until the flow reacts positively to my aura.

The first spell that I cast is one that temporarily enhances my sight and focus, similarly to the Observation stat from my stat device, which I am not carrying with me in this immaterial realm. As soon as my power of observation increases, I immediately confirm which of the manticores are real, because they are the only ones that are deviating from the general trajectory that the majority of the other manticores are following. My greater focus also makes it easier to keep an eye on Peter, whom I've been monitoring closely ever since he shapeshifted.

"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need," the king of the underground says. "At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!"

"As you wish, my lord," Peter says. "But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it."

Shortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while. The silence doesn't last for long, however, because it soon gets replaced with the sound of Flower shouting in my ear, while she is shaking me violently.

 Now that I don't need to worry about losing sight of the summoned manticores anymore, I can finally concentrate on winning this battle.

From what I remember, Brinhorn was doing fine for most of this fight, and the only real mistake he made was towards the end, so it should be okay for me to copy his spells until then, right? Let's see... Next up was a spell that slightly boosts my reflexes. If I recall correctly, the moves required for this one are-- hey wait a minute, why is Peter suddenly diving for me? That's not what Azarius did. Doesn't he know that he's making himself into an easy target by attacking me like this? He can't instantly shift back to his human form, so he will be highly vulnerable during that time. Or is he planning to attack me in his manticore form? It doesn't matter either way. If that's how he wants to play this, then I'll just hit him with a paralysis spell as soon as he gets within range, and that will be the end of it.

 Seeing that Peter is still making a beeline for me, I get in my stance and I prepare my attack, aiming for his chest area. Just as I fire my spell, the image of the manticore in front of me disappears, and it is replaced by Peter, who had apparently never shapeshifted in the first place, and only used illusion magic to make me think that he did. The discrepancy between the positioning of his real body and the one of his fake manticore body makes me miss my shot, and before I have the chance to recover, Peter hits me with a paralysis spell of his own, followed by a sleep spell, making me lose consciousness soon afterwards.

TEXT:

 I am now finding myself surrounded by a hundred or so manticores, which are flying around me from all directions, including directly below me. I already know from the battle between Brinhorn and Azarius that the majority of these are supposed to be illusions, but in the original fight, five of the winged lions were real and Azarius was also hiding amongst them, shapeshifted as a manticore while waiting for the ideal moment to strike.

Just like in the battle that we are copying, Peter has managed to successfully cast an illusion spell, a summoning spell and a shapeshifting spell almost simultaneously, without giving me much time to react. The fact that he managed to cast all three spells without making any movements at all caught me completely off-guard. He must have been secretly preparing the spells while I was being distracted by our previous conversation.

Unfortunately, while I was initially able to track which were the real manticores and which were the illusions, it has gotten harder and harder for me to tell them apart as they've been shuffling their positions constantly for the past twenty seconds. Similarly to what Azarius did against Brinhorn, Peter is in no hurry to attack me, because he knows that the more time passes, the more I will doubt myself on which of the flying monsters I need to defend myself from and which I'll need to ignore.

 The spells that Brinhorn used to get out of this predicament are complicated, and I've never had the opportunity to practice them before, but they're the best option I've got. At least I know the theory behind them, so I'll just have to do my best to figure out the magical flow patterns based on the knowledge I already have. Let's give this a shot.

As the manticores are still circling around me, trying to get me confused, I take advantage of the short respite that my enemy has granted me to quickly test several flow patterns that I've noticed in the past, through my many years of studying magical theory. Once I find the motions that seem to work, I visualize all of the magical particles in my head and I guide them on their path, while I play around with different levels of magical intensity until the flow reacts positively to my aura.

The first spell that I cast is one that temporarily enhances my sight and focus, similarly to the Observation stat from my stat device, which I am not carrying with me in this immaterial realm. As soon as my power of observation increases, I immediately confirm which of the manticores are real, because they are the only ones that are deviating from the general trajectory that the majority of the other manticores are following. My greater focus also makes it easier to keep an eye on Peter, whom I've been monitoring closely ever since he shapeshifted.

Now that I don't need to worry about losing sight of the summoned manticores anymore, I can finally concentrate on winning this battle.

 The question is... should I continue to copy what Brinhorn did, or should I do something else? So far Peter has been reproducing the battle perfectly, but there's no guarantee that he'll do it until the end. At a certain point, he's bound to deviate from the original fight in some way and maybe it would be better if I made the first move rather than-- okay, never mind, too late for that. Peter is now diving straight for me in his manticore form. Azarius never did anything like this against Brinhorn. 

Is he going to transform back into his human form and cast a spell at me once he gets closer?... No, no, no, the shapeshifting process can't be done instantly, and it would leave him too vulnerable. Then is he planning to attack me while he's in his manticore form instead? Something doesn't add up, here. This has to be one of his traps again! I can feel it... I think he's trying to goad me into attacking him. Let's see if he'll reveal his cards to me if I play along a little.

I get into a stance and I pretend that I'm about to cast a short-range paralysis spell on him as soon as he gets closer. Okay, this should be convincing enough. Come on, Peter, show me what you're--

Before I even get to finish my thought process, the image of the manticore in front of me disappears, and it is replaced by Peter, who had apparently never shapeshifted in the first place, and only used illusion magic to make me think that he did. Just as he casts a paralysis spell of his own, I use my air currents to dash away from him and to narrowly avoid his attack.

 So this is what he had up his sleeve... At least now there shouldn't be any more tricks, so I can focus on--

Once again my thoughts get interrupted, because two manticores suddenly lunge at me from opposite directions. I instinctively dodge them both, but then four more of the flying creatures make a dive for me, and the other hundred or so of them seem to be preparing to engage me as well. Now I get what this guy was doing.

In order to pay attention to all of those manticores at once I needed my focus to remain uninterrupted, but Peter's surprise attack from earlier was just the thing he needed to break my concentration. Now I am no longer certain of which manticores are real, and I no longer have the luxury to sit back and calmly analyze the situation. For all intents and purposes, I am now practically fighting against one hundred manticores and a generalist all at once. Well played. 

It looks like I'm going to have to make some serious improvisations if I want to make it out of this alive. Sorry Brinhorn, it's nothing personal, but I'm afraid that your previous performance during this battle is no longer of any use to me.

 For a short while, I was hoping that the anti-poison elixir which I drank on the earthen plane might actually work here, but I guess I was being too optimistic. The effects of the poison hit me almost instantly, as I'm now getting a strong headache and I begin to cough up blood. The headache is nowhere near as bad as the one that I got from the botched teleportation when I was transported to the underground caverns with Leila, but that's not really saying much. This is still much worse than any hangover I've ever had, and it's greatly affecting my concentration.

Of all the things that could have gotten the best of me, it just had to be poison... It's a good thing that Illuna isn't here, or I'd never hear the end of it.

I waste no time and I blow the poison cloud away with a gust of wind. The harm has already been done, but at least now it won't get any worse than it already is. Now where is Peter hiding?... I assumed that he would try to use the mist as cover to take me by surprise, but he is nowhere in sight. Don't tell me that he used the poison cloud just to run away?...

 "I only tried this spell on a whim, but I never imagined that it would actually work," I hear Peter's voice, who has apparently turned himself invisible while I wasn't watching. "What kind of an idiot goes into a mage battle without having cast any sort of protection against poison attacks? Maybe I've overestimated you after all..."

"What's with the invisibility spell?" I tell Peter, as I cough up some more blood. "Do you think you're Albert or something? You do realize that you're nowhere near as good as him at hiding your aura, don't you? I can easily tell where you are and I don't even have my stat device here to boost my magical sense."

 "You might be good at memorizing spells, but you don't seem to be very well versed in poisons," Peter says. "Let me give you a hint. Time is not on your side right now. The more you wait, the more the effects of the poison will sink in, and you will lose all of your senses one by one. Your ability to detect auras will likely be the first one you'll lose, followed by your sense of smell and then your sight. I am only giving you this warning because of what little respect I still have left for you as a fellow generalist. If you still have any secret techniques that you were saving up until the last moment, then I recommend that you use them all now. Do not disappoint me any further."

 After being unconscious for some time, I begin to vaguely hear the voices of the king of the underground and Peter, who both sound rather tense.

 If this is going to be my last stand, then I'd better give it my all.

As I struggle to endure the pain from the headache, I begin to cast a combination of three spells with overlapping patterns that, if done correctly, should unleash an explosion of a quick-drying glue-like substance that will greatly restrict my enemy's movements.

 Just as I'm about to finish casting the spells, I get a strong nausea and I lose my focus completely, which essentially causes my technique to be cancelled.

"I'm not sure what you were trying to do, but I'm going to assume that this was supposed to be your secret technique," Peter says. "I was a fool for being so cautious around you until now. Have a good night."

"What do you mean--" I start to say, but then Peter casts one final spell on me and he immediately puts me to sleep.

 "You know, I really appreciate all the help you're giving me, Peter," I say, as I struggle to appear unaffected by the headache. "You were even kind enough to remind me that I still have a secret technique which I haven't used until now. I might have completely forgotten about it if you hadn't mentioned it, so thank you for that!"

"If you still think you can defeat me, then you'd better do it now," Peter says. "Soon, you won't even be able to tell where I am anymore."

"Actually, I think I might have a better idea!" I say. "Why don't I hold on to this secret technique for a while longer, to keep you on the edge? This strategy seems to have been working wonders so far!"

Peter does not answer me and I can't see the reaction on his face since he's still invisible, but if I were to guess, I'd say that he's probably pretty pissed right now. The fact that he specifically brought up the idea of me revealing my secret techniques made his previous 'advice' seem very suspicious to me. He's clearly trying to bait me, here. If this poison were really meant to get worse over time, he would have tried to stall me instead of telling me to attack him. There really was no reason for him to tell me about all of this unless...

Unless his poison is only temporary and he never bothered to learn any poison spells with long lasting effects! Yes, that has to be it! Now that I'm paying some more attention to my headache and nausea, it does kind of feel like it's getting better, even though the improvement is subtle. Let's see if I can buy a little more time by taking advantage of his unfounded cautiousness around me.

 "By the gods, you were telling the truth!" I say, as I am now feigning some fear in my voice. "The poison really is getting worse! What have you done to me, you bastard?!"

"...I warned you that this would happen," Peter says, in a slightly hesitant voice. "Did you think I was bluffing? Now hurry up and use your spells, before--"

"What did you do to your aura?!" I shout all of a sudden. "Reveal yourself, you coward! I thought you wanted to have a fair fight!"

"What are you talking about, you lunatic?" Peter says. "The poison couldn't have possibly affected you this badly in such a short amount of time. In fact, by now, you should already be--"

He pauses for a few seconds, as he slowly realizes what I've been doing.

"You figured it out, didn't you?" he asks me. "You were just buying time so that the effects of the poison would wear off..."

"Indeed," I say, as my headache and nausea have almost completely disappeared. "And now that I'm feeling well again, we can continue to duel fair and square, like the two fellow generalists that we are! Don't you agree?"

 Shortly after I finish my sentence, I begin to feel one of the most eerie and hard to describe sensations that I've ever experienced in my life. The feeling that I'm getting is as if my consciousness is being repeatedly thrust through a tunnel, back and forth, and it can't seem to decide at which end of the tunnel its destination is. 

As this is happening, I'm finding myself for one second lying face-first in a puddle on a street, during a storm, and for the next second I'm back here on the ethereal plane, floating in the middle of the sea of light. 

After being thrown around between the earthen and ethereal plane a few more times, I can sense all of the light around me connecting directly to my mind, and then I begin to hear some very clear thoughts in my head, as if they were my own, even though I am positive that I'm not the one thinking them.

 "This is not the place to resolve your conflict," the voice in my head says. "Return to your sanctuaries now, and disturb these resting grounds no longer."

"Peter, did you hear that too?" the king of the underground says, as we're all temporarily frozen in place, unsure of what to do. "Who contacted us just now? Was it the ether?"

"Didn't want to do what?..." I say, but then I immediately find out what he meant, as my body in the earthen plane gets zapped with a powerful electrical current.

 If I didn't have my aura hardening stat maxed, I would have probably fainted by now. That being said, he's probably not going to cancel his spell until he sees me lose my consciousness, so I think I might need to do a little bit of acting, here.

"...Is he dead?" I hear the king of the underground asking on the ethereal plane, while I still have my eyes closed.

Before the king gets to finish what he had to say, I shoot Peter with the same lightning spell that I used at the beginning of the battle, catching him completely off-guard.

As Peter's illusory manticores are now all disappearing, I fly over to the king, so that I can finally give Flower a helping hand.

"Flower, are you ready?" I say, once I get closer to her and the king. "Let's attack him together on the count of three!"

"Attack him?" Flower asks. "But what about the voice in our heads? It warned us not to--"

"Listen, I didn't survive the Magium twice just to let myself be intimidated by the likes of this... personification of the ethereal plane, or whatever that voice was supposed to be," I say. "If the ether was patient enough to let us take the fight this far, then I'm sure it can wait one more minute for us to bring a proper end to it. The king of the underground is the only one left. Let's finish him off quick, before we get kicked out of here."

 "You are making a mistake..." the king of the underground tells us.

"We'll see about that," I say. "Flower, let's go!"

"Umm, okay... sure!" Flower says, and then she shoots a fire beam at the king, as I'm using another electric attack, to put more pressure on him.

While we are attacking the king of the underground, I feel my consciousness being sent back to the earthen plane a few more times, but this time things are happening a little differently. Instead of switching perspectives between the two planes of existence, I am beginning to become aware of my surroundings in both planes simultaneously. The only other occasion when I experienced something similar to this was when the Magium tried to erase me and Leila from existence in the seredium tower.

For now, my main consciousness still seems to be in the ethereal plane, but at the same time I am also in control of my real body from the earthen plane, except that it doesn't really feel like my body at the moment. It feels more like some kind of... puppet... that I'm controlling with invisible strings.

 Come to think of it, I remember Flower saying the same thing about her own body on the earthen plane. That it feels like she's controlling a puppet. Could this be how Flower has been living her life this whole time?

While I am busy contemplating my own existence, I suddenly detect the king of the underground walking up to me on the earthen plane, as I am still lying face-first on the ground in the middle of a puddle.

"It looks like your luck may have finally run out," the king of the underground tells me, and then I begin to feel a powerful pressure forming on top of me.

 Right before he gets to pin me to the ground with his aura manipulation, the king gets an intense headache and the invisible force above me disappears completely. When I switch my focus to the ethereal plane to see what happened, I realize that the Overseer has now also joined the fight, likely because the king was no longer able to keep him contained after all of the back and forth between the two planes of existence affected his concentration.

Instead of engaging him in the material world, I prefer to fly away from him and to focus on defeating him in the non-material plane of existence where I have the upper hand. As Flower, the Overseer and I cast our spells at the king all at once, we can clearly see that his barriers can no longer keep up, and surely enough, a few moments later we manage to break through all of his defenses. One last lightning bolt from me is all it takes to make the king faint, which causes him to lose his consciousness on the earthen plane as well.

Taking a look at Peter and the king's unconscious bodies that are floating in the ether, a sudden thought occurs to me. If I were to kill them right now, in this place, there would be no evidence on the earthen plane to point towards me being the murderer. Most of the rebels would probably just assume that they died as a result of the Overseer's soul displacement technique. If I actually wanted them dead, there would be no better opportunity than this to rid myself of them.

 After being unconscious for some time, I begin to vaguely hear the voices of the king of the underground and Peter, who both sound rather tense. When I try to wake up, I realize that I can't move my body at all and even my eyes won't open. It feels like I'm only half-awake right now, with my mind still trying to decide if what I'm hearing is really happening, or if it's all just a dream.

"We can't just leave them here, damn it!" the king of the underground says. "They're going to get killed at this rate."

"With all due respect, sir... why do you care so much about what happens to them?" Peter says. "They betrayed us and our cause. They allied themselves with the Overseer. What obligation do we have to save their lives?"

"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need," the king of the underground says. "At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!"

"As you wish, my lord," Peter says. "But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it."

Shortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while. The silence doesn't last for long, however, because it soon gets replaced with the sound of Flower shouting in my ear, while she is shaking me violently.

The invisible force above me pins me against the ground, making it impossible for me to move anything other than my head and neck. As I am struggling to break free from the aura manipulation technique, I feel the equivalent of an invisible rock being smashed into the back of my head, likely also as a result of the king's aura technique.

 Since the blow was too powerful for me to withstand, I quickly lost my consciousness, which made me faint in the ethereal world as well.

As I am struggling to break free from the aura manipulation technique, I feel the equivalent of an invisible rock being smashed into the back of my head, likely also as a result of the king's aura technique.

The blow was powerful, but not strong enough to knock me out, thanks to all of the levels that I put into my toughness stat. When the king sees that I'm still awake, he tries to hit me one more time with a more powerful strike, but he gets stopped by two long water whips that coil themselves around his arms and pull him back.

As soon as the invisible force above me gets weakened, I manage to free myself and I fly away to a place that is outside the king's range of attack.

"My apologies for the late intervention," Illuna tells me in a loud voice, as she is still holding the king in place with her whips. "I wasn't expecting you two to be returning to the earthen plane so soon."

 "We're still not done fighting in the ethereal plane," I tell her. "It's just that we're conscious in both planes of existence for the time being. Can you keep holding him like that while we continue our fight in the other realm?"

"...No," Illuna says, as she watches the king easily destroying her whips with an explosion of his aura. "But I can keep him somewhat distracted, if that's what you need."

She then jumps further back from the king and she throws two large snakes made of water on the ground, which quickly slither their way towards him and attempt to coil themselves around him. When the king of the underground destroys these snakes too, they shatter into a million water droplets which then regroup back into their original serpent forms and once again start to attack him.

As expected, the king is having a hard time defending himself on both planes of existence at the same time, and eventually his barriers from the ethereal plane give out under the pressure of our relentless attacks. One last lightning bolt from me is all it takes to make the king faint, which causes him to lose his consciousness on the earthen plane as well.

Please refrain from taking such rash actions in the future if you do not want to put any more unnecessary strain on our already fragile alliance."

 They're both our enemies. They need to be killed. I'm sure they would have done the same thing to us if given the chance.

"Phew!" Flower says, as she is now using her fire jets to fly closer to me. "I almost thought we weren't gonna make it, for a second there... Nice work, Barry!"

While Flower was talking, I was busy conjuring two large stone plates on opposite sides of the king of the underground's head, positioning them approximately six feet away from him in both directions. Once I was done with that, I did the same thing for Peter, with two additional stone plates.

"Umm, Barry?..." Flower asks, looking a little nervous. "What are you planning to do with those rocks?..."

I ignore Flower and I raise my hands, taking control of both pairs of stone plates at the same time. Then, before Flower has the time to say anything else, I clap my hands as hard as I can and the two pairs of stone plates close in on each other at breathtaking speeds, turning the heads of both rebels into a thick red paste upon collision.

"NO!!!" Flower shouts, as she instinctively flies towards the dead bodies, even if she probably already realized that there's nothing she can do to help them anymore.

She cancels her fire jets a few seconds later when she comes back to her senses, and then she just stares at the lifeless bodies in front of her for a short while before she speaks again.

 "You killed them..." Flower says, looking as if she were still trying to accept the reality in front of her. "Why?..."

"They were too dangerous to be left alive," I say. "I had no choice."

"No choice?..." Flower says, incredulous. "They were both unconscious! We could have easily captured them!"

"Captured them how?" I ask. "Both of them could use powerful techniques without moving, so it's not like we could have just tied them up."

"I don't know!" Flower says. "We could have asked the Overseer to put them in an anti-magic prison cell or something! Wasn't that one of the main reasons why we allied ourselves with him?"

"It would have been too risky," I say. "We barely managed to beat them this one time. If they escaped from their cells, there was no guarantee that we could have beaten them again. Killing them was the only way to make sure that we wouldn't need to fight them anymore."

"Uhh... yeah!" I say. "I think I do, actually. But I'm not completely sure if it's the right place.

 A white light that is different from the one that makes up the ether envelops me and Flower, and then we both get teleported to a different location that looks exactly the same as the previous one. As I look around the endless sea of light to see if I can spot any large cubes, I suddenly feel the force that was pulling me back towards my sanctuary getting magnified a hundredfold.

"Okay, we're definitely closer, but I'm still not seeing the cube," I tell Flower. "I can feel myself being pulled in the same direction as before, but now it's as if an elephant is the one trying to drag me away, not a small dog."

"An elephant..." Flower says. "That means your sanctuary should be relatively close. Let's keep flying in that direction until we--"

As Flower is talking, her voice is getting gradually drowned out by the millions of voices that are now flooding my mind, along with rapidly changing images that are flashing in front of my eyes at too high of a speed for me to be able to tell what they are about.

The voices are all overlapping, but they're mostly just using different words to say the same thing:

 'Leave this place!'

'Get out!'

'You do not belong here.'

I try to cover my ears, but it doesn't have any effect. The voices are all coming from inside my head, and they're only getting louder. After fifteen more seconds of this, the images stop flashing and my consciousness begins to drift in and out between the ethereal and earthen plane again. As I am still struggling to regain my composure, the voices all stop at the same time. All except for one: the voice that I'd heard while we were still fighting Peter and the king of the underground.

'You had been warned,' the voice tells me simply, and then my consciousness flips back and forth between both planes of existence for a thousand times in a single second, while it feels like my soul is being ripped by force from my body. 

It's getting cold. So very cold. My thoughts are all a jumble. An extreme fatigue is now taking over me as it feels like the very essence of my being is slowly fading away, along with my imagined body from the ethereal plane, which is becoming more transparent with each passing moment.

"--arry!" I hear Flower's voice as if it were some distant memory. "Barry, look into my eyes! Look at me! Barry!!!"

 With what seems to be the last remaining ounce of my willpower, I manage to focus my gaze upon Flower, who is currently holding me by the shoulders while her flaming red eyes are shining brighter than ever before. Getting a better look at her, I see that not only her eyes are aflame, but her entire body is now made up entirely of fire... Or rather, the kind of fire that feels hot but for some reason is not burning me, even though she is touching me directly with it.

"Barry, I need you to think of what it was like inside the cube," Flower says, loudly. "I need you to visualize it clearly inside your head. Do you understand?"

"Yes..." I say, with my voice barely louder than a whisper.

Just like she asked, I try to remember every small detail that I can from the place called my 'sanctuary', and then I recreate it inside my head. I then close my eyes, so that I can see the image in my mind more clearly.

"I'm imagining it now..." I tell Flower, in the same weak voice as before.

 "Do you have a clear image of it?" Flower says, in a panicky voice. "Are you certain?"

"Yes, yes," I tell her with my eyes still closed. "I'm looking at it as I'm speaking to you. What do I do now?"

I can no longer see my body from the ethereal plane because my eyes are closed, but I can tell that it's only gotten more transparent since I've started talking to Flower. I wonder how many more seconds I have left to live?...

"--arry!" Flower says, as I'm beginning to drift in and out of consciousness, catching only bits and pieces of what she is saying to me. "Listen-- me carefully-- no time-- no matter what-- open your eyes! Do-- hear me?! Barry-- losing you! Barry!!!"

 It is hard to tell with my eyes still closed, but I think I'm being enveloped by the white light from Flower's teleporting spell again. Is she trying to send me back to my sanctuary? Is that why she asked me to imagine it inside my head?

As I continue to visualize the empty cube in my mind's eye, the bright light from both the teleportation spell and the ether disappears, and the only thing I can see through my eyelids is complete darkness. Does this mean that the teleportation was successful? I can't tell whether my body is back to normal or not. Aside from the light disappearing, I still feel weak, and it doesn't seem like much has changed.

The silence around me is deafening. The anticipation is killing me. Did I get teleported properly or not? I have to know!

 I open my eyes, but to my surprise it is not only the light that is gone from around me, but also everything else. The only thing that I'm seeing before my eyes is pure darkness.

"Flower, are you there?" I try to say, but my words do not leave my mouth.

After trying to talk a few more times, the weakness and fatigue slowly take over me and soon I don't even have the strength to open my mouth anymore. Several seconds later, I find myself closing my eyes again, but this time I lose my consciousness for good.

 Just as I'm about to open my eyes, I remember Flower's warning from before she teleported me.

"--no matter what-- open your eyes!" were the words I heard her saying.

The phrase is not complete, but based on the structure of the sentence it feels like she was saying something along the lines of "no matter what, don't open your eyes".

I can't be sure of this, but she did tell me that I should keep visualizing the cube, and she never told me when to stop. I still have the image of the cube in front of me right now, so I guess I should probably keep thinking of it. This is the only thing I should be worrying about. Nothing else matters. Just keep imagining the cube.

A whole minute passes without me doing anything other than concentrating on the image of the sanctuary which I have in my head. Or at least I think it's been a minute. It's kind of hard to keep track of time in this complete darkness.

It's fine. There's no need to open my eyes. I'm still conscious for now, and this is all that matters. A minute ago, I could have sworn that I only had a few seconds left to live, but somehow I'm still here. I'm still awake. Whatever Flower did, it must have had at least some positive effect, or else I wouldn't be alive.

 As I'm still waiting for something to happen, I suddenly feel myself being drenched from head to toe in freezing cold water, and when I instinctively jump up, I quickly realize that there is now ground beneath my feet, and it no longer feels like I'm floating in an endless darkness like before. The rain is pouring down my cheeks, a sound of lightning echoes in the distance, and the wind is still blowing, although not as hard as it did at the beginning of the storm.

Is this it?... Am I finally back on the earthen plane for good?

"Are you planning to open your eyes anytime soon, or are you expecting me to talk to you like this?..." I hear Flower's voice, speaking in Illuna's tone.

When I finally open my eyelids, I see that Flower is standing before me with flaming eyes in this plane of existence as well, except that the flames are blue, because Illuna is the one who is talking. Her body is not made up of flames like in the ethereal plane, however.

Every connection that I had with the ethereal plane is now gone. Even though I'm trying to switch my consciousness to the other realm, it's not working anymore. Could this be the result of my soul finally returning to my sanctuary on the ethereal plane?

 "There was this... darkness," I tell Illuna. "It felt similar to the void that the Magium made me float around in when it almost erased me from the world, except this time I still had my memories and my identity left intact. Wait, no, that's not right... There was also something else different about this... nothingness that I was in. I didn't really get to see it because I had my eyes closed the whole time, but the darkness around me seemed almost... oppressive. Like it was trying to swallow me whole. Do you have any idea what might have happened?"

"Ah, so that's what Flower did," Illuna says. "I had some pretty strong suspicions, but I could barely get any kind of coherent information out of her through our telepathic link when I talked to her earlier. I should probably let her know that she didn't end up killing you by accident before she gives herself a heart attack out of pure anxiety."

"She thought she might have killed me?..." I ask, in an uneasy tone. "Wait, what did she do?"

Instead of answering me, Illuna raises two fingers in the air in front of me, signaling me to be quiet while she talks to Flower telepathically in the ethereal plane. Once she is done, she lowers her hand so that we can resume our conversation.

 While I'm busy looking for any kind of bindings to restrain the unconscious rebels with, several dozen red-eyed drones suddenly swarm the area out of nowhere, with long metal prongs coming out of their lower sides which they are using to hold some stretchers. Once they lower their altitudes, the drones keep holding the stretchers from both sides, while other drones help to lift the rebels onto them. As soon as a rebel has been successfully placed on a stretcher, the two drones that are holding the stretcher lift it into the air and leave the plaza, while new drones with additional stretchers join in so that they can take away the rest of the underground king's troops.

"The Overseer protocol will handle things from here," a red-eyed drone says, as it descends somewhere close to me. "Thank you for your cooperation. The Overseer protocol would also like to issue a formal apology to your group for accidentally teleporting your souls outside of your minds from the ethereal plane. Unfortunately, the technique that was used was still experimental, and it ended up affecting the whole area of the battlefield instead of only the rebels. If you are in need of any assistance or you wish to discuss more details about your alliance with the Overseer, including his future plans for Ollendor, a green-eyed drone will be waiting for you inside the palace. Have a nice day!"

"Hey wait, where are you taking the rebels?" I say, but the red-eyed drone does not seem to be smart enough to answer any questions, so it simply flies away and leaves the plaza after having delivered its message.

 "Okay, Flower has calmed down for now," Illuna says. "What were we talking about again? Oh right, the darkness. Well, there's not much to say about it, really. Darkness is the absence of light. The light from the ethereal plane is the ether itself. The ether was the one attacking you, so Flower decided to teleport you in the only place where you'd be truly safe from it. However, the only way to get yourself out of the ethereal abyss is by imagining a place very clearly in your head, and being firmly convinced that you can transport yourself there through your own powers. Seeing that you were no longer breathing on the earthen plane, I assumed that you had failed at your task, so I had to get a little creative."

She then holds out her palm and conjures a floating sphere of water above it, hinting that she was the reason why the water that I was drenched in was three times colder than the rain drops from the storm.

"Wow..." I tell her. "I don't know what to say. Thank you. And Flower. I have no idea what would have happened if you two hadn't intervened the way you did. How did you even come up with these ideas?"

"...Experience," Illuna says. "And a little bit of ingenuity. Let's just say that this isn't the first time when we've had to make use of the ethereal abyss, and it probably won't be the last either. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to check up on Flower. There are still a few matters left unresolved in the ethereal plane that we need to take care of."

"Wait, is Flower okay?" I ask. "I can't switch my consciousness back to the ethereal plane to check. Did she manage to escape from the ether?"

 "Flower is... fine," Illuna says. "For now, at least. I'm not entirely certain, but it's possible that her recent transformation is shielding her from the ether in some way. It is a little hard to speculate without knowing any more details about this new form of hers. Anyway, I'll be right back."

As Illuna turns her focus back to the ethereal plane, leaving Flower's body to look in front of her with an empty stare, I decide to take a little walk around the battlefield, to see what the situation is.

It feels strange to not be able to see the perspective of my soul from the ethereal plane anymore, after everything that's happened. Even though I know for a fact that all the things I've experienced on that plane of existence were real, I still can't shake off the feeling that I've only just woken up from a very long dream. 

I wish I could have explored that world more. I wish I could have tested my spells more. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to see that place again...

 The drones are very diligent workers. Thanks to their faultless organization, they manage to empty the plaza of bodies in less than five minutes. By the time the drones and rebels are gone, Flower is finally done returning all of my friends' souls to their sanctuaries in the ethereal plane, and now that they've woken up on the earthen plane, they are slowly gathering around me and Illuna.

"Are you sure that's what the red-eyed drone said?" Daren asks me, after I explain to him what happened to all the unconscious rebels on the ground.

"Yeah, it was pretty clear in its wording," I tell Daren. "If we want to talk to the Overseer, we need to go to the palace."

"I don't remember this being part of our original agreement with him..." Daren says.

"We never really agreed that we wouldn't meet him at the palace either," I say. "Technically speaking, he's not breaking his word."

"Hmm..." Daren says. "I'm not sure how much I like this. He could have easily sent a green-eyed drone to talk to us, but instead he's making us go all the way there. This feels like he's trying to show us who's really in control, here."

"I mean... is he really wrong, though?" I say. "He's clearly in a superior bargaining position at this point. All major threats to him in this city are now gone. We are practically the only ones left who can still somewhat challenge him."

The last thing we'd want is to have to fight them again on the earthen plane. Especially the king."

"Well, I don't think the king and Peter will need any help to get back to their minds after they wake up in the ethereal plane, but I'll try to save Albert for last, like you said!" Flower tells Daren.

"Good," Daren says. "So, is everyone ready?"

"Aye," Hadrik's voice echoes the loudest, as the rest of us also confirm at the same time.

"Thanks, Melindra!" Flower says, as she is now being lifted in the air by some of Melindra's air currents. "Sorry for asking this of you out of the blue, but Petal wants to avoid moving my body herself as much as possible until I find a way to, um... turn off the red flames in my eyes."

"It's fine, don't worry," Melindra says. "You just want me to carry you like this until we reach the palace, right?"

"Yes, please," Flower says. "Right now, I'm a little busy guiding the rebels from the ether back to their own sanctuaries, so I can't afford to cancel the transformation yet."

"...You're helping the rebels?" Hadrik asks, confused.

"Well, I can't just let them all die out there!" Flower says.

 Just as I am about to head towards the castle myself, I get a sudden dizziness, and for a split second it feels like my consciousness is drifting away again into the ethereal plane, where I get a direct view of the inside of my empty cube that is supposed to be my sanctuary. What just happened? Did I really switch back to my perspective from the ethereal plane for a second there, or am I just imagining things?

"You alright, Barry?" Hadrik says, when he sees me frozen in place at the back of the group, and sweating something fierce.

"You didn't... feel anything just now?" I ask Hadrik, as I'm trying to calm myself down.

"What do you mean?" Hadrik asks. "What was I supposed to feel?"

"...Nothing," I tell him. "I'm sure it was nothing. Let's get going. We need to catch up to the others."

As Hadrik nods and then goes on ahead of me, I stand there in place for a few more seconds, contemplating on what just happened.

 A fluke. It has to have been a fluke. Hadrik didn't experience anything unusual, so we're not being targeted by the Overseer again. Even if what I saw was real, I was clearly sitting inside my sanctuary, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I'm not going to get kicked out into the ether again.

After the brief pause, I decide that there's no point in dwelling on this any further, and I quicken my pace so that I can rejoin the rest of the group. For the next hour or so, as we journey towards the palace, the sensation of switching my focus towards the ethereal plane does not return to me, so I don't bring it up to any of my friends. Everything is fine. There is nothing to worry about. If it didn't happen again after so much time, then I'm sure it was nothing serious and the event will never repeat itself.

Everything is fine.

After a fierce battle in the ethereal plane, Barry and his friends finally managed to defeat the king of the underground and Peter. Once the battle was over, the Overseer's drones carried all of the unconscious rebels away from the battlefield, in order to lock them in a prison.

However, instead of sending a green-eyed drone to talk to Barry and his team, the Overseer summoned them all to the royal palace, without giving them any other options to contact him.

Reluctantly, Barry and the others started heading towards the Ollendor castle, so that they could have one last discussion with the Overseer about his plans of ruling the city, now that the rebels no longer posed a problem for him.
