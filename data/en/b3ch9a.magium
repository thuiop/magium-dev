"Albert, you're back," the king of the underground says. "What news do you bring?"

"You were right about the storm," Albert says, as he is entering the building we're hiding in, with his cloak drenched in water. "The flying metal balls are having a difficult time moving through the strong wind, and they're having significant problems with their maneuverability."

"Ah, so their propellers must indeed be powered by rudimentary air spells, just like I thought," the king of the underground says. "It would have made no sense for the lessathi who initially built these 'drones' to give them the ability to cast complex air current spells around themselves just for the rare occasions when they would be caught in a storm. Am I saying the name correctly? Is it pronounced 'drones'?"

"Yes, that's what Billy Bob used to call them," I tell him.

"My king," Peter says, "while I do understand the tactical advantages of engaging our enemy when it is in a weakened state, do you not think it would have been wise to wait until more of our troops were ready to join the battle?"

 "Summer storms in Varathia are highly unpredictable," the king of the underground says. "There really is no way to tell in advance how long they will last. An opportunity like this is too valuable to pass up, even if it means going into battle a little less prepared than we would have hoped."

"Is Breynan done teleporting everyone?" Albert says, as he looks around, counting the people in the room. "I'm still not seeing Herman or Howard. Will they be joining us after all or not?"

"Howard will not be coming with us," the king of the underground says. "His wound from yesterday had reopened right after you teleported to the surface, despite all the healing he's received, so I was forced to ask him to stay behind."

"That is... unfortunate," Albert says. "I know how much he wanted to be a part of the final mission to liberate Ollendor, so I can only imagine how tough it must be for him to get cast aside like this. What about Herman?"

 "Herman will be teleporting with the next batch of people, which should be here soon," the king of the underground says. "I told Breynan to wait a few minutes after each teleportation, in order to avoid overheating the device. The last thing we'd want right now is to cause a malfunction in our teleporting device and leave ourselves stranded here, especially after our main technician has been imprisoned for treason."

"Will Breynan not be joining us, my lord?" asks one of the mages that teleported to the surface together with us.

"No," the king of the underground says. "I've asked Breynan to remain underground, because if he were to come with us as well, there would be nobody left to lead our people in case anything went wrong with our mission. I know that you are a member of his usual team and are not used to going on surface expeditions without his guidance, but you are one of our most competent fighters, so we really needed to have you with us today. I trust that you will handle yourself well even without your mentor, and that you will make him proud of your achievements."

"Yes, sir," the mage says. "I will!"

 Just as the mage is done talking, a bright light fills the abandoned storage building that we are in, and a group of twenty or so people are now being teleported into the large room.

"Is this the last group?" Peter asks, once the teleportation is complete.

"I believe so," the king of the underground says. "Aside from Howard, everyone seems to have arrived."

He then raises his voice to make sure that all the people in the room can hear him.

"May I have your attention, please?" the king of the underground says.

The background noise from all the people who were talking over each other is now slowly fading out, as the men from the underground are waiting for their leader's speech before the final battle with bated breath.

 "I'll keep this brief," the king of the underground says. "I know that you all want this to end. I know that you've been waiting for this day for many years. The day when Ollendor finally becomes free... Well, right now the only thing that stands between us and that freedom is the Overseer. He is the sole remnant of an age of tyranny and repression that has claimed many lives of our brothers and sisters. But that ends today! Today we will claim back what is rightfully ours. Today, we take back Ollendor!"

The king of the underground lets his men cheer for a few seconds, but then he raises his hands in the air, signaling them to stop.

"Does everyone know what they need to do?" he asks.

"Yes, my lord," we hear a few of the warriors say, as the others are also nodding their heads in agreement.

"Then let us proceed," the king says. "Our destination is not much further from this building. We will make sure to take out as many of the drones as we can on our way there. May the gods be with us!"

 "Are you alright, Jack?" Albert says to the young mage who asked about Breynan earlier, while putting a hand on his shoulder.

"Uhm, y-- yes sir!" Jack says.

"Look," Albert says, "I know I'm not Breynan, but if you need help out there on the battlefield you can count on me, okay?"

"O-- of course!" Jack says. "I promise I won't let you down, sir!"

"Good luck!" Albert says, and then he walks past him to join the king of the underground.

Instead of following him, Jack takes out a pendant from his pocket, he looks at it for a few seconds and then he clutches it firmly with both his hands while closing his eyes.

 "Having second thoughts, Barry?" Daren asks me in a low voice, as he sees me looking at Jack while he leaves.

It takes me a few moments to understand that what he's referring to is our decision to betray the king of the underground and side with the Overseer. I take a look around to make sure that nobody is watching us, and then I answer him in a whisper.

"No," I say. "I mean, it's not like we're going to get them all killed, right? They'll still come back with us to the underground after everything is said and done."

"It depends on how the battle will go," Daren says. "But we'll try to keep the casualties to a minimum."

What do you say?"

 "How big of a delay are we talking about, here?" I say.

"I don't know... one or two seconds?" Melindra says. "Maybe more? It depends on my reaction time and a few other things. Like for example if you are in my field of view or not. Or if I'm being attacked and can't pay attention to you."

"Yeah, I wasn't expecting it either," Daren says. "I told Kelrim to stick with Breynan at all times while we're gone, just to be on the safe side, but I don't think there's any point in having him killed while he's still underground. It would raise too much suspicion from everyone."

 "You would still retain partial control over the currents," Melindra says, "but they would be less responsive, and you might have to repeat the same movements a few times until they work. I can still cast the usual version of the spell on you if you want, which would give you full control, but that would make it about as unreliable as piloting a gnomish flying contraption in the middle of a hurricane. I'm not sure if you get what I mean."

"Hey, I've piloted a plane in a storm before," I say. "It's not that bad! I mean, I nearly died like ten times during the same flight, but I did land safely in the end."

"As you wish," Melindra says, and then she points her hands towards me, to help her concentrate on the invisible flow of magical energy coming out of her fingertips while she is casting her spell.

A few seconds later, I start to feel the familiar sensation of the air flowing around me in an unnatural way, reacting to every slight movement of my body. As usual, the currents are very weak at the beginning, because they are waiting for me to raise my arms in the air to signal the start of my flight.

"It's been a little while since the king of the underground and his men left the building," Leila writes, as she is looking around the large empty room that we are standing in. "Should we maybe go outside to see what's happening?"

As I begin to feel the air flowing around me, I immediately recognize the difference between these currents and the ones she normally uses on me, because they are not automatically following every slight movement of my body. I hope I won't find it too difficult to get used to this new way of flying while I'm also busy fighting against the storm.

 "No," Daren says. "The king explicitly told us to wait here while they set up their defenses for the battle against the drones. He said that he doesn't want the Overseer to be aware of our presence initially, so that he'll miscalculate the number of drones that he needs to send to deal with his enemies."

"Or maybe the king of the underground simply doesn't trust us, and that was just an excuse to keep us from joining the battle," Kate says.

"If he doesn't want us to fight alongside them, then it's their loss," Daren says. "I don't think that's the case, though. I say we wait for a few more minutes and if we still don't hear a word from them, we'll take a peek outside to see what's going on."

 Just like Daren said, it didn't take long until one of the underground troops came to the door to announce that the king was expecting us. We all headed outside together and then we followed the king of the underground's envoy for about twenty seconds through the raging storm, until we reached the place where all of the underground forces were stationed. There were about a hundred men here, give or take, and judging by their auras, only about ten or so were mages. Of course, I couldn't be completely sure of that, since the king of the underground and Peter are always suppressing the magic from their auras, so there could be others doing the same thing.

Some of the mages were still casting protection spells on the area when we arrived, while the warriors were just standing with their crossbows, swords and shields at the ready, looking anxiously at the drones in the sky that were minding their own business, simply ignoring the armed fighters that were waiting in the middle of an open plaza, during a city-wide quarantine.

"Make way, please," the king of the underground says to his men, when he sees us approaching him. "I wish to speak to them."

 The warriors and the mages all step aside, leaving enough space for me and my friends to walk through, while the only two people who do not leave the king's side are as always, Peter and Albert. As he is speaking, the king of the underground is forced to use a loud voice, to make sure that we can properly hear him despite the noise that the wind is making.

"I'm going to skip the pleasantries and ask you all directly," the king of the underground tells us, once we stop in front of him. "What do you think of our current situation?"

"You mean why the drones haven't attacked you, yet?" Daren says. "I don't know... maybe they're just waiting to see what your first move is?"

 "That would be one way to interpret this, of course," the king says, "but I've sent a few scouts ahead to check, and I've been informed that there aren't even any drones trying to approach our current location. One would have thought that the Overseer would at least try to ready some of his forces for the upcoming conflict, even if he's not planning to make the first move. However, the drones seem to be ignoring us completely, and I can't help but wonder what is causing such an unusual behavio--"

"Your highness, are you there?" we hear a man's voice, coming through a transceiver that the king of the underground was keeping strapped to his belt.

"I can hear you," the king says, after he taps the transceiver once. "Tell me, what is it?"

"It was just as you predicted, my king!" the man says. "The flying metal balls started slowly advancing towards your position shortly after the outsiders exited the abandoned storage building! They must have been scheming together with the Overseer this whole time. There's no doubt about it!"

 As we begin to hear an uneasy murmur coming from the men gathered around us, the king of the underground lightly slaps his own forehead with his right palm.

"And what did I tell you to do if something like this were to occur, Gregory?" the king says, to the man from the transceiver.

"Uh... you told me... to wait until you call me, because you wanted to first hear what the outsiders had to say in their defense," Gregory says. "I'm sorry, my lord. I... got ahead of myself. But this proves their guilt, surely! There should be no need to listen to what they have to say any longer."

"That is for me to decide, Gregory, not you," the king of the underground says. "This will be all for now. Please return to your post. I will be closing this channel."

He then taps the transceiver in order to interrupt his conversation with Gregory, like he said.

"Well?..." the king asks us, after he sees us just standing there in silence for a few seconds. "Is there anything you want to say to us?"

 "Don't you think the two of you are jumping to conclusions just a little bit?" I say. "From what you said, it sounds like the Overseer was simply waiting to see if we would join the fight as well, so that he could know how many drones to send to fight us."

"I see that you are still trying to hide the fact that you've been communicating secretly with the Overseer through the blue crystals in the underground base," the king says. "It is difficult for me to think of a reason for this other than you conspiring with him against us..."

He knows about our conversations with the Overseer? Could it be that one of his men overheard us when we were talking about it in the tunnels?

"Wait, wait!" Daren says. "It's true that we were contacted by the Overseer, and he wanted us to help him ambush you, but we refused his offer!"

"If that were the case," the king of the underground says, "I don't see why your friend would not have mentioned this from the start, instead of trying to convince us that we don't have any reasons to be suspicious of you."

"Okay, I admit that we haven't been entirely sincere with you, but neither have you," Daren says. "The Overseer played a recording for us where you told Albert to deal with us 'discreetly' if we wouldn't agree with you being crowned as the new king of Ollendor. Surely, you can see how this would cause us to have some trust issues regarding you and your group?"

 "Ah, I see now what is going on," the king of the underground says. "I cannot fault you for your actions, if this is indeed what you've heard. Seeing as how we do not have much time, I will choose to trust your words for now, and we will revisit this conversation later, once we are all out of here safely."

He then taps his transceiver, so that he can talk to his scout.

"Gregory, how long until the flying metal balls reach us?" the king of the underground says.

"Uh... they should be there any minute, my lord," Gregory says.

"Perfect," the king says. "Let's give them an easy target to shoot at, then."

After saying this, the king of the underground raises his arms and then he begins  to slowly rise into the air, as a bolt of lightning from the storm can be seen striking somewhere in the distance.

"He can fly?!" Hadrik asks.

"I actually got this idea from your friend, Barry," the king of the underground shouts loudly from above, answering Hadrik's question.

"I think I've heard enough," the king of the underground says, as my friends remain quiet. "Albert, Peter, make sure to keep an eye on them. If it looks like they're trying anything, don't hesitate to neutralize them. In the meantime, I'll go deal with the drones."

 He then does a few dashes through the air, and he appears to lose control for about a second due to the strong wind, before quickly regaining his balance.

"The controls are a little crude, but I can make a few adjustments with my aura manipulation, so it's not that big of a problem," the king says. "Now, then... where are the drones?"

As the king of the underground flies higher into the sky, it is getting harder to see him because of the heavy rain, but it does not take long for the Overseer's drones to take the bait and to light up the whole area around the king with their bright red eyes.

The king of the underground does not engage them, and he instead makes a semi-transparent spherical barrier around himself, made up of hardened aura, which is protecting him both from the drones' magical attacks and from the downpour of rain. More and more drones are now flocking around the king's barrier, trying to break it with elemental attacks of all types.

The king of the underground keeps baiting the drones for another minute or so, until about a hundred or more of them are surrounding him, and just as we are about to lose sight of him due to the high number of metal balls swarming him from all directions, the king unleashes a shockwave so powerful that it makes all of the drones around him explode at once.

"Albert, is he telling the truth?" the king asks.

"It would appear so, my king," Albert says.

"And why is it that you are only telling us this now?" the king of the underground says. "How exactly do you expect us to leave our backs open to you while we are battling together when you are willing to hide such important details from us?"

"Hey, hey, let's not get ahead of ourselves, here," Daren says. "It's true that we've been hiding some things, but the same goes for you! When we talked to the Overseer, he played a recording for us where you told Albert to deal with us 'discretely' if we wouldn't agree with you being crowned as the new king of Ollendor.

 He then taps his transceiver, so that he can talk to his scout.

"Gregory, how long until the flying metal balls reach us?" the king of the underground says.

"Uh... they should be there any minute, my lord," Gregory says.

"Perfect," the king says. "Let's give them an easy target to shoot at, then."

After saying this, the king of the underground raises his arms and then he begins  to slowly rise into the air, as a bolt of lightning from the storm can be seen striking somewhere in the distance.

"He can fly?!" Hadrik asks.

"I actually got this idea from your friend, Barry," the king of the underground shouts loudly from above, answering Hadrik's question. "I heard from my men about the air current spell he was using to fly around, and I asked my air elementalists if they couldn't come up with something similar to what Melindra had been casting."

 He then does a few dashes through the air, and he appears to lose control for about a second due to the strong wind, before quickly regaining his balance.

"The controls are a little crude, but I can make a few adjustments with my aura manipulation, so it's not that big of a problem," the king says. "Now, then... where are the drones?"

As the king of the underground flies higher into the sky, it is getting harder to see him because of the heavy rain, but it does not take long for the Overseer's drones to take the bait and to light up the whole area around the king with their bright red eyes.

The king of the underground does not engage them, and he instead makes a semi-transparent spherical barrier around himself, made up of hardened aura, which is protecting him both from the drones' magical attacks and from the downpour of rain. More and more drones are now flocking around the king's barrier, trying to break it with elemental attacks of all types.

The king of the underground keeps baiting the drones for another minute or so, until about a hundred or more of them are surrounding him, and just as we are about to lose sight of him due to the high number of metal balls swarming him from all directions, the king unleashes a shockwave so powerful that it makes all of the drones around him explode at once.

 "Watch out!" Daren shouts to us, as dozens of flaming metal carcasses are dropping on top of us and all of the king's men are running around frantically, trying to avoid getting hit by them.

As we step aside from the falling metal balls, we see a new wave of drones quickly approaching the king, while a few dozen other drones are moving in to attack the troops on the ground.

"Let's take care of the drones close to the ground first, and then we can go help the king," I say. "He looks like he can handle himself just fine on his own for now."

"We're not going anywhere," Daren says. "Did you already forget about the little joke you made to the king earlier? Everyone thinks we're allied with the Overseer now. There's no way they'll let us help them."

"Hey, no matter what they think of us, they can't possibly object to us killing enemy drones, right?" I say. "It's in their best interest to let us destroy them."

 I then turn towards Peter, who has been observing us carefully this whole time, with a frown on his face, and his arms crossed.

"How about it, Peter?" I say. "You won't mind if we take care of a few of these drones, will you?"

Peter does not answer me, and he keeps staring at me with the same frown as before.

"See?" I tell Daren. "He doesn't mind. Now come on, let's go!"

We walk past Peter, while he is still making sure to not let us out of his sight, and then we begin to fight some of the drones that have not reached the rebels yet. We do not get to do that for long, however, because the drones start to act very strangely all of a sudden, flying up in the air and spinning in place while the light from their eyes is blinking constantly.

He then shoves one of the king of the underground's men to the ground with his shield and starts fighting the others, as my friends prepare to follow his lead.

Just as everyone is about to start fighting, Kate's whole body begins to tremble violently all of a sudden while she is arching her back, and then she falls to the ground, unconscious.

My first instinct is to hurry to her side and see if she's still alive, but then I quickly realize what must have happened. There was nobody behind her when she was attacked, so it must have been Albert who used an electric weapon of some kind to shock her while he was invisible. I have to tell the others about this.

"Guys!" I shout. "Albert is hiding invisibly with an electric weapon! Don't let him get you!"

 "Is that what happened to Kate?" Hadrik says, as he carefully advances towards her to see if she's still breathing. "Where is he hiding? I may not be able to hurt him because he's a local, but I can still grab him and hold him in place for the rest of you."

"I don't know where he is," I say. "Just be on the lookout, okay? And always watch your back!"

"Well, Kate is alive," Hadrik says, once he gets closer to her. "She just collapsed. I wouldn't try to wake her up now, though. Might do her more harm than good."

"Look over there!" I tell Hadrik, as I point my finger towards thirty or so drones that have come out of nowhere and are now attacking the ground troops. "We have some reinforcements! And the king is busy with a new batch of drones in the sky, so he can't come and save his men. Now's our chance to--"

He then shoves one of the king of the underground's men to the ground with his shield and starts fighting the others, as my friends prepare to follow his lead.

Just as Daren is giving us his call to action, I see a vision in which Kate's whole body begins to tremble violently while she is arching her back, and then she falls on the ground, unconscious.

Did she get an electric shock from behind in the premonition? But there was nobody close to her at the time. This can only mean one thing...

"Kate!" I shout loudly. "Albert is invisible behind you! He's trying to shock you with an electric--"

Kate doesn't wait for me to finish, and she freezes the air around her after hearing only the first few words. Out of thin air, an Albert shaped ice sculpture appears, looking as if he were in the middle of retreating after hearing me shout.

"Flower, can you unfreeze him like we practiced yesterday?" Kate says, in a hurried tone.

"Uh, yes... I think so!" Flower says, as she gets a little closer and then summons about a hundred small flying balls of fire that begin to spin around the frozen Albert faster and faster.

 The more speed the fireballs gain, the less it becomes possible to distinguish their movements and eventually it all becomes one big blur of rapidly spinning fire, while the ice covering Albert slowly melts into water.

As soon as the circling flames slow down and disappear, the now unfrozen Albert collapses on the floor with his eyes closed.

"Did it work?" Kate asks, somewhat anxiously. "Is he still alive?"

"Yes!" Flower says, after checking his pulse. "He's only unconscious, that's all!"

"So we do have a working counter-measure for my freezing, then," Kate says, relieved. "That's good to know."

"Look!" I tell Flower and Kate, as I point my finger towards thirty or so drones that have come out of nowhere and are now attacking the ground troops. "We have some reinforcements!

Please stand by!"

"Experimental emergency protocol?..." Hadrik says. "What in the blazes is that supposed to--"

A deafening silence fills the area around me as the sound of Hadrik's voice, as well as the wind from the storm and all the shouting from the rebels fighting the drones fade away completely. As I look around myself to understand what happened, I see that the whole world surrounding me has simply... disappeared.

 I am currently floating in what appears to be a sea of pure light, with none of my friends being anywhere near me. In fact, upon closer inspection of my surroundings, I realize that it is not only my friends and the world who are gone, but also my own person. When I look down I see no body: no arms, no legs, no torso... what about my head? The brightness of this place is almost blinding me, so logically speaking I must still have my eyes, right? But does that mean I'm just a floating head drifting about in this vast plane filled with nothing but light?

And what about my breathing?... I can't hear myself inhaling or exhaling. Have I just been holding my breath this entire time? Should I start breathing so I don't die of asphyxiation? My mind feels like a jumbled mess right now. I have no idea what to do.

 I try to breathe in some air, but it feels as if my airways are completely blocked. When I realize that I can't breathe at all, I begin to panic, and I automatically try to inhale harder and faster. The more I attempt to breathe, the more painful it feels. It's as if my nonexistent body was suddenly reminded that breathing was a necessary element of its survival, but it no longer remembers what it needs to make it work.

As I keep struggling to inhale and exhale, I can feel my mind gradually blanking out until my consciousness eventually fades away completely.

 I just need to calm down and think things through. I don't have a body right now, so there are no lungs for the air to go into. If I'm still alive, then it means that I don't need to breathe. In fact, is there even any air in here? What is this place, exactly? Somehow, it looks very familiar...

As my mind is slowly clearing up from the haze that it's been in this whole time, I suddenly remember the sensation that I had back when the Magium was possessing the Overseer and flinging my consciousness through all the separate planes of existence, including the ethereal plane.

Now I get it... This is the ethereal plane. That's why it seemed so familiar! It's because I've been here before. How in the world did I end up in this place, anyway? And where is everybody else? Did the Overseer's drones somehow throw them out in this wasteland too? Did they do it by using the blue crystals? I need to get away from here and find my friends. If only I could move somehow. If only I at least had some... hands!

Right as I am thinking that last word, two hands materialize in front of me, out of nowhere. I try to move the two hands and I realize that I have complete control over them, as if they were my own, even if the rest of my body is still missing.

What just happened? Is that how things work around here? Is it enough for me to make a wish and it comes true? If that's how it goes, then I want legs too. Give me legs!

 I wait around for a little while, but nothing's happening. Did I make the wish wrong? Let me try again. I wish to have legs! And the rest of my body too, actually. Give me my body back!

Again, nothing. This isn't working. Maybe I should just give up for now and try to make do with what I have. I only have my hands, not my entire arms, but I should still be able to get some use out of them, right?

As I instinctively do a swimming motion with my hands, I can feel myself advancing through the light, although there aren't really any points of reference around here, so there's no easy way for me to confirm my travelling speed. I keep swimming through the bright empty space for a few more minutes, until I hear a girl's voice calling out to me from a distance.

"Barry, is that you?" I hear Flower's voice faintly, as she is approaching me. "Wait there, don't move! I'm coming for you!"

When Flower gets closer to me, I see that her eyes are bright red, just like that time when she fought Eiden before we got into Thilias, and the aura around her body feels as if it were radiating heat.

 "Wow, Barry, you managed to conjure some hands for yourself," Flower says, once she reaches me. "That's so cool!"

"Forget my hands!" I say. "What happened to your eyes? And your whole aura feels like it's burning up. Are you okay?"

"Oh you don't need to worry about that!" Flower says. "That's just how I am, now."

She then snaps her fingers, and her whole body suddenly becomes covered in flames, even though upon closer inspection, the fire seems to be floating about one inch above her skin rather than burning her outright.

"See?" Flower says, and then she casually turns off the flames, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

"Uhm... okay," I tell her. "If you say so. Wait, how come you have your whole body and I don't? What am I doing wrong?"

"I don't know," Flower says. "I've been living here since I was born, so there was never a time when I didn't have a body in the ethereal plane. If you want to conjure a body for yourself, maybe you just need to... think harder or something? It's easy to create stuff out of nothing in this place. Look!"

 She then points her hand at an empty area in front of her, and she makes a palm tree appear out of nowhere. The palm tree then turns into a cart, and the cart soon turns into a large rock. As soon as she's done with her demonstration, Flower claps her hands once, and the rock disappears into thin air.

"What the-- that's amazing!" I say. "Can you teach me how to do that?"

"Umm... I'm not sure," Flower says. "Petal always told me that I'm not exactly the best at teaching things to others. And I'm not exactly sure how to make this any clearer to you than I already have. For me this is just something natural, you know? Maybe it's just an advantage of being an ethereal. Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here for too long. It's not good for you! Follow me, I'll take you to my house. Leila and Hadrik are already waiting there for you. And Petal too! Here, grab my hand!"

She then takes my hand without waiting for my answer, and her body gets covered in flames again, which surprisingly don't feel like they're burning me even though they should. I then feel myself vibrating loudly, as a white light of a different color than the one I've been swimming through covers us both and we get teleported to an entirely different place.

"Barry, you're alive!" I hear Leila's inner voice, which I already know from the last time she and I were sent to the ethereal plane together. "Thank goodness!"

 I look around myself and I see that we are now inside a room full of toys and countless decorations like mural paintings of knights and dragons, as well as a table on which there is an expensive looking vase with a few tulips in it. Leila and Hadrik are both standing in front of me, but I'm not seeing Illuna yet. Maybe she is in another room?

"See, Leila?" Flower says. "I told you that there would be nothing to worry about! Barry is fine, and he didn't do anything stupid, like trying to breathe without his lungs!"

"...What's that about me trying to breathe?" I say, somewhat anxiously.

"Oh," Flower says, "when I brought Leila here, I told her that most people who get thrown out of their own minds and into the light outside should be in a state of daze, mostly just floating around indefinitely until someone finds them, and that the only way they could die would be if they tried to breathe, because then they'd suddenly find themselves with a need to breathe fresh air into their lungs, but without having any actual lungs... or air. When she heard about this, Leila immediately panicked, and she told me that you're exactly the type of person who overthinks things in these sorts of situations to the point that you may well end up dying of suffocation. But you never tried to do any of that, did you, Barry?"

"Well, actually..." I say. "I may have been only a few moments away from trying to breathe at one point. The only thing that saved me was the fact that I realized there was no way I could need air to survive in this place if I'd already survived without breathing for so long."

 "I knew it!" I hear Leila's thoughts, as her mouth remains closed. "Even when we were almost being erased from existence he was doing the same thing! He almost didn't grab my hand because he was worried that I might have been an illusion, trying to trick him."

Hadrik laughs.

"Well, that's Barry for you," he says. "He always finds a way to turn even the most trivial of situations into a life-threatening adventure! But I have to say, it's still hard to accustom myself to hearing Leila's voice instead of seeing her write text in front of me. Barry, you already heard her voice before, right?"

"Yeah, I heard it the last time when we went to the ethereal plane and-- hold on a minute, why am I the only one here with a pair of floating hands? How did you guys get your bodies back so fast?"

"I'm the one who taught them how to do it," I hear an unfamiliar female voice coming from my left side.

When I turn around, I see a woman that looks as if she were in her late twenties, with blue eyes, blue hair and pointy ears, wearing a blue dress, and who is of about my height. Even though her appearance is a lot different from what I'm used to, the serious look in her eyes and her constant frown is almost unmistakable.

She then conjures a feather in front of her, she grabs it in her hand and she gives it to me.

"Hold this," she tells me. "I want you to focus on the feather while you speak the incantation that I am about to say to you. As long as you don't lose focus of the feather and you say all the words correctly, you should gain back your body. Are you ready?"

"Um, yes!" I say, as I look at the feather. "Tell me the incantation!"

 "Wow, I was right. Your blue eyes really do make you look fat!"

"Strange..." Illuna says. "Those do not seem like the kind of words you would normally say to someone whose help you require. Do you perhaps enjoy spending your time here as an invisible apparition with floating hands?"

"Okay, okay, my mistake!" I say. "I don't want to be a ghost anymore. I want my body back! Can you help me? Please?..."

"Very well," Illuna says. "Give me a moment."

She then conjures a feather in front of her, she grabs it in her hand and she gives it to me.

"Hold this," she tells me. "I want you to focus on the feather while you speak the incantation that I am about to say to you. As long as you don't lose focus of the feather and you say all the words correctly, you should gain back your body. Are you ready?"

 "Repeat after me," Illuna says. "Sehok amon rik tus selem."

"Sehok... amon rik tus... selem!" I say, as I keep staring at the feather very intently.

As soon as I'm done saying the words, I look down and I see how my arms are slowly materializing, and then my torso, and then my legs. In less than a few seconds, my whole body appears out of nowhere, as if it's only been invisible this whole time, and I am wearing the exact same clothes that I had on the earthen plane.

"That's amazing!" I say. "What did the incantation mean? I didn't recognize the language."

"It meant nothing," Illuna says, simply.

"Pardon?" I ask her, confused.

"It was gibberish," Illuna says. "Just something that I invented on the spot to make the ritual sound more believable."

"And the thing about looking at the feather?" I say. "Was that something you made up too?"

 "Yes," Illuna says. "In this place, you can do anything with your mind, as long as your thoughts are powerful enough. For something as simple as gaining back your body, all you need is to be convinced that you can do it, and you will be successful. That is why I gave you these simple tasks to accomplish. You already knew that I had helped Leila and Hadrik recover their bodies, so you were convinced that as long as you'd follow my instructions to the letter, the same would apply to you. If I were to have instead told you something vague like how you'd need to 'erase any doubts in your head and be completely confident in your own abilities', you probably would have tried to think about it logically, and you would have begun to doubt yourself, because there would be no way for you to accurately measure your level of confidence."

"You said that it's easier to obtain my body than it is to do other stuff," I say. "What about making things appear out of nothing? I saw Flower do it outside. She just made a palm tree and a cart show up, out of nowhere."

"Flower has been living here a long time, so naturally she is more accustomed to the ways of this place," Illuna says. "Aside from her advantage of being an ethereal, I think there's also the fact that on the ethereal plane you benefit from having stronger emotions rather than from analyzing every little detail, and Flower typically has strong emotions about anything. This is the only place in the world where her illogical way of thinking actually gives her the upper hand, instead of being one of her weak points."

 "Oh, I think I get it now," I say. "When I first got my hands back, I remember feeling a strong need to be able to move around, out there... in the place full of light, and that must be why I was able to have them materialized. Because of the strong emotion I was feeling at the time!"

"For future reference," Illuna says, "the 'place full of light' outside this house is called 'the ether'. That is where all souls eventually end up once the bodies from the earthen plane that they were linked with die, and also where they begin to slowly decompose into ethereal matter."

"Really?" Flower asks, shocked. "The light out there is just a bunch of dead souls?!"

"Why are you acting so surprised?" Illuna says. "You've been living here for more time than me, haven't you?"

"Yeah," Flower says, "but I just thought the reason why there was so much light was because we were really close to the sun or something..."

"There is no sun here," Illuna says. "This is the ethereal plane."

"Oh, right. Right... I knew that!" Flower says, in a nervous tone.

"So, do you guys have any idea what happened to us and where everyone else is?" I say. "Are Daren, Kate and Melindra still out there in the ether? What about the king of the underground and his men?"

 "I'm not sure what the Overseer did, exactly," Illuna says, "but I assume that he must have somehow made use of his newfound knowledge about the blue crystals and the Magium to throw the souls of everyone in the area out of their own minds."

"I remember Kate telling us at one point about how she read in an old lessathi book that a person's mind is supposedly located on the ethereal plane and not on the earthen plane," I say. "When you say that the souls got thrown out of their minds, you're talking about their minds which are located here, in this plane of existence?"

"Yes," Illuna says, "I'm talking about the fortified structures that are designed to defend each soul against the corrosive effects of the ether, and which are also meant to help connect the soul to their earthen body. This house that we are in, for example, is Flower's mind."

"Is that so?..." I say, as I take a better look around the room that I am in.

"In any case, I believe that we are straying too far from our original topic," Illuna says. "The point I was trying to make was that if the Overseer did indeed find a way to eject all of the people in the plaza out of their minds, then the majority of the people involved in the fight against the drones should be floating in the ether right now."

 "Hmm..." I say. "But Flower said that they should all be in a daze, right? How will we find them if we can't see their bodies and if they won't be clear-headed enough to answer our calls?"

"Ask Flower," Illuna says. "She's the one who found you, Hadrik and Leila, not me."

"Oh!" Flower says, when she sees us all looking at her. "Well, you see... When I realized what happened, I got this sudden, urgent feeling that I had to do something or everyone would die, and then, uh... and then..."

She pauses for a while to think, looking as if she were having a hard time trying to describe what happened to her.

"And then her eyes became bright red and the whole aura around her body was set aflame," Illuna says. "Next thing you know, she could easily locate your whereabouts from anywhere on the ethereal plane, and she could traverse long distances almost instantaneously. I'm still not entirely certain how that happened, but based on the little amount of information I have at my disposal, I'm going to assume that it was something akin to a next stage of evolution that is specific to ethereals, or something along those lines."

 "Yeah, I do think you're right about this being an ethereal-only thing," I say. "Kate's friend, Diane is also an ethereal, according to Kate and I remember clearly that her eyes were glowing when she attacked us in the sacred forest. Oh, and I don't know if you remember this, but Flower's eyes were also glowing with a bright red color that one time when she fought Eiden before we went into Thilias. This.... 'stage of evolution', as you called it, might be something related to their emotional state, because both Flower and Diane were either really angry or really determined whenever their eyes started shining."

"Uhm..." Flower says, "I'd really love to stay here and chat but I'm kind of starting to get a little worried that the others might also try to breathe, like Barry almost did, so I'd better go bring them quickly to my house just to be safe. I'll be right back!"

She then gets covered in a white light, and she teleports out of the room.

"Hey, Illuna," I say after a little while, "can you by any chance see what's going on in the earthen plane?"

"Yes," Illuna says. "We're inside Flower's mind right now, so I can control her body."

"What happened to our earthen bodies?" I say. "Are they unconscious, or?..."

 "Yes, your bodies are unconscious, but they are unhurt," Illuna says. "Nobody is moving at this time. Not even the drones. The only one awake in the area where the fight was taking place aside from myself is Arraka, who is ranting about how we can't even defend ourselves against a measly attack on our souls from the ethereal plane."

"If the drones are not moving, then could it be possible that the Overseer also displaced his own soul by mistake?" I ask. "Otherwise, I don't see any reason why he wouldn't at least try to capture the rebels while they're collapsed on the ground."

"We'll have to ask Flower if she can sense him somewhere in the ether once she comes back," Illuna says. "If he is out there, then your theory will become very likely."

"Does Flower also know where our minds are?" I hear Leila's inner voice talking, while her mouth is closed. "I have no recollection of getting thrown out of my mind, so I can't help her with directions even if she can teleport me there."

"Unfortunately no, she does not seem to be able to detect where your minds are," Illuna says. "That's why she had to bring you all here, to her own mind, as a temporary measure."

"Her mind?..." Hadrik asks, all of a sudden. "What do you mean her mind? Isn't this her house?"

 "No, this is not a real house," Illuna says, looking slightly irritated. "We've already talked about this. She made it look like a house, but in reality, this is the inside of her mind. She has complete control over this place and she can turn it into anything she wants."

"But how does--" Hadrik starts to say, but then he interrupts himself. "Ugh... Never mind. Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, here. Ever since I came to Flower's house, I've been trying really hard to not think of anything so that you guys wouldn't hear my thoughts, but the problem is that when I'm so focused on not thinking out loud by accident, I can barely follow anything of what you're saying! How are you guys making conversation so casually without jumbling your spoken words with your inner thoughts? I don't get it!"

"Well, uh..." I say, as Leila and I exchange a look. "Illuna's been here for a long time, so it must come naturally to her by now. As for me and Leila, I think it's because we've already been to the ethereal plane once before, and we kind of got the general idea of how this 'thinking out loud' stuff works."

"No, I don't think so," I say. "You probably just need more practice, that's all."

"I was afraid you might say something like that," Hadrik tells me. "I guess I'll just have to put more effort into it, then. Well, don't mind me! You can continue your conversation from before I interrupted you while I figure everything out. What were you talking about again?"

"I... kind of forgot," I say. "Let's just wait for Flower to come back and we'll decide together what needs to be done next."

I tell Hadrik. "Try using those types of thoughts instead of your regular thoughts if you want to avoid thinking out loud by mistake. It takes a little bit of practice, but once you get used to this method, it will come naturally."

"Oooh!" Hadrik says. "I think I get what you mean, now! I make quick decisions like that all the time while I'm fighting. So what you're telling me is that I need to rely more on my warrior instincts than on my logic when we're having discussions in the ethereal plane!"

"...Something like that, yes," I say.

"Now you're speaking my language!" Hadrik says, and then he laughs. "Alright, sorry to keep you waiting. Hadrik is ready to join the conversation once more! What were we talking about, again?"

 Just as Hadrik is done talking, Flower pops up into the room, with what I assume to be the rest of our friends, although I can't see their bodies.

"Sorry I was gone for so long!" Flower says. "It was REALLY difficult to locate Daren for some reason. Take a seat somewhere, guys! There's no need for you all to be standing up."

"Ugh... my head... I feel so dizzy!" I hear Daren's voice, as the rest of us are seating ourselves into the chairs and bed available in the room. "Is nobody else feeling nauseous on this plane of existence? Just me?"

"Nope," I hear Melindra's voice coming from somewhere near Daren. "No feeling of nausea whatsoever, and no dizziness either."

"I'm feeling fine as well," Kate's voice can now be heard from somewhere in the vicinity of Daren and Melindra.

"Yeah, and I'm pretty sure nobody else in this room is feeling light-headed, or they would have mentioned it by now," Hadrik says. "I think it's just you, buddy."

"Great..." Daren says. "Just my luck. If only there were some way for me to cast one of my anti-nausea spells in this place..."

"Hold on, I'll give you some medicine!" Flower says, as she opens up a drawer and takes a small wooden box out of it.

 She then opens the box and takes a pill in her hand, which she tries to hand over to Daren. As she gives it to him, the pill simply falls on the ground, while we're all just looking at Flower in complete silence.

"Oh no!" Flower says. "I forgot that you don't have a body. Wait, I'll just turn it into light essence so that I can feed it to you properly!"

"Okay?..." Daren says, in an unconvinced tone.

Flower does a few motions with her hands and the pill on the ground turns into a stream of liquid light that begins to spin in circles around the area where Daren's voice was coming from. She then stretches her arms in front of her with her palms open, and the light slowly fades away.

"Does that feel better, now?" Flower asks.

"It feels..." Daren says. "It feels... MUCH better now, thank you! My nausea is practically completely gone! How did you do it?"

"Oh, it's because the light thingy around your... um... around your spinning essence is not aligned with your uh--"

"Your soul wasn't correctly linked to your body from the earthen plane," Illuna says. "We've met a lost soul several years ago in the ether who had a similar problem, which is why Flower had that medicine ready in her drawer in case it happened again."

 "NO!" Flower shouts from the other room. "My cookies!"

"While we're waiting for Flower to clean up the mess from the kitchen," Illuna tells us, "might I suggest teaching our newest visitors how to regain their bodies? I'd rather not be speaking to disembodied ghosts for the rest of your stay here, if you don't mind."

For the next few minutes, Illuna shows Daren, Melindra and Kate how to will their bodies into existence in the same way that she taught me. Soon after she is done, Flower comes out of the kitchen with a large plate of cookies that she is now putting on a table in the middle of the room.

"There's no way you could have fixed the mess and baked new cookies in such a short amount of time," Illuna tells Flower. "You cheated, didn't you?"

"No!" Flower shouts. "I did everything by the book! I didn't make them appear out of nothing. I just... sped up the oven a little, that's all..."

}
 "I see," Daren says. "I suppose there's no point in asking you why my soul wasn't properly linked to my body on the earthen plane, is it?"

"I'm afraid there's no way for me to know that," Illuna says. "But it might be related in some way to the reason why your link to the spirit in the magical plane that is allowing you to cast magic is also defective. You're going to have to figure this out on your own."

All of a sudden, Flower squeals with happiness, as she looks around the room, seeing us all sitting down and making ourselves comfortable.

"Oh gods!" Flower says. "This is the first time in my life when I've had so many visitors in my house at the same time! I'm so excited! Wait here. I'll go bring the cookies!"

She then runs into the room where the burning smell was coming from, which has only gotten more intense as the time passed.

 "So, you cheated," Illuna says.

"Well, what was I supposed to do?" Flower asks, exasperated, as she is now getting cups of tea from a cupboard and then small plates for each of us. "I couldn't keep everyone waiting for so long. That would be rude!"

"But it's not rude when you're making me wait, is that it?" Illuna says.

"It's not the same thing!" Flower says, while she is putting the cups on the table. "You and I are living together. They are our guests. It's normal that they get special treatment. And besides, we've been using the same oven almost every day for the past twenty years! You're already used to it!"

 "You two have been eating cookies and drinking tea in this room every day for two decades?" Hadrik asks, perplexed.

"Yes," Illuna says. "Flower read somewhere in a children's book that this is how families that live in the same house are supposed to act, and since she's never had a real family before she met me, she's made me go along with this ritual of hers on a daily basis."

"But... it's not like she's literally forcing you to join her every day, is she?" Hadrik says, as Flower is done setting the table and is now heading towards the kitchen to check on the tea. "I mean, you could still refuse if you wanted to, right?"

"Of course I could," Illuna says. "What is your point?"

"Uh, nothing," Hadrik says, looking even more confused than before. "Never mind, I guess..."

So, Illuna hates the tea and biscuits tradition but still willingly participates every day for Flower's sake, huh? I guess she cares more for Flower than she lets on.

 "We can all hear what you're thinking," Illuna says, as she is staring at me with a frown. "You know this, don't you?"

"Oh, right," I say, a little embarrassed. "It was actually not my intention to say it out loud. Sorry about that!"

"The tea is ready!" we hear Flower, who was in the kitchen this whole time and didn't hear our previous conversation. "I'll bring it right away!"

She comes back a few seconds later with a kettle in her hand, and she starts pouring tea into our cups, one by one.

"Hey, this isn't bad!" Daren says, as he takes a sip of tea from his cup. "What kind of leaves did you use to make this tea?"

 "I'm not sure..." Flower says. "I just imagined the taste that I wanted the tea to have and then I conjured the leaves. I don't think they actually exist in the real world."

"The cookies are based on a recipe that you were using on the earthen plane, correct?" Melindra says, after she takes one bite. "I remember you creating some very similar cookies using the food creation spell of the golden fox."

"They are similar, but not exactly the same," Flower says. "The food creation spell is amazing, but it's still very limiting compared to what I can do here in my mind. In here, I can replicate any taste from the real world, and I can also create tastes that don't exist, using only my imagination! I have so much more freedom in this place. It's great!"

 "What's the best original food that you invented here on the ethereal plane?" I ask Flower.

"Hmm..." Flower says. "If I had to choose only one... I'd say it would probably have to be the chocolate cake."

"Definitely the chocolate cake," Illuna says.

"Only chocolate?" I say. "I would have expected it to be something more outlandish than that. Didn't you say you can create tastes that don't exist on the earthen plane?"

"Oh, it's nothing like any chocolate that you've ever tasted before," Flower says. "Petal tried to get my birthday cake to resemble it, but there just aren't enough ingredients in the real world to reproduce the exact flavor. It will be quicker if I show you. Here, try it out for yourselves!"

All of a sudden, Flower makes a plate appear on each one of our laps, with a slice of cake and a fork on top of it. As soon as I taste the cake, I understand exactly what Flower meant. It feels like it's chocolate, but the taste is so unique and distinct from anything I've tried before that I couldn't even imagine what kind of ingredients it would take to create something comparable to this. 

"Hey, you weren't kidding!" Melindra says. "You really won't find anything that tastes this good on the earthen plane. You're saying that you can just make this cake whenever you want, as many times as you want?"

 "Yep!" Flower says. "You can ask for more, if you like it. I don't have to worry about expending magical energy here, so i can go all out!"

"Sure!" Melindra says. "But before we continue with the feast, could you give us a quick summary of what's happening on the earthen plane, currently?"

"On the earthen plane?" Flower asks, and then she begins to stare in front of her while moving her hands as if she were controlling invisible strings attached to her body in the real world. "Let's see... The flying metal balls are still not moving, but some of the rebels are starting to wake up. Actually no, it's just one of the rebels. Peter is the only one awake in the real world. Oh, and I can sense him in this world too! He's swimming through the light outside, trying to retrieve his friends. Guys, I think Peter might also be an ethereal!"

"What about the Overseer?" Daren asks, as he eats some cake. "He told us that he had a 'manufactured soul' or something, didn't he? Maybe you can detect his soul out there in the light too."

 "Quick question," I say. "If you can create any food you want at no cost, why is it that you are eating the same cookies and drinking the same tea every day?"

"It's not the SAME cookies and tea!" Flower says. "I change their taste every once in a while. And it's not like I don't make other food too! It's just... a tradition, that's all. Is it really so wrong to have a tradition where we eat cookies and drink tea every day?"

"I... guess not," I say. "I still find it a little weird for a tradition, though."

"Well, I like it so I don't care if it's weird or not!" Flower says. "And Petal likes it too. Right, Petal?"

"Oh, yes," Illuna says, in an ironic tone. "It's the moment that I look forward to the most every day."

"See?" Flower says, completely oblivious to the sarcastic undertones of Illuna's previous statement. "We both like it, so there's no reason to change it!"

"When you put it like that, I suppose it makes perfect sense," I say.

"Exactly!" Flower says. "Now less talking and more drinking, unless you want the tea to get cold!"

 "Does this mean that you can create the biscuits from my hometown without the recipe?" I say.

"I think so!" Flower says. "Let me see if I still remember the taste. Was it something like... this?"

As she is saying the last word, she extends her hand towards me and a biscuit materializes in her palm. I immediately grab the biscuit and take a bite from it to have a taste.

"Wow, the taste is almost identical!" I say. "This is fantastic! Can you make more?"

"Of course!" Flower says, as she creates a bowl full of biscuits on the table, next to the large plate of cookies. "Barry's biscuits for everyone!"

"Finally, we can have some more of these!" Daren says, as he picks up one of the biscuits. "Nicely done, Flower!"

"Thank you!" Flower says, happily. "Eat as many as you want. There's no magical energy that depletes when I create them or anything, so I can go all out!"

"I have one question, before we continue with the feast," Melindra says. "Flower, could you give us a quick summary of what's happening on the earthen plane, currently?"

 "On the earthen plane?" Flower asks, and then she begins to stare in front of her while moving her hands as if she were controlling invisible strings attached to her body in the real world. "Let's see... The flying metal balls are still not moving, but some of the rebels are starting to wake up. Actually no, it's just one of the rebels. Peter is the only one awake in the real world. Oh, and I can sense him in this world too! He's swimming through the light outside, trying to retrieve his friends. Guys, I think Peter might also be an ethereal!"

"What about the Overseer?" Daren asks, as he is finishing the biscuit from before. "He told us that he had a 'manufactured soul' or something, didn't he? Maybe you can detect his soul out there in the light too."

"Yeah, I... think I can sense him!" Flower says. "He's moving around the ether, so it doesn't look like he's unconscious. He might just be trying to find his own mind so he can get back to it."

#if(v_b3_ch9_premonition == 2) {
 "Is Kate still out there too?" I ask Flower. "I was expecting you to bring her back when you teleported here with Daren and Melindra, but I haven't heard a word from her so I'm assuming she's not in the room with us."

"No, Kate was never out in the ether," Flower says. "I can guarantee it. I don't think she was kicked out of her mind like the rest of you."

"The technique that the Overseer used to remove everyone's souls from their minds likely required an active connection between the soul and the body in order to work," Illuna says. "Kate was already unconscious at that time, so the technique was probably ineffective against her."

"I'm glad she's okay," Flower says, "but I was kinda hoping that I'd get to meet her in the ethereal plane. I would have really liked to show her my house."

"Hey, does anyone know what happened to the king of the underground?" Hadrik says. "He was really high up in the sky when the Overseer knocked us out with that technique of his. Could he have died from the fall by any chance?"

"I saw the moment when the king of the underground fell from the sky," Illuna says. "The impact of the fall was cushioned by some sort of shield that he had around himself, made out of hardened aura. From the looks of it, he didn't sustain any serious injuries."

"Of course he would have a trick like that up his sleeve..." Daren says.

"We've had the opportunity to shelter a few lost souls that wandered close to Flower's house over the years," Illuna says, "but each of them needed a different amount of time to remember where their own mind was. Usually it doesn't take more than two hours."

"In two hours we could all be dead if our real bodies are going to just lie on the ground this whole time!" Daren says. "Illuna, isn't there some way you could use your water techniques to destroy the drones while they're not moving?"

"What if we tried to--" we hear Leila's inner voice, but Daren interrupts her.

"Whoa, who said that?" Daren says, as he is looking around the room.

"It was me," Leila says again, with her mouth closed. "I said that."

"But you're not opening your mouth when you're talking!" Daren says. "Is that-- does this mean I'm hearing your thoughts, like we did with Barry earlier?"

"Exactly," Leila says.

 "Ah crap," we suddenly hear Daren say in a really loud voice, although his lips are not moving. "I just realized something. If I can hear Barry and Leila's thoughts, does this mean everyone in the room can hear mine too? Can they hear me even now, as I'm thinking all this?"

"Yes, Daren we can all hear you," Illuna says. "Also, you might want to turn the volume down a notch. You sound like you're shouting when you're thinking out loud."

"Oh, sorry about that!" Daren says.

He then starts thinking to himself again, in the same shouting voice as before.

"Great," Daren thinks. "Now I'll have to pay attention to my thoughts all the time so that I don't accidentally talk over people. This is going to be such a pain."

When he sees us trying hard to contain our laughter while looking at him, Daren addresses us again, this time with his normal talking voice.

"I was thinking out loud again, wasn't I?" Daren says.

"Uh-huh," I tell him. "And you were shouting again too, in case you were wondering."

"Leila, is this how you sound inside your head whenever you're thinking to yourself?" Kate asks. 

"Yeah..." Leila says, looking a little embarrassed. "It's just a voice that I made up by listening to other girls around me and playing with different tonalities until I found one that I liked. It's not my 'real' voice or anything."

"There's no reason to be embarassed," Kate says. "I think your voice really fits you!"

"Thank you," Leila says, with a slight smile.

"I'm sorry," I say to Illuna,"but did you just imply that the only thing you need to cast magic in this place is to be familiarized with the magical theory that lies at the foundation of the spells?..."

"You're making it sound a lot easier than it actually is," Illuna says. "For someone like Flower or me, these things come naturally, because she's an ethereal and I am a magical spirit. For someone like you, who is neither used to the ethereal plane nor to casting magic in general, it would be necessary to be familiar with the movement of every individual magical particle making up the flow of a spell, and to control both their direction and intensity flawlessly. That is of course, on top of already knowing the theory behind the spell."

"So, if I know all that stuff, I should be able to cast the spell?" I say.

A ball of fire suddenly forms at the point where I'm focusing my energy, and then the ball flies away from me, hitting one of the walls from Flower's room and exploding into flames.

I've memorized these flows a thousand times. This isn't anything new for me. The only difference between now and then is that now I know for certain that it can be done. This time I won't fail.

As I'm imagining the positions of the magical particles in my head, I can sense the flow of magic accumulating in front of my palms, just like the books said it would. The volatility of the magical flow takes me by surprise for a moment, but then I immediately remember the advice of an old hermit that I used to visit on a regular basis, back when I still thought that it would be possible for a non-mage to cast magic.

"When the flow seems like it's getting away from you, you shouldn't try to correct it," the old hermit used to say. "That will only make you lose control faster. What you should do instead is follow it. I've told this to many young mages before, but they wouldn't listen. As long as your form is correct and your theory is sound, there is no reason for your spell to fail. Just follow the flow of magic until it comes back to its optimal position, and then continue casting the spell.

I used to be so obsessed with these things that I would try out spells in the middle of the day in my backyard, while people stared at me like I was some kind of lunatic. Believe me...

I think I'm finally beginning to understand why she has become so determined lately in trying to unlock your magical stats."

She pauses.

"How many other spells do you know by heart?" Illuna asks me. "I am assuming that you only tested a limited number of spells before you concluded that it was impossible for you to cast magic on the earthen plane?"

"Yeah, I learned a few spells from each traditional and non-traditional element, but not much more than that," I say. "Oh, and I should probably also be able to cast the air currents that allow me to fly, because I had to create them myself during that fight with the stillwater skeletons, so I am familiar enough with them.

She then rushes to our side of the room and stops in front of me.

I spend the next few minutes showing Flower the fire spells that I already know how to cast, while she gives me some tips on how to improve my stance and my movements so that I can make the spells more effective. When we're done with the ones that I know, Flower tries to teach me some of her own spells, but unfortunately her explanations are... not exactly as helpful as I would have hoped.

"Okay, I'll be right there!" Flower says, as she's done placing all the flowers back in the vase.

She then rushes to our side of the room and stops in front of me.

"So, what do you want to learn, Barry?" Flower says.

I spend the next few minutes showing Flower the fire spells that I already know how to cast, while she gives me some tips on how to improve my stance and my movements so that I can make the spells more effective. When we're done with the ones that I know, Flower tries to teach me some of her own spells, but unfortunately her explanations are... not exactly as helpful as I would have hoped.

"So, the easiest way to learn the flow of this spell is to first do a backflip, and then to land on one hand," Flower says. "Here, let me show you!"

"Very well," Illuna says. "Flower, can you come here for a moment? Barry needs your-- Flower, what are you doing?"

"I'm trying to fix the vase!" Flower says, as she is using glue to put all the pieces back together, one by one.

"We don't have time for this," Illuna says. "You're the one who said that guests need to be given special treatment, and it just so happens that one of our guests needs you to teach him magic. Either revert the vase to its original form or glue it back together later, but hurry up."

"Okay, fine..." Flower says, as she returns the vase to its previous state with a single flick of her finger, and then she puts it back on the table.

She then rushes to our side of the room and stops in front of me.

 "No, no," I say. "There's no need to show me. I believe you! I was only hoping that you could maybe teach me something that requires... a little less movement?"

"Oh, right, right, of course!" Flower says. "I'm sorry, it's just that I'm trying to figure out how to explain this to you in a way that doesn't sound too much like an elementalist."

"What do you mean?" I ask.

"Well, for example when I was teaching Kate yesterday how to better control her freezing beam," Flower says, "I could just tell her to put less intensity into the middle of the beam and to spread the energy more to the sides, and she would instinctively know how to do that. It's hard to think of a way to explain it to you when you've never actually experienced it yourself, and only read about it from books..."

"Oh, I get what you're saying now," I say. "I did sort of experience what it's like to be an elementalist when I had my magical stats temporarily unlocked during my fights with Tyrath and the stillwater skeletons, but now that the instinctive magical knowledge I was getting from the device is gone, I can't really make heads or tails of it. If I remember correctly, it was less about visualizing the flow of magic in my head and more about being in tune with some sort of energy from inside me that I could mold into whatever shape I wanted, with an infinite number of possibilities."

 "Yeah, something like that!" Flower says. "The main advantage of being an elementalist is that you can just create spells from your element on a whim, without following any rules! The problem is that I can't really teach you any of those spells, because most of them are improvised, and I wouldn't even know how to begin explaining them to you."

"But there was this one spell that you thought you invented and it turned out that somebody else actually invented it before you, remember?" I say. "We talked about it when we were disarming traps in the tunnels beneath Ollendor. Maybe you also have some other spells like that in your repertoire and you just don't know it yet. Let me give you a quick summary of all the fire spells I know from books, and you'll tell me if any of these sound familiar to you, alright?"

"Okay!" Flower says. "Let's give it a shot!"

For about forty minutes or so, I exchange information with Flower about the fire spells I know, and whenever we find one that she recognizes, I ask her to give me as many details as she can, until I can figure out what types of flows and patterns best fit her description. Fortunately, since I already know so many spells, it is easier for me to observe repetitive patterns between them, so I can mostly guess the directions and movements of the magical particles even if the information is incomplete.

 "It is refreshing to see that your expectations are realistic, for once, but this is not the answer I was looking for, I'm afraid," Illuna says.

"Why not?" I say.

"You of all people should know that a spell categorized as easy in a manual is not necessarily also easy to learn in practice," Illuna says. "Even if the spell has very few steps to learn, you may still find yourself getting those steps wrong half of the time until you've successfully mastered it. Do you understand what I mean now?"

"Yeah, I think I get what you're trying to say," I answer her. "It's much better to have a few spells that I can count on at all times than to have many spells that are unreliable, especially during a mage battle where a simple mistake could cost me my life. Do you happen to have a list of spells that would fit this description?"

"I believe I do," Illuna says. "If we start training immediately, you might actually have the chance to become proficient in a good number of them, depending on your performance. Let's get to it."

For about forty minutes or so, Illuna helps me learn the majority of the spells on her list. I can clearly see that she has studied the theory behind these spells from the way she's teaching them to me, and thanks to her clear and concise explanations, I manage to learn a lot more than I would have hoped in such a brief period of time. I guess I made a good call when I chose her as the teacher.

 "If I only have time for one, air would be my choice," I say.

"Seriously?" Melindra says. "You want to learn wind magic from me even though you already know that I don't have complete control over my own magic?"

"Hey, as far as I'm aware, you only have trouble with controlling the level of your power, not the spells themselves," I say. "I'm sure you'll do fine as a teacher!"

Melindra shrugs.

"If you think you already know enough magical theory to fill in the gaps, then be my guest," she says. "Just don't come complaining to me afterwards if this ends up being a huge waste of time."

I spend the next few minutes showing Melindra the wind spells that I already know how to cast, while she gives me some tips on how to improve my stance and my movements so that I can make the spells more effective. When we're done with the ones that I know, however, things start becoming a little more difficult.

 "Hmm..." Melindra says, after she sees me fail a spell that she just explained to me. "Give me a second. I'm trying to figure out how to explain this in a way that makes sense for someone who is used to learning magic from books and not through trial and error."

"I mean, I'm fine with trial and error too, as long as it doesn't take too long," I say. "How do you usually learn new spells?"

"Well," Melindra says, "I'm not sure how magic works on this plane of existence, since I can't seem to get it to work myself, but what I normally do is that I try to, uh... resonate with the correct frequency of the magical energy that builds up inside me while casting the spell. Does that make sense to you?"

"I think it does, yeah..." I say. "That's how you cast spells as an elementalist, right? I remember doing something similar when I had my magic stats unlocked during my fights with Tyrath and the stillwater skeletons. The problem is that I don't really feel any energy inside me while I'm casting spells in this realm, so I can't make use of this information. Isn't there anything you could tell me about the direction of the flow? For example... what direction do you instinctively look at when you start casting the spell? What about afterwards? I'm pretty sure that the way you move your eyes as an elementalist should be the most indicative of the direction that the flow of magic is supposed to take."

 "Let me try it now," Melindra says, as she gets into a stance, closes her eyes and then tries to visualize the non-existent magical energy from this plane of existence. "It starts with the upper left, then it goes all the way down, then it slowly goes back up heading towards the right until--"

"Perfect!" I say. "That's all I needed to know."

"Really?" Melindra asks. "That's it?"

"Yeah," I say. "I've studied many thousands of spells, so I can usually detect a pattern pretty quickly if I've seen it a few times before. As luck would have it, this is one of the more common patterns when it comes to magic flows, so I'm pretty confident that I know where it goes from here. I'll give it a try, and you can correct my movements if I'm too far off-course. Here we go!"

After I manage to cast the spell that Melindra was trying to teach me, we use the same learning method for the next few spells, and it works flawlessly. As I am focusing on learning as many spells as possible in the limited time we have at our disposal, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing.

"I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be teaching you ice magic," Kate says, after she stops in front of me.

"Time sure flies, doesn't it?" I say. "Who knows? If you don't keep up, I might be the one teaching you ice magic in the not-so-distant future!"

"Is that so?" Kate says, with her arms crossed, while raising an eyebrow. "Let's see if you can cast magic as well as you can brag, then. Get in your stance. I want you to show me how cold you can make the air around us in the next thirty seconds."

 I spend the next few minutes showing Kate the ice spells that I already know how to cast, while she gives me some tips on how to improve my stance and my movements so that I can make the spells more effective. When we're done with the ones that I know, she begins teaching me some new spells, which I immediately recognize as being from one of the intermediate magic manuals that I've read in the past. Her explanations are all clear and to the point, which makes the process of learning a lot faster than I was expecting. I guess I made a good call when I chose her as the teacher.

"So, how does it feel?" Kate says, as she watches me practicing the movements required to shoot an ice beam.

"How does what feel?" I ask her.

"Having achieved your lifelong dream in a different plane of existence," Kate says.

I pause from my magic practice for a brief time, to ponder over Kate's words.

 "It feels... good," I tell her, after a while. "This may not be the first time when I've had the opportunity to cast magic, but it's the first time when I feel like I've actually earned it. At long last, I can say that my long years of relentless study have not been wasted. Even if I'm essentially just using my imagination in a realm governed by our minds, I can't help but feel that this may be one of the most important steps I've taken towards my goal of becoming a mage. For now, let's just say that I'm planning to enjoy these moments for as long as I can!"

"I'm glad," Kate says, with a slight smile. "Now get back to work. Your movements are lacking and your stance is deplorable. You need to work a lot more on your form before you can conjure anything close to the ice beams that you've seen from me."

"Yes, ma'am!" I say, and then I begin my practice again.

Once I manage to shoot a beam of ice of acceptable proportions, Kate continues to teach me a few more of her spells, and as I am focusing on the task at hand, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing.

 "Oh, right," Leila says. "I suppose that makes sense."

"So... are you ready, Barry?" Flower says, as I am now casting my air currents on myself, so that I'll be able to fly through the ether at a moment's notice.  "Where do you think we should teleport first? We could go and fight the Overseer directly, or we could try to meet up with Peter first and team up with him.

"Can't we wait just another minute?" Daren says. "I feel like I've almost got this ethereal spell casting thing figured out. For real this time! And once I do, I'll be able to come with you and help with the healing, at least!"

"You've been saying that you need 'just another minute' for the past fifteen minutes," Illuna tells him. "Somehow I doubt that this time is going to be any different. Either way, on the off-chance that you do manage to figure it out, Flower and I are telepathically linked due to our soul fusion, so I can contact her no matter where she is on the ethereal plane and she will come back to teleport you to the battlefield."

"You two are telepathically linked?" Leila asks, surprised. "Does this mean that you are hearing each other's thoughts all the time?"

"I'm not hearing her thoughts any more than I'm hearing yours while we are in the same room," Illuna says. "As long as we are both careful to not use words when we're thinking, we can keep our thoughts to ourselves."

 While I am still busy practicing, Flower suddenly turns around and she looks intently at one of the room's walls, as if she were trying to see through them. This catches the attention of Illuna, who now asks her a question.

"What's wrong?" Illuna says. "Did something happen in the ether?"

"Yeah..." Flower answers Illuna. "It looks like Peter and the Overseer are both on the move. They haven't run into each other yet, but they probably will soon. Also, Peter seems to have already found the king of the underground's soul, and they're currently travelling together."

As Illuna and Flower are talking, we can hear some grunts in the background from Daren, who is putting a lot of effort in trying to replicate my spell casting technique, although he's had no success with it so far. My other friends tried it too at first, but they eventually gave up and just decided to enjoy the food and beverage served to them by Flower. At the present time, Flower, Illuna and I are the only ones who seem to be able to cast any sort of spells in this place.

"In that case, I don't think we can afford to wait any longer," Illuna says. "If you want to join the battle on the ethereal plane, you should probably do it before it begins."
