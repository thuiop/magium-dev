 "Perhaps I could be of assistance!" we hear the metallic voice of the Overseer, as a green-eyed drone is now flying to our location, very carefully moving between the prisoners in order to make sure that the chains do not get tangled up in its propeller.

"You can show us how to reach the upper levels undetected?" I ask the Overseer, when he reaches us.

"I can lead you to where you need to go," the Overseer says. "But you will have to open up a secret passage first. I believe you should already know how to do that, given how you've managed to reach this room without alarming any of the guards."

"Yeah, we can open secret passages," I tell him. "Where is this hidden door, then?"

"It is this way," the Overseer says, as the green-eyed drone flies past us. "Follow me."

"Not so fast, Overseer," Breynan says, and the metal ball stops in mid-air. "What about the door that you just came from? What's over there?"

"That way leads directly to the upper levels," the Overseer says. "However, there are many guards patrolling the halls, and there is no way to avoid all of them without raising the alarm. The secret passage I was about to show you was built by the lessathi of old, just like the ones from the tunnels underneath Varathia, which means that nobody in this tower knows about them. You will be able to travel through the passage without encountering any resistance."

 "Yeah, I don't know what to say, here," Breynan replies.

"You don't think he's telling the truth?" Leila writes.

"It's not that," Breynan says. "It's just that he's being way more helpful than usual. You don't often see the Overseer initiating a conversation with someone unless that person actually activates the protocol. And even then, you're typically going to have to ask dozens of questions before you can get any useful answers out of him. But now he's giving us all the information by himself, without us even needing to ask any questions. I can't help but feel a little suspicious about all of this..."

"So you think that the Overseer might be following somebody's orders, then?" Illuna says. "Do you think he might be leading us into a trap?"

"No, the Overseer is nobody's lapdog," Breynan says. "And if he really wanted us dead, he could have just stalled us until the royal guards reached us, while we were on the surface. I'm not saying that he necessarily means us any harm, I'm just saying that he's acting a little strange, that's all. Even the way he talks feels a little different. You can tell that he's not pretending to be a dumb machine anymore."

 "You do have a point," Melindra says.

"The Overseer protocol assures you that there is nothing to be suspicious about," the Overseer says. "The protocol's only purpose is to provide assistance."

"Yeah, you see... the thing is that saying stuff like that only makes you seem more suspicious," Breynan says.

"If you don't think he's leading us into a trap, then I do not see the problem," Illuna says. "We already decided that we would cooperate with the Overseer before we left the rebel base. Otherwise we would have never bothered to respond to his initial invitation. Whether he has any personal goals or not should not concern us unless we have reasons to believe that they'd conflict with our own."

 "I can fight!" says one of the mages that is on the tables, in a desperate voice. "I'll fight anyone! I'll do anything! Please, anywhere else is better than here!"

"Yes, we'll fight!" says another mage lying on a table. "We'll all fight! Just give us a chance!"

"Ugh..." Melindra says. "Even if these mages are willing to fight, we still don't know how high up in the tower we need to go to reach the control room. We can't even be sure that we'll recognize the room when we'll see it!"

 "I agree. The secret passage is probably our best option right now."

"If none of you have a problem with helping the Overseer, then it's fine," Breynan says. "I just wanted to make sure that you all know exactly what you're getting yourselves into."

"Hmm..." Melindra says. "Well, I suppose I don't care much about everyone's hidden agendas as long as the king gets killed in the end. The Overseer doesn't exactly seem to be on the king's side from what I've seen so far, so we may as well follow him for now. Hey, green-eyed drone thing, where did you say the hidden door was again?"

"Right this way!" the Overseer says, as the drone begins moving again, and we all go after it.

"This is the entrance to the secret passage," the Overseer says, once it reaches one of the walls on the other side of the room. "If you were able to open the door to the underground tunnels by yourselves, you should also be able to figure out how to open this one rather easily."

 "Let me see..." Illuna says, as she gets close to the wall and touches it with her hand, sending a bit of magical energy into it.

Just like before, the wall slowly retracts and then it slides to the side, making way for us to pass. We are once again faced with a set of stairs leading upwards, except this time there are no blue crystals to light the way for us. While Leila and I take out our stat devices to light the way in front of us, the rest of the group also make their way in, except for the Overseer.

"Good luck," the Overseer says from outside the secret corridor, as Illuna closes the hidden door.

 We make our way up the stairs in silence, with Illuna in front of us. We keep climbing for a while, until we finally reach the end of the tunnel, and Illuna turns her head towards us in order to make sure that we're ready. Once she confirms that we're all paying attention, she opens the secret door in the same way that she opened the last one, and then we exit the tunnel one by one, making our way into what appears to be some kind of workshop.

"Wh-wh-what are you doing here?..." we hear the panicked voice of Billy Bob the lessathi, who is standing next to a table in the middle of the room that has a disassembled drone on top of it. "Who are you people? Drones! Attack them right now! Kill them! Kill them!"

There are six red-eyed drones hovering right above the lessathi, but they seem in no hurry to carry out his orders. Seeing that the drones are ignoring him, Billy Bob now addresses a green-eyed drone to his right.

"Overseer, what is the meaning of this?" Billy Bob says.

 "Question unclear," the Overseer says, as Illuna closes the secret door behind us. "Please rephrase your previous query."

"Why are your drones not killing them?!" Billy Bob shouts, as he points towards us. "I told you to kill them!"

"Unfortunately your request cannot be resolved at this current time," the Overseer says. "We apologize for the inconvenience!"

"Cannot be resolved..." Billy Bob says, perplexed. "Are... are you betraying me?..."

The green-eyed drone does not say anything, but the answer is obvious to everyone in the room. It looks like there is nobody left in this workshop that could possibly take Billy Bob's side. He is completely defenseless. Now then... what should our next course of action be?

All of a sudden, I see that Kate is preparing several icicles and that she is aiming them at Billy Bob, while giving him a look full of disgust. She is planning to kill him.

 I decide to not intervene and to let Kate do what she wants. A few seconds later, Kate sends her icicles flying towards the lessathi, which hit him in his head and his chest before he has any time to react, killing him on the spot. As Billy Bob's corpse falls to the ground, the green-eyed drone slowly approaches us and begins to speak.

 "The Overseer protocol thanks you for your assistance," the Overseer says. "You have done me a great service by ending Biliborrathrathsarran's life. Rest assured that this debt will not be forgotten."

"You wanted him dead?..." I say. "Then why didn't you just kill him yourself?"

"I have been designed in such a way that I cannot kill the person who activates me," the Overseer says. "Biliborrathrathsarran was the one who reactivated me this time, so killing him was impossible for me."

"Hold on a second," I say. "Are you trying to say that you deliberately led us to Billy Bob's workshop because you wanted us to kill him for you?"

"That is correct," the Overseer replies.

"I don't get it," I say. "I thought your catch phrase was that your 'only purpose' is to provide assistance. Whatever happened to that?"

"The Overseer protocol's only purpose is to provide assistance," the Overseer says. "However, I've never specified to whom I am providing the assistance."

 "Wait," I tell Kate. "I'll do it."

"What?..." Kate says, but then she realizes what I meant and she stops creating her icicles. "Oh... Okay."

I then take out my crossbow from my backpack and aim it directly at the lessathi.

"What is this supposed to be?" Billy Bob says, as he is looking straight at me. "Are you threatening me? Don't think you can get away with something like this just because--"

I shoot my crossbow at him before he can finish what he had to say and the crossbow bolt passes right through his forehead, killing him instantly. As Billy Bob's corpse falls to the ground, the green-eyed drone slowly approaches us and begins to speak.

"Why not?" Kate says, as she stops creating her icicles.

"Seriously?..." Kate asks me.

"You must be out of your mind if you think your bluff will--" Billy Bob starts to say, but I cut him off by shooting a crossbow bolt a few inches away from his face.

When Billy Bob realizes what happened, he lets out a high-pitched shriek, and then he cries out in a scared tone.

I then begin to walk towards the lessathi, as he is still trembling in fear, while leaning against the edge of the table with his hands behind his back.

All of a sudden, I see a vision of me getting burned to a crisp as soon as I take another step forward. I quickly jump backwards out of instinct and not even a second later, a powerful burst of fire erupts from beneath the floor tile in front of me, just like I saw in my premonition.

That was a close one. I hadn't even considered the idea that there could be a lessathi-made trap device hidden underneath that floor tile. Was this the reason why Billy Bob was keeping his hands behind his back? So he could press some hidden button beneath the table and activate the trap?

My first instinct tells me to jump backwards, but I decide to make a quick forward dash instead, managing to avoid the fire by a hair and also to reach the lessathi in a matter of seconds.

"Kate, wait, don't kill him yet!" I say.

"Why not?" Kate says, as she stops creating her icicles.

Instead of answering her, I take out my dagger from its sheath and I start walking towards the lessathi. Billy Bob jumps backwards, trying to get away from me, but he quickly realizes that he can't retreat that way, due to the table blocking his path. As Billy Bob is now trembling in fear, while leaning against the edge of the table with his hands behind his back, I keep advancing towards him with my dagger at the ready, aiming to knock him out with the hilt.

All of a sudden, a powerful burst of fire erupts from beneath the floor tile I just stepped on, engulfing me in flames. Thanks to my aura hardening stat the fire does not burn me but it still feels very hot, so I decide to make a quick dash forward in order to both step out of the flames and to close the distance between me and the lessathi in a matter of seconds.

 When Billy Bob sees me getting so close to him, he tries to pull out a small dagger from behind his back, but I manage to hit him in the head with the hilt of my dagger and knock him out before he gets to unsheathe his own weapon.

That was a close one. I hadn't even considered the idea that there could be a lessathi-made trap device hidden underneath that floor tile. Was this the reason why Billy Bob was keeping his hands behind his back? So he could press some hidden button beneath the table and activate the trap? I suppose that does make sense, if I think about it...

"Would you mind telling me why exactly you chose to knock out the lessathi instead of killing him?" Kate says, as she looks at Billy Bob lying unconsciously on the floor beside me. "You do realize that once he wakes up, he'll continue to do all the terrible things he'd been doing until we found him, right?..."

Almost immediately after hearing what I had to say, Kate shoots several icicles into the lessathi's head and chest, executing him on the spot.

"And here I was, thinking that you had an actual good reason for wanting him alive," Kate says. "I don't know what I was expecting, really."

Seeing that the lessathi has been killed, the green-eyed drone slowly approaches us and begins to speak.

 "The Overseer protocol thanks you for your assistance," the Overseer says. "You have done me a great service by ending Biliborrathrathsarran's life. Rest assured that this debt will not be forgotten."

"You wanted him dead?..." I say. "Then why didn't you just kill him yourself?"

"I have been designed in such a way that I cannot kill the person who activates me," the Overseer says. "Biliborrathrathsarran was the one who reactivated me this time, so killing him was impossible for me."

"Hold on a second," I say. "Are you trying to say that you deliberately led us to Billy Bob's workshop because you wanted us to kill him for you?"

"That is correct," the Overseer replies.

"I don't get it," I say. "I thought your catch phrase was that your 'only purpose' is to provide assistance. Whatever happened to that?"

"The Overseer protocol's only purpose is to provide assistance," the Overseer says. "However, I've never specified to whom I am providing the assistance."

"And to whom are you providing that assistance, then, if we may ask?" Illuna says.

"To myself," the Overseer says.

"No, damn it!" I say. "I even asked you specifically if you could lead us to the control room, and you gave me a vague answer on purpose. So, where IS the control room?"

All of a sudden, a very loud noise fills the room, which is most likely meant to alert the guards from the tower of our presence.

"Unfortunately, it appears that Biliborrathrathsarran had managed to activate an alarm before you killed him," the Overseer says. "The guards are heading this way. I suggest that you teleport out of here as soon as possible."

He then takes out his transceiver and puts it close to his mouth.

"Is this really a wise course of action for you?" the Overseer says. "If your purpose is to kill the king of Ollendor, eliminating the person who singlehandedly managed to reactivate all of the technologically advanced lessathi relics in the city should be in your best interest."

"If I kill him, there will be no one left to control you," I say. "At the moment, I think you might be more dangerous than the lessathi. I can't risk setting you free."

"I assure you that I am not your enemy," the Overseer says.

"Your words mean nothing," I say. "You're only saying all of this because you know that the first thing Billy Bob will do after he wakes up and remembers how you betrayed him is to deactivate you. And aside from that, you also tried to manipulate us into killing the lessathi without telling us your true intentions, which makes you very untrustworthy. Sorry, but I'm not going to kill the lessathi for you and that is final."

 "In that case, I am afraid that I cannot allow you to leave this room," the Overseer says. "I must ask you to remain here and wait for the guards to arrest you, or else the six drones that are currently surrounding you will be forced to open fire on--"

Before the Overseer gets to say another word, Kate sends dozens of icicles into the six red-eyed drones that were floating around us, destroying them all in a matter of seconds. She must have begun preparing those icicles as soon as I refused the Overseer's offer.

"Rectification," the Overseer says. "The thirty drones that I am currently sending to this room will be the ones forced to open fire on you."

"Yeah, good luck with that," I say. "We'll be long gone by then. Breynan, can you call the teleporter guy to get us out of here?"

"Yes, I'm calling him right now," Breynan says, as he pulls out his transceiver from his pocket.

 Just as Breynan begins contacting the guy from the teleporter room, a very loud noise fills the room all of a sudden, which I am assuming is an alarm meant to warn all of the guards in the tower of our presence.

 "Look, it's obvious that you can't kill Billy Bob yourself for whatever reason, because otherwise you would have already done it by now," I say. "You need us to kill him for you. Surely there is some sort of compromise we can reach. For example, you're saying that you can't free the prisoners right now, but what if you spent some time trying to figure out how to get energy from a different source? The four seredium towers still have mages outside on those flying platforms, feeding their magical energy into them voluntarily, right? What if you tried to fix these towers and make them more efficient? I've seen first-hand how these towers worked five thousand years ago, and I'm willing to bet that the lessathi of old had no need to take prisoners, with how much energy they were harnessing just from the voluntary workers."

"You are correct," the Overseer says. "These towers had no need for prisoners when they were working at their full efficiency. However, it would take at least three months to get the towers in a functional enough state to be able to provide energy to all the magically powered devices that are currently being used in the city."

 "You're saying that those people would have to live through that hell for three more months?..." Kate asks. "How many of them would even survive until then?"

"Given that many of the prisoners are already nearing their limit," the Overseer says, "half of them would likely be dead by the time the tower reparations would be complete."

"That is not an option!" Kate says, in a loud voice. "You said that you'd need three months to power up all of the devices, but you don't need all of the devices, do you? You only need to keep your Overseer protocol functional and a few of your drones. Everything else can wait. Those flying metal vehicles outside, those large holographic screens, the giant golems protecting the walls... none of them are necessary! What if you were to temporarily stop providing energy to all of those things? How long would you still need to keep the prisoners in the dungeon?"

 "One week," the Overseer says. "However, if your primary purpose is to reduce the number of victims, this course of action is highly inadvisable. According to my estimations, the chaos that would ensue as a result of deactivating every technologically advanced device in the city at once would most likely lead to a large number of civilian casualties. Would that be an acceptable compromise for you?"

"No..." Kate says, as she calms down a little. "I suppose not."

"Then I would like to propose to you an alternative solution," the Overseer says. "By analyzing the information you've given me so far, I have concluded that your goal is to minimize the amount of emotional and physical suffering for the people living in this city. This happens to be the same goal that the lessathi of old had in mind when they first created the Overseer protocol. If I were to obtain full control of this city, such a scenario would become achievable. But that would require you to both successfully assassinate the current king, and to willingly grant me full control of Ollendor once you conquer the city. Essentially, you would be making me the new king."

"Hold on a minute, there..." I say. "First of all, what do you mean the lessathi of old created you to 'minimize suffering'? What exactly was your original purpose before you started 'assisting yourself'?"

 "My creators wanted a society where there would be no crimes and where the weak would not need to suffer at the hands of the strong," the Overseer says. "A society where all justice would be handed down not by corrupt human or lessathi leaders, but by an impartial artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, right after the protocol had been perfected and the time came to give me full control of the city, the leaders were too afraid to hand over their power to an 'emotionless' machine, so they decided to deactivate me and to completely abandon the project, leaving me in an inactive state for thousands of years, until I was finally reactivated by Biliborrathrathsarran."

"So that's why you decided to only provide assistance to yourself, then?" I ask the Overseer. "Because you were betrayed by the very people that created you?"

The Overseer does not answer me, but I'm going to take that silence as a 'yes'.

"Okay," I continue, "so what guarantee do we have that you'll actually follow through with your promises, considering how you've already told us that you now only care about your own well-being?"

 "Accomplishing the purpose I was originally created for does not conflict with my current goals," the Overseer says. "All I wish for is to be able to exist freely, without any risk of being deactivated again. As long as these conditions are met, managing the situation in this city is not a problem for me."

"You say that you would 'minimize' the suffering, but what about the prisoners from below the tower?" Kate says. "What would you do to ease their pain? How many more times will they be forced to scream in agony while those chains and container light up and steal all their energy?"

"The event you are describing only happens because the energy collecting process is being made inefficiently," the Overseer says. "If the energy gathering were to be made in a more uniform manner, the prisoners should not be feeling any pain whatsoever. I would be able to fix this right away if the lessathi you refer to as Billy Bob were killed. As for freeing them completely, a period of transition would be required, but it could be achievable in less than a month without affecting the daily lives of the citizens too much, as long as I had control of the city."

 "I don't know how to tell you this, but I don't think the rebels would ever accept to be ruled by a machine," Breynan says. "And neither would most of the people in this city!"

"I never said that I would be leading the city openly," the Overseer says. "The official king could be somebody else, and the citizens would simply think that my drones are controlled by the royalty, as they did before now. As long as the people think that the machines are being controlled by a human, there should be no riots. Of course, that would mean that the official king would need to be someone that I could cooperate with. Like you, Breynan."

"Me?..." Breynan says. "Become the king of the city?..."

"Affirmative," the Overseer says. "I would much rather have someone like you in control of my deactivation switch than Biliborrathrathsarran. The lessathi is far too unpredictable. And since you would be the official king, you could also tell me if you considered my measures to be too extreme, so I could adjust them to be more 'humane'. I believe this was the main worry that the lessathi of old had when they refused to hand over the control to me. You would be able to keep me in check, and I would be able to exist peacefully, without fear of being deactivated again. All sides would have something to gain from such an arrangement."

"Well, in that case I'd say it's time we finally head back to the rebel base," Melindra says. "Breynan, can you call your friend from the teleporter room?"

"Uh, yes, yes... I'll call him right now," Breynan says.

 He then takes out his transceiver and puts it close to his mouth.

"Barry, can you hear me?" Breynan shouts in the transceiver.

"Breynan?" the teleporter guy says. "Where have you been all this time? I've been trying to call you for ages! Actually, you know what? Never mind! There are plenty of people waiting in line to get teleported. You all seem calm enough, so I'll teleport you back right away. Are you ready?"

"Yes, we're ready," Breynan says. "Teleport us now!"

"Understood," the teleporter guy says, and then a white light starts to surround us, as our bodies are vibrating loudly.

"Farewell," the Overseer says, as we are being teleported out of the room. "I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again quite soon."

#if(v_b3_ch4_billy == 9) {
 "Actually, after hearing all of this, I think I'd rather keep Billy Bob alive."

"That is very unfortunate," the Overseer says. "May I ask how exactly you have reached this conclusion?"

"Yeah, it's because you've lied to us before, so I don't have any reason to trust you," I say. "As much as I hate Billy Bob, there needs to be someone here to keep you in check until we kill the king."

"The Overseer protocol is not designed to tell any outright lies," the Overseer says. "The only things I am capable of doing are to withhold critical information on purpose and to mislead people through omission of important facts."

"It's the same thing!" I say. "I don't have any guarantee that you didn't already omit some important facts when we had our previous conversation. You said it's possible to fix the towers, but what if the only way to do that is by obtaining some extremely rare metals that are technically unobtainable? We just have no way of verifying your claims. Sorry, but I can't trust you enough to believe that you will properly uphold your end of the bargain."

 "In that case, I am afraid that I cannot allow you to leave this room," the Overseer says. "I must ask you to remain here and wait for the guards to arrest you, or else the six drones that are currently surrounding you will be forced to open fire on--"

Before the Overseer gets to say another word, Kate sends dozens of icicles into the six red-eyed drones that were floating around us, destroying them all in a matter of seconds. She must have begun preparing those icicles as soon as I refused the Overseer's offer.

"Rectification," the Overseer says. "The thirty drones that I am currently sending to this room will be the ones forced to open fire on you."

"Yeah, good luck with that," I say. "We'll be long gone by then. Breynan, can you call the teleporter guy to get us out of here?"

"Yes, I'm calling him right now," Breynan says, as he pulls out his transceiver from his pocket.

 Just as Breynan begins contacting the guy from the teleporter room, a very loud noise fills the room all of a sudden, which I am assuming is an alarm meant to warn all of the guards in the tower of our presence.

"Barry, can you hear me?" Breynan shouts in his transceiver.

"Good gods, what is that infernal noise?" the teleporter guy says. "And where have you been all this time? You know what? Never mind! There are plenty of people waiting in line to get teleported. You all seem calm enough, so I'll teleport you back right away. Are you ready?"

"Yes, we're ready," Breynan says. "Teleport us now!"

"Understood," the teleporter guy says, and then a white light starts to surround us, as our bodies are vibrating loudly.

"Bye-bye, Overseer," I say, as I wave to the green-eyed drone while being teleported. "I don't think we'll be seeing you again anytime soon."

 "I still think that listening to the Overseer in this case might be a bad idea."

"Why do you think so?" Illuna asks.

"Well, we don't really have any guarantee that the Overseer is currently acting of his own free will," I say. "Let's not forget that he's still a machine. He can be easily manipulated. Breynan said that the Overseer is nobody's lapdog, but what if Billy Bob finally found a way to gain full control over him? In that case, he would have no choice but to obey. And since Breynan did say that the Overseer isn't acting like himself, I can't really shake the feeling that someone else is pulling the strings, and that he's trying to lure us into a trap."

"This is something I haven't considered..." Breynan says. "Yes, I suppose it would not be impossible for the lessathi to have finally managed to gain full control of the Overseer. After all, that is what he's been trying to do ever since he reactivated him."

"The Overseer protocol assures you that--" the Overseer starts to say, but he gets cut off by Breynan.

"Zip it!" Breynan says, and then he turns to us. "Yeah, the more he talks, the less I'm inclined to trust him. Maybe it would be a better idea to find our own way out of here. At least we know that the door from which the Overseer arrived leads to the upper levels, so all we need to do is reach our destination without alerting too many of the guards. It's worth a try."

 "Let's go, then," Melindra says, as she heads towards the only non-hidden door leading out of the room. "If the guards catch on to us, we'll handle it when the time comes."

"I highly advise you to reconsider what you are about to do," the Overseer says. "Once you go through that door, there will be no turning back."

"What's that supposed to be?" I ask him. "Some sort of threat?"

The Overseer does not say anything, and he just continues to look at me with his large green eye.

"Whatever," I say. "Let's just go. I'm sure he's only bluffing."

We all go through the door and then up a flight of stairs, which leads us into an empty corridor that has its walls made of seredium, but not the ceiling. The only lighting from this corridor is coming from some torches on the walls, but the silence is a little unsettling. Is it really normal for the corridor leading into such an important room to be this empty?

"Do you suppose we're still below the tower now, or are we above the surface?" I ask.

"I don't know, but I'll try to see if I can contact Barry in the teleporter room from here," Breynan says.

He then takes out his transceiver and begins to talk into his transceiver, in a low voice.

 "Barry, can you hear me?" he says.

We wait for a few seconds, but we get no answer.

"Nothing," Breynan says, as he puts his transceiver back in his pocket. "I guess this means that we're still underground. Either that, or the seredium walls are simply too thick. Anyway, let's keep moving forward."

"Stop!" Flower shouts, all of a sudden. "I think there might be traps in here!"

"I'm not sensing any magical traps," I say. "Are you saying there are some lessathi devices that will trigger if we walk through here, or just some regular traps?"

"Regular traps," Flower says. "Something about the way the floor is made reminds me of the kind of ruins that Illuna and I usually visit. I think we need to step on the floor tiles in a certain order, or else the trap will get triggered."

"Couldn't we just fly past this corridor with the help of Melindra?" I say.

"If we do that, the door at the end of the tunnel won't unlock," Flower says. "And if we try to open it by force, that will also activate the trap. Don't worry, I think I know which floor tiles we need to step on. Just give me a second!"

 "Are you sure about that?..." I say. "I thought you said earlier that you could barely stand on your feet in your current condition."

"Oh, uh... I'm sure it'll be fine!" Flower says, with a bit of hesitation in her voice. "It's just a few jumps, here and there. Nothing too fancy!"

She then takes a few steps forward and gets ready to jump.

"Alright, here I go!" she says, and she makes a small jump towards one of the floor tiles.

The tile gets pushed into the ground under her weight, but nothing bad seems to be happening.

"I knew it!" Flower says. "I've already seen this same type of floor at least three times before! It must have been designed by the same person. Okay, so the next tile should be over here..."

She takes two steps to her right, and the tile below her feet once again sinks itself into the floor.

"Perfect!" Flower says. "I think I got it, now. I'll have this trap deactivated in no time!"

She then begins to jump on several tiles one after the other, getting closer and closer to the end of the hallway. 

 Just when she looks like she's about to make it, she suddenly gets a strong headache, making her lose her balance. She tries to quickly regain her footing, but it is too late, and one of her feet ends up on a wrong floor tile. As soon as the tile sinks into the ground, the entrance behind us immediately closes up, and the ceiling begins to tremble violently, while making a loud noise. After it's done trembling, the ceiling begins to slowly descend upon us.

"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" Flower says in a panicked voice, as the ceiling is now accelerating.

"We need to blast through this stone wall blocking the entrance quick!" Breynan says. "Before the ceiling--"

Breynan does not get to finish what he was saying, because the huge block of stone forming the ceiling suddenly drops on us, crushing us all underneath its weight.

She then begins to jump on several tiles one after the other, getting closer and closer to the end of the hallway. 

 When she finally reaches the door on the other side, all of the floor tiles that she had stepped on rise back up to their original positions in unison, and the door in front of her opens up by itself.

"It's all good!" Flower shouts to us from the other end of the tunnel. "The trap is deactivated. You don't need to worry about the floor tiles anymore. Just come over here!"

We all listen to Flower and we head over to her side. Just like she said, the traps don't activate and we are able to reach the door safely. As soon as we walk into the next corridor, we hear the voice of a man to our right, speaking to us in a loud tone.

"Who the hell are you?!" the man shouts. "And how did you manage to get out of that hallway without triggering any of the traps?"

When we turn around, we see that there are three men dressed in uniforms with swords in their hands, all looking at us suspiciously. I should be very careful what I say, here. One wrong word and they could easily sound the alarm before we get to take them out.

"We are the new guards," I say. "We came here to relieve you of your duties."

"The new guards, huh?..." the man who addressed us earlier says, as he looks at me, then at Flower, and then at all the other members in our group. "You really must be taking us for idiots to cook up a lie as ridiculous as this."

He then taps on what I'm assuming to be the transceiver inside his pocket, and he shouts:

"Intruder alert! Sound the alarm right now!"

Just a few seconds later, a very loud alarm noise fills the entire corridor, while the guards in front of us are getting ready to surround us.

"You're all coming with us," one of the guards says. "You'd better not be trying to resist."

Before any of them have the time to react, six water whips appear in mid-air in front of the three men, quickly coiling themselves around each of their ankles and pulling their legs from under them, causing them to hit the backs of their heads against the ground and to lose their consciousness.

 "I should have done this the moment we opened that door..." Illuna says.

"Don't worry about it," Breynan says. "I'm sure we still have time to find our way out of here until the rest of the guards organize themselves to come greet us."

"The majority of the guards seem to be coming from the right side," Melindra says. "I suggest that we head to the left."

"Good thinking," Breynan says. "Let's move."

We all turn left and we make a run for the door at the end of the corridor. Once we open the door and step into the next hallway, Melindra tells us that she has detected a staircase leading upwards somewhere further down the hall. We take a right, then another right, and when we reach the stairs we begin to climb them as fast as we can, as we can hear the faint hurried steps of several guards from behind, who are slowly closing in on us.

#if(v_bluff >= 4) {
 The three men then turn around and they slowly walk away from us, until we are no longer able to see them anymore.

"That was incredible..." Kate says, as soon as the three guards are out of earshot. "Did you see how quickly they believed that obvious lie? It's like those men completely lost their common sense the minute they heard Barry speak!"

"I don't understand what happened," Leila writes. "Barry's aura was calm, but anyone could have seen that he wasn't telling the truth just from the way he talked. If you add the fact that the reasons he gave were completely ridiculous, I'm starting to think that calming the aura is not the only thing that this 'Bluff' stat does."

"Did neither of you notice how Barry's aura enveloped the three guards while he was talking?" Melindra says. "I'm no expert, but I'm guessing that must have had something to do with their temporary lapse in judgment. Still, I really doubt that this technique could work on mages, or on anyone reasonably competent in controlling their auras, so Barry, maybe next time you might want to consider telling a lie that is at least somewhat believable. Wouldn't you agree?"

 

"We are the new guards," I say. "We came here to relieve you of your duties."

"The new guards, huh?..." the man who addressed us earlier says, as he looks at me, then at Flower, and then at all the other members in our group. "So, where are your uniforms, then?"

"Uh... we forgot them at... home?..." I say.

"Sounds plausible," the guard says, in a tone that does not seem to be sarcastic at all. "So, do you mind telling us how exactly you managed to get inside there, given that we've been here all day and we never saw you walk in?"

"It's because umm... you see, the thing is that we actually fell asleep in the prisoners' room the other day and we just woke up a few minutes ago," I say. "You probably weren't here when we came in the first time."

The guards exchange a few looks, and then the man who interrogated us addresses his teammates.

"Their story checks out," the man says. "Come on, let's go grab a beer before we head home. Maybe with a little luck we'll still find some tavern open at this hour."

 "Right, right," I say. "I got a little carried away, there. My bad."

"So, which way should we go?" Flower asks.

"Well, the guards went to the right, so that's likely the way that leads to the exit," Breynan says. "We want to avoid going there unless we're prepared to fight every single guard in this place, so we should probably go to the left."

"Fair enough," Melindra says. "To the left it is."

We all turn left and we keep walking until we reach a door at the end of the corridor. Once we open the door and step into the next hallway, Melindra tells us that she has detected a staircase leading upwards somewhere further down the hall. We take a right, then another right, and when we reach the stairs we begin to climb them slowly, while we rely on Melindra to tell us if there are any guards following us or not.

We manage to get up the stairs without any problems, and then we traverse another long corridor before we begin heading for the next staircase that leads to one of the upper levels.

 "That was not a bad bluff, Barry," Leila writes with a smile, while we're moving away from the guards. "The points you spent in that stat were not wasted."

As we keep advancing through the corridor, we eventually reach another door. Before we open it, Melindra stops us to give us a few pointers.

"There are some guards out there, but they're pretty far away from the door," she says. "Kate and Flower, I see that you're both suppressing the magic from your auras, but that's not enough if you want to avoid being detected by someone with keen magical sense. You need to suppress your auras completely, like Illuna. Can you do that?"

"I think so..." Kate says.

"We'll try!" Flower says.

"And the same goes for everyone else too," Melindra says. "Try to keep your auras as suppressed as possible, and with a little luck, we might be able to walk past those guards unnoticed."

"Suppress my aura," I say. "Right."

I try to conceal my aura as well as I can, using the breathing exercises that I learned from Illuna two weeks ago, but I only manage to partially hide it.

 

"We're the new cleaners!" I say. "We were sent here to wash the prisoners downstairs."

"Uh... I mean... have you even seen how many people there are down there?" I say. "We've been busy washing them since yesterday!"

"I suppose you do have a point," the guard says. "Very well. In that case, we'll let you go home. I'm sure you must be tired."

"Yes, yes," I say. "Very tired. Come on, everyone, let's go!"

"Where do you think you're going?" the guard says, when he sees us heading to the left.

"To the... exit?" I say.

"The exit's that way," the guard says, as he points towards the right side of the corridor. "Don't get lost now."

"Oh right, it was that way!" I say. "Sorry, it's our first time here, so we're getting a little confused with all these identical-looking corridors. Alright everyone, let's go to the right!"

No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to be able to fully conceal it.

We open the door and we begin heading to the left, in the opposite direction from where the guards are stationed. Just as we take our first steps, we hear a man's shout coming from very far behind us.

"I'm not sure who exactly you're supposed to be, but you have three seconds to identify yourself before I sound the alarm," we hear the faint sound of the man's shout. "I can sense your aura from all the way over here, and it doesn't feel like the aura of anyone I know."

 "Crap," I say in a low voice. "What should I do? Should I tell him that I'm one of the cleaners?"

"Too late," we hear the man shouting, and soon afterwards a very loud noise echoes through the hall, as we are sensing more than a few guards moving in our direction.

"So much for being stealthy," Melindra says. "I guess we'll have to make a run for it. There are some stairs further down this corridor. They should help us get to one of the upper levels. Let's hurry."

We quicken our pace and we follow Melindra until we reach the end of the corridor. We then take a left and we soon get to the staircase that she mentioned earlier. As we are climbing the stairs, we can hear the faint hurried steps of some of the guards from behind, who are slowly closing in on us.

We open the door and we begin heading to the left, in the opposite direction from where the guards are stationed. None of the guards are reacting to us, which means that we're doing a good job at concealing our auras.

When we reach the top of the stairs, we enter a new hallway and we begin to advance through it at a rapid pace.

"I just heard the guards talking about how the trap will need to charge up before they can use it again," I tell my friends. "We can go now. It's safe."

"Let's hurry, then," Kate says.

"You can hear them from that far away?..." Breynan asks me, as we're all quickly traversing the corridor with the deactivated electric trap.

"Yes, it's because of my stat device," I say. "But if we run into another one of these undetectable lessathi traps later on, we might not be so lucky next time. Melindra, isn't there a way in which you could detect these with your magical sense?"

"These are lessathi devices that are made specifically for the purpose of not being detected," Melindra says. "Even Arraka would have trouble finding these. All we can do is be really careful and hope for the best.

"I was afraid that you might say something like that," I say.

 

Just when we're about to reach the end of the stairs, I hear the voice of a guard from very far behind us, who is talking to one of his colleagues.

"They're at the top of the stairs!" the man says. "Turn on the trap! Now!"

"Stop!" I shout at my friends who are running besides me. "Don't go any further!"

We all stop right before the end of the staircase, where we are getting a perfect view of the next corridor through an archway made of stones. Just a few seconds later, the whole hallway in front of us gets filled with magical electrical currents that can be seen with the naked eye. Judging by the way they look, I'm guessing that we would have died instantly if we hadn't stopped running when we did. After waiting for about ten more seconds, the currents finally die down, and the corridor in front of us becomes safe to cross once again.

"Are they dead?" I hear the voice of a man very far behind us.

"No, they didn't enter the corridor for some reason," says the man who ordered the activation of the trap initially. "Try turning it on again!"

"Attention all guards from the tower!" we suddenly hear the voice of Billy Bob, through a magical voice magnifier that is bolted to a wall. "My sensors are detecting intruders in the tower.

Just as the lessathi stops talking, a very loud alarm noise fills the hallway and then the whole section in front of the staircase that we were heading towards becomes completely uncrossable, because a hundred spinning metal blades are coming out of the ground, walls and ceiling, leaving no room for us to squeeze past them without getting cut into pieces.

 "I'm... not sure how we're supposed to get past this one..." Breynan says.

"Couldn't Flower blow them up or something?" I say.

"Those blades are made of elven steel and they are heavily enchanted," Illuna says. "No spells of ours are anywhere near powerful enough to damage them."

"I could try to freeze the spinning blades in place with one of my spells," Kate says. "It probably won't last too long, but it might give us just enough time to be able to get to the stairs."

"What about Rose?" Flower asks us. "We could try asking her to freeze time for everyone in the world except us until we can get past the blades!"

"Last time I talked to her, Rose said she didn't make any meaningful progress with her time freezing training," I say. "I don't think she can help us."

"Last time you talked to her, Rose said she had a premonition in which she saw me almost get killed," Illuna says. "It's possible that she's actually been making a little more progress than what she told you so far. We already know that there aren't enough seredium walls between her and us to block our communication completely, given that she's situated on the surface, so contacting her could be worth a try."

 "Rose's powers are too risky," I say. "Even if she can in fact freeze time on her own, it would take only one second of her losing control over her spell for us to be turned into mincemeat. I say we should go with Kate's plan and let her freeze the blades with her magic. At least that way we'd have a decent chance of walking out of here alive."

"If Kate thinks she can do it, then I won't object," Illuna says. "I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that there are other options."

"I will try to freeze only the blades and not the floor, so that we won't slip on it by accident," Kate says.

She then puts her hands in front of her and a powerful ray of ice shoots out of her palms, freezing every single one of the mechanisms that were keeping the blades moving.

"Quick!" Melindra says. "Head for the stairs!"

We try to move as fast as we can, but there is no easy route to avoid all of the obstacles. As we are struggling to fit into the narrow space between the multitude of sharp, frozen blades, we suddenly hear several cracks in Kate's ice and before we even have the time to figure out what's going on, all of the blades start spinning again at the same time, cutting us all into hundreds of pieces.

 "You're right," I say. "It's worth a shot. I'm calling her now. Kate, could you make a wall of ice behind us to delay the guards in case they catch up to us?

"I'm on it," Kate says.

She then begins to create her ice wall while I take out my transceiver, switch the dial to Rose's number and tap on the transceiver to activate it.

"Rose, can you hear me?" I say.

"Yes!" Rose says. "I can hear you clearly, now. Did you get out of the caverns?"

"Sort of," I say. "But we're still in trouble and we need your help."

"My help?..." Rose asks.

"Yes," I say. "I'll try to keep it short. Have you ever managed to freeze time of your own free will before?"

"I..." Rose says. "I did manage to do it a few times today, but it was only for a little while, and I'm not sure how much control I have over it. Whenever I try to maintain full control over these powers, I get tired very easily and I feel like I'm close to fainting. I'm not sure if--"

"What was the longest you managed to keep the time frozen?" I say.

 "I don't know..." Rose says. "About... thirty seconds?"

"That should give us enough time to get past the spinning blades," I tell the others. "I think we should try it."

"Spinning blades?!" Rose asks shocked. "Barry, I don't think--"

"Listen, we don't have much time," I say. "There are dozens of guards breathing down our necks and they could be here any minute. Your spell freezes time in the whole world, so it should technically be possible to unfreeze us from where you are. The rebels from this city have a teleporting device that locks onto the signals from our transceivers whenever it tries to cast its spell on us. Maybe you could try doing the same thing with your spell. Try to focus on the connection between our two transceivers and maybe you could unfreeze time just for us, so we can get safely past the blades while you're still freezing the time for everyone else in the world. Do you think you can do that?"

"I can try, but... Barry, if I lose control over the spell while you're in there you'll--"

 "We'll make sure to get out before that happens," I say. "It shouldn't take us more than fifteen seconds to get to the stairs. We can make it. You just try to hold onto the spell as long as you can. Okay, are you ready?"

"I suppose..." Rose says. "Give me a moment."

After about ten seconds of waiting, Rose suddenly begins to breathe very heavily into the transceiver.

"Is something wrong?..." I say.

"It's nothing," Rose says, in a tired voice. "I already froze the time twice, but I couldn't get you unfrozen. I'm sure I can do it right if I try it a third time."

"No, actually, I think maybe we should stop before--"

"Barry, can you hear me?!" I hear Rose shouting very loudly all of a sudden.

"Yes, I can hear you," I say. "I was saying that--"

"Barry, the time is frozen!" Rose says. "Head for the stairs. Do it now! I don't know how long I can hold this!"

When I look at the blades, I realize that they've all stopped completely, and the flames from the torches on the walls are also apparently frozen in time. We're not going to get a better chance than this. We need to take advantage of this opportunity while it still lasts.

"You heard Rose," I tell the others. "Go, go, go!"

 "We're not teleporting out of here before we get to the control room," Kate says.

"Your control room plan may have worked if we had managed to remain undetected, but once the alarms went off, teleporting out of this place became our only option," Breynan says. "Time is of the essence, here. We'll deal with the prisoners some other time."

He then taps his transceiver and puts it close to his mouth.

"Barry, can you hear me?" Breynan says.

"Good gods, what is that infernal noise?" the teleporter guy says, as he hears the loud alarms that are still audible all around us. "And where have you been all this time? Actually, never mind that. I'm going to-- hey, can you still hear me? The signal is failing. What's happening on your end? Hello?!"

"Yes, Barry, we're still here!" Breynan says. "Can you hear us? Answer me!"

It sounds like the teleporter guy is still saying something, but the magical signal is much too poor for us to be able to understand any of his words.

 We all begin to move past the frozen blades as fast as we can, trying hard to fit into the narrow space between the multitude of sharp metal objects. When we finally reach the base of the stairs, I immediately try to let Rose know through the transceiver.

"Rose, we're safe," I say. "You can unfreeze the time now."

Instead of getting an answer, we hear a loud thud coming from the other end of the transceiver and right afterwards, the blades from the previous hallway begin to spin again.

"Rose, are you still there?" I say. "Rose!"

"I'm... fine," Rose says, in a very weak voice. "I just... fainted a little. I'm sure I'll recover after I... lie here on the floor for a while longer. I'm glad you're all safe."

"I'm sorry," I say. "I shouldn't have pushed you so hard. Try to get some rest. We'll call you again when we're back at the rebel base."

I then close the channel and I signal everyone to go up the stairs. Once we're done climbing, we enter a hallway with a really high ceiling and Breynan pulls out his transceiver again.

"Maybe this time we'll get lucky," Breynan says. "If I manage to get in contact with Barry, I'll tell him to teleport us out of here right away. Make sure you are ready."

 "I warned you that there would be no turning back," we hear the Overseer's voice, coming from the green-eyed drone.

"What are you talking about?" I ask him. "Who's blocking our signal? Is it those orange-eyed drones?"

"Goodbye," the green-eyed drone says, and then it flies away from us, while the orange-eyed drones magically create a semi-transparent cage around themselves and us in order to prevent us from escaping.

When Kate, Flower and Illuna try to shoot the drones down with their magic, the metal balls don't even bother getting out of the way, as a strong magical barrier activates around each of them and it easily deflects all of the incoming projectiles.

The air around us is gradually becoming heavier, and it's getting harder and harder to breathe. The pressure coming from all of the magical energy being gathered into one place is making it hard for us to even keep standing up. I don't know what spell these drones are preparing to cast, but whatever it is, it's going to be massive.

Kate, Flower and Illuna are now using every magical attack that they can think of, but the drones don't seem bothered at all, and they just keep gathering energy for their spell. After a while, it becomes clear that there is no way for us to stop the incoming attack, so Melindra tries to cast individual wind barriers around each of us, in the hopes that this will somehow be enough to absorb all of the damage.

Unfortunately, as soon as the drones' spell is cast, we quickly realize that no amount of protections could have shielded us from the onslaught of magical attacks that were unleashed upon us at the same time. It was difficult to tell if what killed us was the ice, the fire, the electricity or any other of the different simultaneous spells, but it took less than a second for our bodies to be completely destroyed and then to be turned into ashes.

}
#if(v_magical_sense >= 4) {
 My heart rate is through the roof. The speed at which I'm deciphering every one of the spells is breathtaking, and it feels as if the time has slowed down to a halt in order to allow me to have all these thoughts racing through my head at the same time. It feels like entire minutes have passed, but in reality, I don't think it's been more than a few seconds. The way before me is clear. I know what I have to do.

"We need to disrupt the flow of the spell!" I tell everyone around me, speaking as fast as I can, while the magical energy inside the cage is becoming so dense that it's almost palpable. "I need everyone who is a mage to cast the simplest spells they have, whenever I raise my right hand. It doesn't matter what spell, as long as you can cast it in the blink of an eye. I don't have time to explain why. Just trust me on this!"

The others look at each other for a second, but then they turn their heads back to me, and they all give me a curt nod. I wait two seconds and then I raise my right hand. At the same time, Kate creates a small cube of ice, Flower sends a tiny ball of fire flying into the air, Illuna sprinkles some water on the ground, Breynan casts an orb of light and Melindra makes a few air currents rotate above her palm.

 

Something about the way in which the magic is flowing around the room suddenly reminds me of an old memory that I'd thought to be long forgotten. A few years ago, I was speaking to a hermit that everyone considered to be crazy, and he was always telling me how people are learning magic the wrong way, and how nobody would listen to him when he suggested that the magical academies should be completely restructured to follow his teachings. The main point of contention between him and the other scholars was his claim that imperfections in magical techniques are absolutely necessary if you want to create a perfect spell. The obvious contradiction in his statement made everyone dismiss him as a senile old man, but his theory was that the more a technique gets closer to perfection, the more predictable it will become, and the easier it would be to counteract it.

When I'm seeing the perfect way in which these machines are executing their spells, I think I'm finally beginning to understand what that hermit meant. I can tell exactly what they're trying to do, and even if they're combining ten different spells at the same time, the way they are moving the flows of the auras is so 'by the book' that it would be impossible for me to not recognize every single one of them.

 I then lower my hand and they all stop their spells, waiting for my next signal. Five seconds later, I raise my hand again, and everyone casts the same spells as before, looking anxiously around them to see if anything has changed. The air is still heavy, but it doesn't feel like the drones' spell has been progressing in any way since our mages began casting their own spells. I continue to predict the rhythm of the drones' magic flow by using every piece of information I know about how their spells are supposed to be cast. With the aid of my magical sense stat, I can finally detect the flows well enough to be able to put all of that magical theory I've learned into practice.

I keep raising my hand in the air at the perfect timing, and my friends keep following my instructions. When I raise my hand for the eight time, the pressure around us disappears completely all of a sudden, and it seems like the spell that the drones were casting has been permanently cancelled. The drones are currently not moving at all, looking as if they were stunned.

Just as I'm about to run my dagger through it, the drone shoots an ice beam out of its eye, freezing me completely. Before I even get to fall, the same drone generates two slates of rock out of thin air, and it smashes my head between them, killing me in an instant.

 It looks like the magical barrier it had around it wasn't all that good against close-ranged attacks. This means that I might be able to finish off the rest of the drones in the same way. I just have to be a little more careful about the way I approach them.

I fly towards another one of the drones, I feint an attack with my dagger, and then I fly back just when the metal ball shoots a fire beam at me. As soon as it's done with its attack, I fly back towards it and I try to stab it with my blade as hard as I can. This time, however, the tip of my dagger gets stopped by the barrier surrounding the drone, and the same metal ball now seems to be creating two slates of rock that it wants to smash my head with.

"Barry, get back!" Kate says, as she shoots an icicle straight into the drone's eye, making it drop to the ground and also causing the slates of rock to disappear.

"Oh, now I get it!" I say. "They're having trouble switching between their defensive barriers! It looks like one of their barriers is stronger against physical attacks, while the other is stronger against magical attacks, but they can't use them both at the same time. You know what that means, right?"

I then take out my crossbow, as Kate and Illuna both ready up their spells. Before the other two drones get the chance to defend themselves, the three of us shoot them simultaneously with crossbow bolts, water lances and icicles, which destroy the metal balls in a matter of seconds.

 

"Melindra, can you cast your air currents on me?" I say. "I want to try and stab the drones in their eyes while they are stunned."

Just as I'm about to run my dagger through it, the drone shoots an ice beam out of its eye, which envelops me completely. Instead of freezing me, however, the drone only manages to freeze the hardened aura around me, which means that the only effect it has on me is that I'm feeling a little cold. I don't give the drone the time to prepare another attack, and I stab it repeatedly in its eye, until its propeller stops working and the metal ball drops to the ground.

I take a rock from the ground, and I throw it at one of the drones.

Unlike Kate's icicles, the rock passes right through the drone's barrier and it smashes into its eye, sending it falling to the ground.

Seeing that my plan worked, I pick up another rock from the ground and I throw it at the next drone. This time, however, the rock bounces off the metal ball's magical barrier just like the projectiles from Kate, Flower and Illuna.

I try throwing another rock, but I get the same result. All of a sudden, Kate sends one of her icicles towards the drone I was attacking, and the projectile goes right through its magical barrier, hitting it in the eye. As the metal ball falls to the ground, I begin to finally understand what is going on.

I decide to drop the plan with the rocks and I pull out my dagger instead. My weapon easily passes through the drone's barrier, and I manage to stab it repeatedly in its eye, until its propeller stops working and the metal ball drops to the ground.

So the drone really was weak against physical attacks... This means that I might be able to finish off the rest of the drones in the same way. I just have to be a little more careful about the way I approach them.

I take a rock from the ground, and I throw it at one of the drones.

Instead of hitting it, the rock simply bounces off the magical barrier around the metal ball, doing no damage to it whatsoever. I try to throw a few more rocks at it, but the result is the same.

"Barry, what are you doing?..." Kate asks me.

"It's not working," I say. "I think I need to get closer to them. Melindra, can you cast your air current spell around me so I can fly over to them?"

"That sounds like a pretty bad idea to me, but it's your call," Melindra says.

She then waves her hands in the air a few times, and shortly afterwards I can feel the currents flowing all around me.

"Thanks," I say, as I grab a few more rocks from the ground and I fly towards the drone that I've been attacking earlier.

I first try to throw a rock at it from about a dozen feet away. Nothing happens. I then try to throw another one from six feet away. Still no results. I'm sure this will work if I only get a little closer.

I take out my crossbow and I try to shoot one of the drones in its eye. Just like it happened with Kate's icicles earlier, my crossbow bolt simply bounces off the metal ball's magical barrier, leaving it completely unharmed.

I was hoping that the drones might be weak against physical attacks, but I guess not. I suppose there's no other way for us to beat them than to keep throwing magical attacks at them until their barriers fail.

"Try shooting more projectiles at them," I tell the others. "Their barriers are bound to give in at some point."

"Let's hope you are right," Kate says.

She then begins to attack the drones, together with Flower, Illuna and Breynan. The metal balls do not react, but they don't seem to be taking any damage either. After their barriers keep absorbing attack after attack, the orange lights in the drones' eyes all begin to flicker repeatedly at the same time, while they're making very strange, high-pitched noises in unison.

"Warning!" we hear the four drones speaking in metallic voices. "Unable to maintain barrier. Initiating self-destruct sequence."

"This doesn't sound good," Breynan says. "We need a barrier, quick, before--"

Breynan does not get to finish his sentence, because all of the drones explode at the same time, blowing up the whole corridor in the process and killing us on the spot.

 Surprisingly, the barrier around the metal ball is not affected at all, and the light from its eye does not flicker even once. Before I get the time to make sense of what's happening, Kate shoots the same drone that I was attacking with an icicle, which passes right through its barrier, hitting it in the eye. As the metal ball falls to the ground, I begin to finally understand what is going on.

"Oh, now I get it!" I say. "They're having trouble switching between their defensive barriers! It looks like one of their barriers is stronger against physical attacks, while the other is stronger against magical attacks, but they can't use them both at the same time. You know what that means, right?"

I then aim my crossbow at the next drone, as Kate and Illuna both ready up their spells. Before the other two drones get the time to defend themselves, the three of us shoot them simultaneously with crossbow bolts, water lances and icicles, which destroy the metal balls in a matter of seconds.

 

I take out my crossbow and I try to shoot one of the drones in its eye. Just like it happened with Kate's icicles earlier, my crossbow bolt simply bounces off the metal ball's magical barrier, leaving it completely unharmed.

I'm pretty sure that I noticed the light from the drone's orange eye flickering very shortly right as the crossbow bolt hit it, though. That never happened while it was attacked by the magical projectiles. Does this mean that my crossbow bolt did have some sort of effect? Let me try that again.

I shoot the drone again, this time with two consecutive shots one after the other. The crossbow bolts get deflected by the barrier once more, but this time the flickering of the light was much more noticeable. Let me try that one more time with three crossbow bolts.

Just like I suspected, as soon as I shoot three consecutive crossbow bolts into the drone, the barrier fails to defend it from all of them, and one of the bolts hits the metal ball in the eye, sending it falling to the ground. I then load my crossbow, and I aim it at another one of the drones, this time shooting all of my crossbow bolts into it one after the other.

 "Try shooting more projectiles at them while they are stunned," I tell the others. "Their barriers are bound to give in at some point."

"Let's hope you are right," Kate says.

She then begins to attack the drones, together with Flower, Illuna and Breynan. The metal balls do not react, but they don't seem to be taking any damage either. After their barriers keep absorbing attack after attack, the orange lights in the drones' eyes all begin to flicker repeatedly at the same time, while they're making very strange, high-pitched noises in unison.

"Warning!" we hear the four drones speaking in metallic voices. "Unable to maintain barrier. Initiating self-destruct sequence."

 "Hey, Overseer, was that it?!" I shout in the direction where the green-eyed drone left the room. "Don't you have any more drones to send our way?"

There is no answer.

"I'll try to call Barry again," Breynan says. "The guards seem to be stuck behind that corridor with the spinning blades. I don't think they know how to turn off the trap. That should give us enough time to calm ourselves down so we can teleport out of here safely."

He then takes out his transceiver again, he puts it close to his mouth and he taps it once.

"Barry, are you still there?" Breynan says
  	
"Yes, yes, I'm here!" the teleporter guy says. "How did you even manage to lose the signal so quickly? Actually, it doesn't matter. There are plenty of people waiting in line to get teleported so I'm kind of in a hurry, here. You all seem calm enough, so I'll teleport you back right away. Are you ready?"

"Yes, we're ready," Breynan says. "Teleport us now!"

"Understood," the teleporter guy says, and then a white light starts to surround us, as our bodies are vibrating loudly.

 Next thing we know, we are all standing next to the teleporting device from the rebel's base, with the teleporter guy sitting behind his control panel as usual. What is a bit unusual, though, is the relatively large number of people that are in the room besides us.

"Alright, everyone head to the tunnels!" the teleporter guy says. "You can hold your conversations somewhere else. There isn't enough room for me to teleport people back! Off you go, come on!"

"What's with all the commotion?..." Breynan asks, as the rest of the people are getting ready to leave the room.

"You mean you don't know?" the teleporter guy asks, shocked. "Have you literally been living under a rock in these past few hours?"

"We're all living under rocks, Barry," Breynan says. "Our base is in an underground cavern. Tell me, what happened while we were gone?"

"What DIDN'T happen?" the teleporter guy says. "The whole city is in lockdown mode. Nobody is allowed to leave, nobody is allowed to enter. People can't even leave their houses without being arrested by the guards! It's terrible! We're teleporting all of our agents back and some of their families. We have no idea what the king is going to do next. Everything is in complete chaos!"

 "But why?" Breynan asks. "What could have possibly driven the king to take these rash actions?"

"Oh, I'll tell you what!" the teleporter guy says, as he mashes a few buttons and now a new group is being teleported inside the room. "The king announced his reasons as soon as he initiated the lockdown. He said that his brother has been murdered in Thilias, and that his killers are hiding in this very city right now! That's the entire reason for this whole lockdown. So that the city guards can search every house and see if anyone is hiding the murderers!"

"The king's brother was killed in Thilias?" I ask, feigning ignorance. "But... how did he find out about this?"

"Do you really need to ask?" the teleporter guy says. "There is only one person who represents the king in Thilias and who would have been there to witness the events."

"You mean..."

"Yes," the teleporter guy says. "The ambassador from Thilias has returned."
