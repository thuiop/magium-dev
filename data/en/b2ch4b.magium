 "Wait, who are you, and what are you doing here?" Bruce says, as he finally notices the lessathi in the dark blue robe.

"I am a last minute addition to your division," the lessathi says. "I just got captured this morning."

"Huh," Bruce says. "Well, tough luck, then. I hope you're good at fighting, because it's going to be a rough ride."

"I will manage," the lessathi says.

We hear a lion's roar coming from beyond the gates leading to the creatures' den. Two manticores walk out of the den, and then they immediately soar to the sky, just like the ones that fought the first division. Coming from behind them, three desert marauders are now making their way into the fighting area as well. But those aren't the only beasts that are coming our way. Two giant acid-spitting cobras are now also slithering their way out of the den, and if my ears are not failing me, I think I can also hear the sounds of a few tramplers, getting ready to charge towards us.

 "For this fight, we are going to try something a little different," the announcer says. "The members of the fourth division will have to fight not two, not three, but four different types of our strongest creatures, and they'll have to kill them all if they want to advance to the next round. This change in our schedule was a personal request from our esteemed arena owner, mister Venard."

That bastard. Is this his way of telling me that in order to make it out of here alive, I'll need to outperform both Hadrik and Daren? You have got to be kidding me!

"Just make sure that you all follow my orders, and everything will be alright!" Bruce says.

"I knew it!" the ex-noble thug says. "I knew that you would start playing leader as soon as we'd get into the arena. I already told you, nobody is going to listen to you. So you can take your orders and shove them up your arse!"

 "Is this really the time and place to be having this argument?"

"So, what do you propose to do, smart-ass?" the thug says. "Bow down to the all-mighty and powerful Bruce and accept his every command?"

"No," I say. "I'm proposing that you shut the hell up and--"

I stop talking mid-sentence because the blue robed lessathi suddenly makes a run towards the creatures, all by himself, with his scythes at the ready.

"That crazy fool!" Bruce says. "Does he have a death wish?"

The cobras see the lessathi, and they both spit in his direction. The lessathi dodges the spray of acid, and he moves to stab one of the cobras with his scythes. As soon as he stabs it, the giant snake falls on the ground, unconscious, and then he also stabs the second cobra, in the same manner, sending it falling to the ground almost as quickly as the first one.

One of the manticores sees this as an opportunity to attack, so it dives down with great speed, in an attempt to grab the lessathi in its claws. The lessathi, however, was expecting this to happen, so he waits for the manticore to reach down to his level, and then he impales it with both his scythes, causing the creature to tremble and scream for a few seconds, and then to fall silent, as it hits the ground, lifeless.

"What the hell is he doing?" the thug asks. "What kind of enchantments could he possibly be using on those scythes to kill those monsters off so quickly?"

 The lessathi does not wait for the tramplers to begin their charge, and he chooses to engage them in close quarters, in order to limit their mobility. The desert marauders are now also joining the battle, and it looks as if they're aiming to surround him. To make matters worse, the manticore decides to join the fight as well, and it dives down towards the lessathi, closing off his last remaining escape route.

"Get out of there!" Bruce shouts at him. "Get out now!"

The lessathi shows no sign of having heard Bruce. Instead, he waits for the last possible moment, when the marauders, the tramplers and the manticore are all within a few feet from his position, and he thrusts both his scythes fiercely into the ground. Almost immediately afterwards, we see a powerful electric shockwave cover the whole area around him, and the creatures that were about to attack him only a second ago, are now all dropping like flies, to the ground.

Electricity! So, that's what he was using! 

The crowds are definitely not liking what they just saw. Several spectators have started booing loudly, and more of them are beginning to join the chorus, as the booing sound is slowly intensifying.

I quickly turn around, and I see Wilhelm, holding his orange hilted dagger in both hands, looking as if he'd been just seconds away from delivering a finishing blow.

"What are you doing, Wilhelm?" I tell him.

Wilhelm seems almost frozen. He keeps holding onto his dagger with both hands as if he were still about to attack me, but now that I'm facing him directly, all of his assassin instincts must be telling him to retreat, instead.

"Wilhelm, put that weapon away before you hurt yourself," I tell him.

 "Ladies and gentlemen," the announcer says, in an attempt to silence the crowd that will not stop booing, "I assure you that I am just as perplexed by this turn of events as the rest of you. I fully realize what this looks like, but we cannot confirm that our rules have been broken until we conduct a thorough investigation, in order to understand why our magical detectors were not set off. Until then, this mysterious participant will remain in our custody. Thank you for your understanding."

"Well..." Bruce says. "I guess the first round's over, then... Let's go back."

As we all head back, we run into the owner of the arena, who was waiting for us at the entrance to our division's area.

"May I have an explanation for all of this?" the owner says, looking straight at the lessathi. "Who told you that you could just come in here and interfere with this arena event?"

"You know very well who did," the lessathi says. "And you'd do well to step aside, and let me pass, if you know what's good for you."

"How did you manage to fool the magic detectors?" the owner says.

"Did you forget who provided you with those magical detectors in the first place?" the lessathi says. "I only had to make a few small tweaks prior to the event, in order to get those devices to ignore electricity."

 "You are not to interfere with this event any longer, do you understand?" the owner says, furiously. "I want you out of here, right this instant!"

"Are you sure?" the lessathi asks him, with a menacing tone.

"Get out!" the owner tells him.

"Very well," the lessathi says. "Then you will not be seeing me again. You should, however, expect to see some of my associates in the next few days. And when you do, you should be ready to face the consequences for your actions today."

The lessathi leaves without another word, and the arena owner goes back to his room shortly afterwards. The six of us then re-enter our division area, and the iron gate closes itself behind us. After taking a good look throughout the room, it would seem that Wilhelm is nowhere to be found.

"Where do you suppose Wilbert went?" Bruce says.

"Nobody cares," the ex-noble thug says. "There's plenty of time left until the next round. He'll probably come back until then."

"Uh..." the announcer says, all of a sudden. "It appears that we need to take a small break, in order to do a little inventory of our remaining creatures. Please remain patient! This shouldn't take long!"

Well, if my speed isn't good enough, then I'll just have to overpower it through brute strength.

Given that I don't know any of its specific weaknesses, I'm going to have to assume that its head and its eyes, in particular, are the least durable parts of its body, but if I try to get to the head, the marauder will probably block my access with its claws, and then finish me off with its tail.

I'm so glad that Daren enchanted this dagger before the arena. I wouldn't even have imagined myself cutting off a giant scorpion's claw in a single strike before I experienced the sharpness of this blade first hand. Now that one of its claws is gone, the scorpion can no longer block me from approaching. I attack the marauder from the right side, where its claw is missing, and I dash for its head. The scorpion tail is not made to defend from lateral attacks, so the creature does not manage to fend me off before I stab it in its right eye.

Even with Daren's enchanted dagger, my strikes are not strong enough to be able to cut off a claw. After clashing with the marauder for about ten seconds, the creature manages to catch me on the wrong footing, and it quickly attacks me with its tail.

My hand moves on its own, and I parry the marauder's strike with my knife, right above my head. As soon as the monster retracts its tail, I see an opening in the creature's defenses, and I rush forward, not stopping until I stab it in its right eye.

Even with Daren's enchanted dagger, my strikes are not strong enough to be able to cut off a claw. After clashing with the marauder for about ten seconds, the creature manages to catch me on the wrong footing, and it quickly attacks me with its tail.

There was no time for me to react. The tail impaled me straight through my head, and I barely got to see it coming before I was already dead.

 No, wait... this isn't over, yet. 

I look up, and I see that one of the manticores is now diving straight at me. I knew it! The manticore was waiting for me to kill something before attacking me. They were doing the same thing in Hadrik's fight, and in the one before.

 I jump out of the manticore's way, and then I slash at its wing with my knife, in order to cut off the feathers that it needs to fly properly. 

The creature tries flying away, but it no longer manages to gain altitude, and it crashes to the ground. I give the beast no time to recover, and I jump at it with my dagger, slitting its throat in one move.

Suddenly, I get a vision of a manticore diving towards me, at great speed. I look up, to confirm my suspicions, then I immediately jump backwards, and I slash at the manticore's wing with my knife, in order to cut off the feathers that it needs to fly properly.

 Perfect! Two creatures are already down. But what about Wilhelm? Is he trying to kill me, yet?

I turn around and see, to my surprise, that Wilhelm was not there. He was instead taking cover behind one of the creature carcasses, probably in order to defend himself from a potential trampler charge. I guess that my threat was more effective than I thought!

Leila is just about to reach me, and she sends one of her blue texts ahead of her, in order to save time.

"You could have at least asked me to come with you," the writing says, while Leila is looking towards me, with an upset look on her face.

"Sorry about that!" I tell her, as she stops in front of me. "I didn't think you'd want to join me."

"So, which one do we kill first?" Leila writes.

Before I get to decide, I hear the sound of something dropping to the ground behind me, and I turn around to see what happened. From what I can gather, it would seem that Wilhelm is the one that's been knocked out, and Leila is the one who hit him. Wilhelm was right behind me, and he was holding an orange hilted dagger before Leila took him out. If my memory does not fail me, orange hilted daggers are typically used by trained assassins, and they are enchanted weapons that help conceal one's aura. Does this mean that Wilhelm was an assassin?

"Wait, what happened to Wilhelm?" I ask her.

"I thought it would be self-explanatory," Leila writes. "He was trying to kill you. I knocked him out."

"We should kill that manticore, first," I say. "We can't concentrate on killing the other monsters if we always have to worry about being attacked from above."

"What do you have in mind?" Leila writes.

"I want to throw some spears at it," I tell her, and then I point towards the walls of the arena, which have a wide variety of weapons mounted on them, including spears.

"Okay, but let's hurry up!" Bruce says. "These beasts look like they could be jumping on us any second now."

We go around the marauders, and we head towards the arena wall which is closer to us, while making sure to never take our eyes off the tramplers and the cobras. When we reach it, I take a spear off the wall, and I throw it at the manticore. My hit was right on target, and the spear pierced the manticore's chest, killing the beast in mid-flight and sending it falling to the ground.

 The crowds burst into cheers. Actually, I think they've been cheering for a while, now. It's just that I've been too focused on the battle to notice. 

While we were dealing with the manticore, the tramplers have taken the opportunity to reposition themselves, and they are now getting ready to charge towards us at full speed. The cobras are heading our way as well. The scorpions seem to have given up on us, and they are heading towards the other members of our team.

 I start making my way towards my targets as well, and as the cobras see me approaching, the two of them stop in their tracks and prepare to engage me.

Remember their behavior. The cobras need at least two seconds to take aim. As long as I make sure that I never stop moving sideways, they shouldn't be able to hit me. But that alone won't give me an opening. I need to be a little more inventive than that.

I decide to bait the cobras by standing in one place for two seconds, and then jumping out of the way, thus making sure that both creatures miss their shots and waste their acid. While the two snakes are busy gathering up more acid in their glands, I take advantage of the situation, and I dash towards the one on the right, stabbing it in the head, and killing it with one strike. The other snake tries to lunge at me, in order to bite my head off, but I easily anticipate its attack from the way it moved its body, and I step out of its way, delivering the finishing blow with my blade shortly afterwards.

I take a look to see how Leila is doing, but it appears that she's already dealt with both the tramplers, and she's now heading my way.

"I want us to lure the cobras here, near the marauders," I say. "We'll then face the cobras with our backs turned to the marauders, and when they spit their acid, we jump out of the way, causing the acid to hit the marauders instead. I'm not sure if it will kill them, but we should easily be able to finish them off after that."

"Sounds risky," Leila writes. "If we don't time this right, we could end up either sprayed with acid, or impaled by the marauders from behind."

"But if we time it right, we'll get rid of three monsters in one move," I say. 

"What three monsters?" Leila writes. "There are only two marauders left."

"Yes," I say, "but I'm pretty sure that the manticore up there in the sky will make a dive for you as soon as we kill the marauders. The manticore that went for me last time got killed, so I don't think this one will take the risk to attack me. Just make sure that you're ready for it, and you should be able to kill it without much trouble."

"Alright," Leila writes. "I'll be ready for it."

 "Let's go," I say.

We make our way towards the cobras, and we start throwing rocks at them, and making loud noises, in order to annoy them. Once we're certain that we've got their undivided attention, we begin to go back towards the marauders, making sure that we're moving at just the right speed so the cobras can follow us, but not catch up. When we reach the marauders, we turn our backs to them, and we stand in place for a few seconds, waiting for the cobras to attack.

Those few seconds feel almost like an eternity, but when the cobras finally spit their acid at us, we both jump out of the way at the same time, and the spray of acid hits the marauders head on. As the beasts squirm in pain, we finish them off quickly, by running our blades through their heads, and then, as I anticipated, the last remaining manticore makes a bold dive towards Leila, thinking that she's distracted. Leila feigns ignorance until the very last moment, and then she makes a powerful slash at the creature's chest, exactly when it reaches her. The manticore drops to the ground, and Leila finishes it off with one swift strike of her dagger. While the cobras are busy gathering more acid in their glands, the two of us distance ourselves from the snakes, in order to decide our next course of action.

 As I look towards the other members of my team, I see that they aren't doing all that well. Both the thugs seem to be dead, and while they appear to have somehow managed to kill one of the marauders, the mage is currently being chased by the second one, and it doesn't look like he has any chance of turning the tide, by himself. 

I signal Leila and Bruce, and we head towards the last marauder, in order to finish it off. Given that there are three of us this time, it doesn't take long for us to deal with it, and once the marauder falls to the ground, the crowd explodes in a burst of cheers like never before.

 "Everyone, hide behind the monster carcasses!" Bruce says. "That way, the tramplers won't be able to charge at us."

"Well, what do you know!" Wilhelm says. "The brute can actually say some sensible things every once in a while!"

We all hide behind some marauder corpses, and we keep watching the battlefield, to see what the creatures are doing. The tramplers are moving around, trying to find a way to charge towards us without any obstacles in their path. The cobras and the marauders have gotten much further away from each other now, and they are likely trying to flank us. The manticores are still flying around, waiting for the best opportunity to strike.

"If we just keep standing here, we're going to get surrounded!" the ex-noble thug's friend says. "We need to go and attack one of the groups now, while they're divided!"

"That will only encourage the tramplers to charge at us!" the mage says. "We should stay here, where we at least have some cover!"

"There are enough monster carcasses between us and the marauders to be able to make it there safely," I say. "We can make quick sprints and take cover behind each one of the corpses until we reach our targets. Then we'll just have to make sure that there's always a marauder between us and the tramplers, and we'll be fine."

#if(v_b2_ch4_backpack == 1) {
 "That... doesn't sound like a bad idea, actually," the mage says.

"Then let's get going," Bruce says. "And remember to keep a look out for the manticores in the sky. There's no telling when they'll take a dive for us."

We all start moving towards the desert marauders in short sprints, stopping behind a monster carcass every time, in order to make sure that the tramplers don't begin charging towards us. As soon as we reach our targets, we position ourselves in a way that blocks us from the tramplers' line of sight, and we begin our attack.

We all start moving towards the desert marauders in short sprints, stopping behind a monster carcass every time, in order to make sure that the tramplers don't begin charging towards us. While we are resting between sprints, I take the opportunity to give everyone a quick summary of the behaviors and weaknesses of desert marauders, so we can all be on the same page when we start fighting them. As soon as we reach our targets, we position ourselves in a way that blocks us from the tramplers' line of sight, and we begin our attack.

 Bruce is the first one to engage the marauders, shouting loudly and swinging his large two handed sword towards them, in an attempt to intimidate them. Leila makes a rush at the marauder that's closer to Bruce, trying to get to its head, but the creature blocks her path with its claws, and it tries to attack her with its tail. She dashes out of the way, and she tries to attack it again, from the side.

One of the marauders charges towards the ex-noble thug, and it tries to impale him with its tail. The thug screams in shock, and he jumps back, but it doesn't look like he's going to get away in time. All of a sudden, Bruce jumps out of nowhere, and he deflects the marauder's tail with his sword, making the creature back up a bit, in order to measure up its new opponent carefully.

"The arena is no place for cowards!" Bruce shouts at the thug. "This is a place for real men! If you're planning to fight like a woman, then get out of my way!"

Bruce then quickly realizes the poor wording of his phrase, and he turns towards Leila, who is now frowning at him.

"Or you can... also fight like a woman if you want..." Bruce says. "Just don't be a coward. You get what I mean."

Bruce and Leila then resume their fight with the other marauder, while Wilhelm is providing support for them.
  
"Hey, you," I say. "Ex-noble thug!"

"What did you just call me?" the thug says, in a menacing tone.

 "Never mind that!" I tell him. "Can you and your thug friend stand over here, and make some loud noises? I need someone to distract that marauder, so I can get behind it. The creature seems to have already taken a liking to you, so you'd make the perfect distraction!"

"Screw you and your distractions!" the thug says. "Do you take me for a fool?"

"If it's just a distraction, then I can handle it," the mage says. "Where do you want me to stand?"

"Over there would be perfect," I tell him, as I point him in the right direction.

The two thugs don't seem to want to be any part of my plan, so they're moving away from us, and joining the others. The mage gets into position, and he starts throwing rocks at the marauder, in order to make it come after him. As soon as he gets the desert marauder's attention, I walk behind the creature and quickly climb on its back.

I'm not exactly sure where this monster's weakness is, but I know that it should be somewhere on the upper side of its back, between two of its scales. I begin to stab the creature repeatedly between its scales, trying to find the weak spot by process of elimination.

Now let's see... If my notes are correct, then giant scorpion-like creatures should have a weak spot right around... here!

I stab the marauder between two of the scales on its back, and the creature starts to scream loudly, while rocking its body back and forth for a few seconds. As it drops to the ground, I seize the opportunity, and I move towards its head, delivering the finishing blow with one quick strike of my knife. I then get down from the marauder's back, and I get ready to join my teammates in dealing with the rest of the creatures.

This isn't working. Why am I even doing this? With my level of strength, and this dagger enchanted by Daren, brute force should be more than enough to break through these armored scales. 

I muster up all of my strength, and I strike at one of the marauder's scales with my dagger. The scale shatters into pieces, and the knife enters deep into the marauder's back, causing it to scream in pain and to wobble uncontrollably from one side to the other.

It doesn't take long until the creature drops to the ground, and a few seconds later, it stops breathing completely.

 Perfect! Two creatures are already down. But what about Wilhelm? Is he trying to kill me, yet?

I turn around and see, to my surprise, that Wilhelm is currently still helping the others to fight the marauders. I guess that my threat from three days ago was far more effective than I thought!

 Perfect! Two creatures are already down. But there's now a new problem that I need to deal with. Ever since we entered the arena, I've been keeping a close eye on Wilhelm, because my premonition did not tell me exactly when he would try to kill me. I tried to not let it show, but I've seen him getting closer to me ever since I jumped on that marauder. The fact that I can't see him now can only mean one thing.

I quickly turn around, and I see Wilhelm standing right there, holding his orange hilted dagger with both hands, looking as if he'd been only seconds away from delivering a lethal blow. However, in this very moment, the man seems almost frozen. He keeps holding onto his dagger with both hands as if he were still about to attack me, but now that I'm facing him directly, all of his assassin instincts must be telling him to retreat, instead.

"Wilhelm?" I say.

Wilhelm says nothing. He keeps staring at me, quietly, as a trickle of sweat runs down his forehead.

"Wilhelm, are you alright, my friend?" I tell him, with a concerned tone, as I put my left hand on his shoulder. "You look rather tense!"

 Perfect! Two creatures are already down. Now let's see which monsters I should attack next.

Before I get to decide, I hear the sound of something dropping to the ground behind me, and I turn around to see what happened. From what I can gather, it would seem that Wilhelm is the one that's been knocked out, and my mage teammate is the one who hit him. Taking a closer look at the man on the ground, I see that there is an orange hilted dagger lying beside him, which he was most likely using to attack me, earlier.

I'm almost certain that the orange hilted dagger in question is a special kind of enchanted weapon, typically used by trained assassins, which helps conceal their auras. Does this mean that Wilhelm was an assassin? If so, then what reason would he have to target me, specifically?

There's no time to think about that now. I'll figure this out after the battle. Right now, I need to get back to the others.

"Why did you save me?" I ask the mage.

"I saved you," the mage says, "because I owed the silver haired princess for the advice that she gave me yesterday, about my device. With this, I'll consider my debt settled."

"I see," I say, simply.

"Do you have any idea why mister smiley over here would want you dead?" the mage says.

"I don't know," I say. "But I don't want to waste time figuring that out now, in the middle of the battle. We're done here. Let's go help the others."

"Idiot," I say to him, and then I begin heading towards the others.

"So, uh..." I hear the mage's voice coming from behind me, as he catches up to me. "Do you have any idea why mister smiley over there would want you dead?"

I completely forgot about this guy. I thought he already went to help the others, like the two thugs.

"No idea," I say. "I'll figure it out later. Right now, we need to focus on killing the creatures."

 By the time we reach the rest of our team, the two marauders they were fighting are already dead. It doesn't look like the second manticore had the guts to attack any of them while they were in such a large group, especially after what happened to its friend, earlier.  Leaving the manticore aside, we've still got two tramplers and two cobras left to deal with. We should start making plans right away, before the creatures take the initiative.

"Hey, Leila," I say. "Could you go and kill those tramplers over there? With your level of strength, I'm sure that you'll be able to cut through their tough hides without much trouble."

"By herself?" Bruce asks, in a loud voice. "Are you insane? Why would we not attack them in a group, like we did with these scorpions?"

"Because I want her to bait that manticore in the sky, while she's at it," I say. "Even if I were to go and attack them, the manticore wouldn't come after me, after what I did to its friend, and neither of you would have enough strength to be able to pass through the tramplers' armor."

"I'll do it," Leila writes. "You deal with the cobras in the meantime."

"Okay," I say. "You remember what the tramplers' weakness is, right?" I ask her.

"Yes, I remember," Leila writes, and then she turns away, heading for the tramplers.

"Have you seen her fight?" I ask him.

"Well... I did, but--" he starts to say, but I cut him off.

"Then you've got nothing to worry about," I say. "Those beasts will be nothing more than a warm-up exercise for her. Let's get going. I promised her that we'd deal with the giant cobras while she kills the other creatures."

"Fine," Bruce says. "We'll go kill the cobras, then."

 "I guess we could wait here for a while, to see if she needs backup," I say. "She's probably going to be pissed about it, though. She told us to go deal with the giant cobras in the meantime, not to stand here and do nothing."

"We'll get going as soon as she kills all of the creatures," Bruce says. "We'll have plenty of time to deal with the cobras before she gets back."

We stand there and watch Leila run towards the tramplers for the next few seconds. Seeing her out in the open, the tramplers have also decided to target her, and they are now charging towards her. Neither of them are giving signs that they'll be stopping anytime soon.

Now, if what I've read in all my notes is correct, the tramplers are much easier to intimidate than one would suspect. Tramplers are not used to being challenged on their own turf, so if you keep running towards them at full speed while they are charging at you, they will eventually stop charging, and back down. Leila knows of this weakness, and that's the reason why she's not stopping. Hopefully, everything will turn out okay.

After a few more seconds of running at each other, the two tramplers finally stop, about a dozen feet away from her, and they begin to swing their spiked mace tails towards her, in an attempt to intimidate her. 

 Perfect! This is the best scenario that Leila could be hoping for. A trampler's strength lies in its charges. A few tail swipes are only good to scare off dumb beasts. They're not going to inconvenience her. 

Leila jumps over one of the beasts and lands on its back, stabbing it in the back of its neck. Before the trampler even has time to fall to the ground, Leila already jumps off its back, in order to attack its companion. The second trampler barely has any time to react, before Leila gets below its head, running one of her knives straight through its lower jaw and all the way to its brain.

As soon as she gets away from the dying creature, the last remaining manticore makes a very fast dive towards her, in an attempt to surprise her. Leila feigns ignorance until the very last moment, and then she makes a powerful slash at the creature's chest, exactly when it reaches her. The manticore drops to the ground, and Leila finishes it off with one swift strike of her dagger.

Interesting. I've noticed this since we were fighting the marauder, but it looks like the mage is trying his hardest to avoid doing any actual fighting in this round.

 "Make sure you never stop moving sideways," I tell Bruce, as we approach the snakes. "The cobras can only shoot their acid in a straight line, and it takes them a few seconds to take aim, so as long as you don't give them the time they need, they won't be able to hit you."

"Understood," Bruce says.

"You take the one on the left," I tell him, and I make a rush towards the cobra on the right.

I bait the cobra by standing in one place for two seconds, and then I jump out of the way, making the creature miss its shot, and waste its acid. While the snake is busy gathering up more acid in its glands, I make a dash towards it, and I stab it in the head, killing it in one strike.

Leila is also done with the tramplers, and she's now heading our way. She appears to have killed the second manticore, as well.

This is it. It's over. The round is finally over. The crowds are going wild. They obviously weren't expecting us to make it. If I were Hadrik, I'd probably be making some sort of speech right now, but to be perfectly honest, all I want at this point is to go back to my division area, and get a little bit of rest, before the next round begins.

After a while, the announcer finally asks us to clear the fighting area, and we prepare to go back to our division room.

 "Wait, where's Wilhelm?" Bruce asks me, all of a sudden. "Wasn't he with you?

"Oh, he's over there," I say, as I point towards Wilhelm's unconscious body. "He said he was a little sleepy, and he decided to take a nap."

"Hold on, are you the one who knocked him out?" Bruce asks. "Did he try to attack you or something?"

"How did you guess?" I say.

"He was an assassin!" Bruce says. "I don't trust assassins. I've been watching my back for him ever since we entered the arena. Anyway, taking naps is all well and good, but the next division is waiting for us to leave the area. I'll go wake him up."

Bruce goes over to Wilhelm and he begins to slap his face, while he shouts at him.

"Wilhelm!" Bruce says. "Wilhelm, you no-good assassin, get up! Our first round is over. We need to clear the area."

 After a few more slaps to the face, Wilhelm opens his eyes, grabs Bruce's hand, and then grips it hard, while looking at him as if he'd want to murder him here and now.

"I'm awake," Wilhelm says, forcing a calm tone in his voice. "Let's get out of here."

It takes us about a minute, but we eventually get back to our division area, and once we re-enter our room, the iron gate closes itself behind us.

"I hope you won't try to assassinate anyone else on your way to the locker room, Wilbert," Bruce says. "If you get knocked out again, I'm not coming to wake you up."

"I paid you to get the job done, not to hear your excuses!" the ambassador shouts.

"You didn't pay me anything," Wilhelm says. "You just promised me that you'd get me out of this place, and that you'd make sure I don't get executed for killing a teammate, as long as I kept my end of the bargain. Well, I'm here to tell you that the deal's off. I'm not doing it anymore. It's too risky. He's already onto me. He told me that much. I don't feel like pissing off the stillwater any more than I already have."

"He's not a stillwater, you moron!" the ambassador says. "He's a lessathi!"

"You can't know that for sure," Wilhelm says.

"Of course I know for sure, you idiot!" the ambassador says. "Now get back there and do your job properly!"

"I'm not doing any job anymore," Wilhelm says. "Stop bothering me. I've already said what I had to say."

 "Sorry for the delay, everyone," the announcer says. "After checking to see which creatures we have left, it is my sad duty to inform you that our special stocks of creatures have been depleted, and that we will have to go back to our regular stock, from this fight onwards. I hope that this will not affect your enjoyment of the show too much. Now, with all this said and done, I would like to introduce to you the fifth division!"

Back to their regular stock, huh? I guess that those griffins and gargoyles that we killed in the underground caverns two days ago must have been their last reserves, then. It's a good thing that we decided to deal with them ahead of time, or that crazy arena owner might well have thrown those against us too.

When the next iron gate gets raised, Kate is the first one to step out into the fighting area. As she proceeds to the middle of the arena, the other members of her division also start to follow in her footsteps. Once I get a good look at all of Kate's teammates, I get the sudden realization that Kate is likely the most capable fighter in her division, even without her magic. Most of the others look severely out of shape, and some of them don't even have weapons. These clearly aren't the types of gladiators that came here willingly.

 As the unarmed fighters go to get their weapons of choice from the walls of the arena, the new creatures are slowly beginning to walk out of their den. 

The first ones to come out are pair of cave lions, which are basically larger versions of regular lions, but without the mane. Next, we see a few black wolves join the stage, which look similar to the ones we fought in the ogre shaman's illusion, except they're only about twice the size of regular wolves. As these creatures begin to slowly advance towards the middle of the arena, a few more black wolves and cave lions are making their appearance from behind the big iron gate. 

So this is what they call their regular stock. It's definitely a step down from the creatures we've been shown so far, but something tells me that the organizers wouldn't have been permitted to release so many of them at the same time if this were one of their regular shows. If Kate had a decent team backing her up, then I wouldn't be worried, but as it stands, she may well be forced to fight all these creatures alone. 

The first group of lions and wolves decides to take the initiative, and they begin to run together, towards the gladiators. When Kate's teammates see the beasts charge towards them, some of them start screaming and running away as fast as they can, while others charge right back at the creatures, in a desperate attempt to intimidate them.

 Kate is the only one who seems calm and collected, as her instincts take over again, just like in the ogre shaman's illusion, and she begins to move between one creature and another, slitting one's throat and then switching to the next target, without any wasted movements.

As the other beasts see the first group getting decimated, they decide that they should ignore the other gladiators for now, and focus all of their efforts on neutralizing Kate. They rush to the aid of their companions, and they quickly move to surround her, while she is busy fighting one of the wolves. Seeing that her escape route has been blocked, Kate tries to make her own way out, by going to attack one of the creatures in front of her. However, before she reaches her foe, one of the wolves behind her makes a dash for her and bites her left leg.

Kate sticks her knife through the wolf's head, but she lets her guard down, and one of the other wolves seizes the opportunity to pounce on her and pin her to the ground. She tries to stab the creature with her dagger, but the wolf uses its fangs to yank the weapon from her hand, and to throw it away, out of her reach.

"Kate!" I hear the voice of Rose, shouting from the audience, as I see her jump from her seat, with a look of desperation in her eyes.

What happened next left everyone in the crowd speechless, except for Arraka, whose voice was now the only one that could be heard echoing throughout the arena.

 "Damn it, she did it again!" Arraka says. "I can't believe this! Just when things were starting to get fun, she had to go and ruin everything again. Damn it all to hell!"

While Arraka's words probably made no sense for the people in the audience, the few of us who knew her understood the source of her frustration all too well. Almost immediately after Rose's shout, Kate suddenly disappeared from below the wolf, and she reappeared a few feet away from it, standing up, with the dagger back in her hand, and her attacker lying on the ground, in a pool of its own blood.

It didn't take me long to figure out that this was Rose's doing, who once again activated her powers by accident, freezing the time for everyone except her and Kate.

"Nobody panic!" the announcer says, all of a sudden, as he sees the scared reactions of the public. "I assure you that we'll get to the bottom of this as soon as the fight ends!"

Some of the people seem to be fidgeting nervously, while others are whispering amongst themselves with fear in their eyes. Although it's difficult to hear what exactly they are talking about, there seems to be one word in particular that all of those conversations have in common. It is the word 'banshee'.

 Kate manages to make her way out of the wolf encirclement, and she tries to retreat, in the hopes that some of her teammates will finally grow a backbone and help her flank the enemy that is now focusing on her, exclusively. Surprisingly, a few of the other gladiators get the hint, and they approach the creatures from behind, while they are distracted, managing to actually kill four of them, before the wolves and the lions are forced to change their tactics.

Now that Kate's teammates have finally joined the battle, and that the wolves and lions have scattered, it doesn't take the gladiators long until they hunt down their remaining enemies, and finish them all off.

Just when it was beginning to look as if all hope was lost, I see a knife made of ice slowly starting to come out of Kate's right palm, with its tip aimed forward. As soon as the knife gets fully created, Kate grabs it in her hand, and she uses it to stab the wolf through the side of its head, killing it immediately, and freeing herself from its clutches.

 The crowd is now watching in complete silence, as Kate gets up, and she begins to look for a way out of her predicament.

 "Uh..." the announcer says, looking a bit stressed out. "Now that the fight is over, I believe it is time to address all of your concerns about what happened earlier. Rest assured that the gross violation of our rules that has occurred during this battle has not gone unnoticed. We do not yet know why our magical detectors didn't detect any spells being cast, but after we'll conduct a thorough investigation and solve this mystery, I am almost certain that the banshee will be found guilty and sentenced to--"

"There will be no need for an investigation," we hear the voice of the arena's owner, as he makes his way on top of the elevated platform that the announcer is standing on. "First of all, there's a small correction that I'd like to make to our announcer's previous speech. The woman you see before you now is in fact not a banshee, but an actual mage, regardless of how hard some of you may be finding it to believe. I apologize for not making this clear from the very beginning, but I did not want to create any unnecessary tension if there was any chance that it could have been avoided."

The people in the crowd are not looking very convinced, and they are muttering between themselves, but none of them seem very keen on accusing the owner of lying.

 "Secondly," the owner says. "Our rules clearly state that in order for a magic spell to be considered illegal, it needs to set off our magical detectors. Obviously, this is more of a loophole than anything else, and I am not planning to let this go completely unpunished, however, I believe that ordering her execution in this case would be a bit too much, given the nature of her transgression. I will therefore agree to only turn her into an undesirable, as long as she agrees to tell us how she managed to bypass our magic detection system."

"...Very well," Kate says. "The reason why your detectors were not set off was because the spell used was a time freezing spell. I'm not an expert in these types of spells, but I'm assuming that since time got frozen in the entire world at the same time, the effect was too instantaneous for your devices to notice, and therefore they didn't get to trigger correctly."

"I see..." the announcer says. "Yes, that would make sense. I suppose that we'll need to work on the reaction time of our devices, then, if we are to ever detect these types of spells. Alright, then. In that case, as promised, you are free to return to your division area. However, it should go without saying that the next time you try to abuse our system like this, the consequences will be much more severe."

Obviously, this is more of a loophole than anything else, and I am not planning to let this go completely unpunished, however, I believe that ordering her execution in this case would be a bit too much, given the nature of her transgression. I will therefore agree to only turn her into an undesirable, as long as she agrees to tell us how she managed to bypass our magic detection system."

"...Very well," Kate says. "The reason why your detectors were not set off was because when I began to create my dagger of ice, I made sure to do it without letting any magical energy leave the confines of my aura. Given that your devices do not react to regular magical auras of mages while they are not casting spells, I figured that the magical particles need to actually leave a person's aura in order for them to be detected, so I decided to take the gamble, and to handle the creation of my dagger as close to my body as possible, in order to try and cheat the system."

"Very intriguing..." the owner says. "So your way of avoiding detection in fact required the use of a highly inefficient technique and of a ridiculously low amount of magical energy in order to succeed. That means I don't have to worry about anyone abusing this loophole in any serious way, anytime soon. Alright, then. In that case, as promised, you are free to return to your division area. However, it should go without saying that the next time you try to abuse our system like this, the consequences will be much more severe."

}
 "I understand," Kate says.

"Then prepare to clear the fighting area," the owner says. "The next fight will begin shortly."

As the owner turns to leave, Kate and the others also head towards their division area, while the warriors of the sixth division are preparing to enter the battlefield.

 "Sorry for the delay, everyone," the announcer says. "After checking to see which creatures we have left, it would appear that we are down to our last reserves after that last fight. If this division will manage to kill all the creatures as well, then we will be forced to go back to our regular stock of creatures for the divisions that follow. Now, with all this said and done, I would like to introduce to you the fifth division!"

When the next iron gate gets raised, Kate is the first one to step out into the fighting area. As she proceeds to the middle of the arena, the other members of her division also start to follow in her footsteps. Once I get a good look at all of Kate's teammates, I get the sudden realization that Kate is likely the most capable fighter in her division, even without her magic. Most of the others look severely out of shape, and some of them don't even have weapons. These clearly aren't the types of gladiators that came here willingly.

As the unarmed fighters go to get their weapons of choice from the walls of the arena, the new creatures are slowly beginning to walk out of their den. 

I recognize the creatures immediately as being the ones that I encountered two days ago in the underground caverns. Or some of them at least. The giant rats are missing. I guess they may have only been there as food for the griffins. Either way, this is looking pretty bad. I don't see Kate dealing with those monsters all by herself, and her teammates likely won't be much help. Will she be forced to use her magic? Things could get really ugly if she does. I don't even want to think about what would happen in that scenario. Maybe she can make it somehow. There's always hope...

 The harpies and the gargoyles are the first ones to make their way out of their den, and they immediately take to the air, studying their targets carefully. 

Harpies are hideous creatures that have the appearance of women with scales, wings and claws. They might look almost human, but in reality, they couldn't be more different. They are just about as intelligent as the lowliest of reptiles, and they're twice as vicious. The gargoyles, on the other hand, could accurately be described as thinner ogres, with wings and horns, and with strength that is comparable to that of the ogres as well. 

The dire wolves and the sabre-toothed tigers are next. They begin to walk slowly along the sides of the arena, trying to take measure of their opponents, and moving to surround them. 

The last ones to come out of the den are the griffins. They are creatures that have the bodies, tails and legs of lions, while their heads, wings, and talons are those of eagles. Like the harpies and the gargoyles before them, the first thing that the griffins do is to soar to the air, in order to get a better view of their targets.

Damn it! I knew I should have killed them in the underground caves, where they couldn't use their wings to fly away. This is definitely not going to be an easy fight for Kate, even if I did tell her all these monsters' weaknesses.

The sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves are the first to attack. When Kate's teammates see the beasts charge towards them, some of them start screaming and running away as fast as they can, while others charge right back at the creatures, in a desperate attempt to intimidate them.

 Kate is the only one who seems calm and collected, as her instincts take over again, just like in the ogre shaman's illusion, and she begins to move between one creature and another, slitting one's throat and then switching to the next target, without any wasted movements.

Even so, the enemies on the ground are by far the weakest of the group. The real threats are the gargoyles and the griffins. With the gargoyles' strength and the griffins' size, I can see very few ways in which Kate would be able to win a fight against them, especially while they've got the air advantage.

The griffins are now beginning to descend towards the gladiators, and they quickly make their first victim. One of the more frail looking gladiators in Kate's group gets grabbed in a griffin's claws, and the beast starts to peck at the man's chest with its beak, while he is still alive. Hearing the man's cries for help, and his terrible screams, the other men abandon all pretense of courage, and they run away as fast as they can, in all directions. One of the other griffins comes down, and it tries to attack Kate.

 Knowing the creature's behavior and attack patterns, Kate manages to step out of the way, and to slash at one of the creature's claws with her dagger, but she doesn't get to hurt the beast much before it flies back up, preparing itself for another dive.

"Things aren't looking very good for Kate," Leila writes to me. "In the worst case scenario, she might even be forced to use her ice magic. You know what that means, right?"

"Yeah," I say. "The punishment for using magic in the arena is death. In order to get out of here alive after that, she'd have to fight every single guard in the place, and to make this entire kingdom into her enemy."

"And what would you do if that happened?" Leila writes, looking at me with a very serious expression on her face. "Would you join her, and make the kingdom into your enemy as well? Would you be willing to forsake the Magium tournament and your ambitions, in order to take her side on the battlefield?"

 "If it comes down to it, then yes," I say. "And I think that my other friends would do so, as well. Probably."

"I see," Leila writes, with a slight smile on her face. "Then you will not be alone. When the inevitable happens, even if your friends don't join you, I am prepared to take Kate's side, no matter the cost."

"For now, let's hope that it won't be necessary," I say.

Not long after I finish my conversation with Leila, Kate gets chased by one of the griffins all the way to the wall that is next to our division's gate, and then she gets backed against said wall, with no place to escape. The griffin is descending towards her, slowly, while still maintaining a bit of altitude, and it is preparing to go for the finishing move. Kate appears to have lost her dagger, and there are no weapons in sight. I can already feel the air around us getting chillier. 

Is this it? Are we really going to do this? Damn it, I really was looking forward to winning this tournament and becoming a mage. Well, it was fun while it lasted, I guess...

}
 All of a sudden, one of the iron gates gets blown out of its hinges, and it drops to the ground, with a loud clang. Within seconds, Hadrik comes out of the gate, and he makes a dash towards the griffin attacking Kate, making a very high jump, and landing on the beast's back. The griffin doesn't appear to be too happy about what's happening, and it attempts to throw Hadrik off its back by doing sudden, violent movements, and by flapping its wings continuously.

"Hah!" Hadrik says, while he maintains his balance by holding onto the griffin's mane with one of his hands. "I always wanted to ride one of these!"

He then uses his other hand to wave towards the crowd, and he shouts as loud as he can: 

"Did you miss me?" 

The crowd explodes in an outburst of shouts and cheers, as the griffin keeps trying to shake Hadrik off its back with all its might. Seeing that the beast is not planning to settle down anytime soon, Hadrik grabs its head with both hands, and he snaps its neck with one quick movement of his arms.

"Down we go!" Hadrik says, as the griffin falls to the ground, along with him.

He then jumps off the creature, and he heads towards Kate.

"Are you alright, milady?" Hadrik says, with a bow.

 "Hadrik, what are you doing here?" Kate says, shocked. "You're not allowed to help me! They'll ban you from the tournament!"

"No, they won't," Hadrik says. "There was never any such rule. Didn't you pay attention to the announcements at the beginning?"

He then lowers his voice, so that the announcer and the spectators can't hear him.

"And besides," Hadrik says. "You were planning to use your ice magic just now, weren't you?"

"I..." Kate starts to say, but she hesitates to continue.

"No need to worry about it!" Hadrik says, as he pats her on the side of her arm. "All I wanted was to make sure that this magnificent arena event can continue to run its course until the very end!"

He then walks away from her, and he looks towards the monsters, trying to decide which one to attack first.

"Attention, participant Hadrik!" the announcer says, loudly. "You will leave the fighting area immediately or you will face the consequences, do you understand?"

"And by these consequences," Hadrik says. "do you mean to say that I'll be invited to join a bonus round at the end of the event?"

 "Well..." the announcer says. "Technically, yes. But you still can't interfere with the fights of other participants!"

"Why not?" Hadrik asks. "Is that one of the standard arena rules?"

"Well, no, but--"

"Then I don't see the problem!" Hadrik says.

"The problem is that you are ruining the show!" the announcer blurts out, all of a sudden.

"Oh, am I?" Hadrik says, with a grin.

He then turns towards the audience, and he raises his arms.

"What do you all think?" Hadrik shouts at the crowd. "Am I ruining the show?"

"Nooooo!" the spectators shout, in unison.

"Do you want me to stay?" Hadrik asks them.

In answer to Hadrik's question, the crowd cheers louder than ever before.

"Well, I guess that's settled, then!" Hadrik says, to the announcer, and then he rushes towards a griffin that's flying at a lower altitude.

 He jumps on the creature's back, just like he did with the one before, and he holds onto its mane firmly, making sure to not get thrown down. The griffin tries to shake him off, just like the one before, but this time, the beast stops moving after a while, looking almost as if it were accepting Hadrik as its new master. 

"I see you're smarter than the other one!" Hadrik says. "Alright then, let's see how well you cooperate. First, we'll go over there. If we're really doing this, then I'm going to need a weapon with long reach, before anything else."

To everyone's shock, the griffin obediently follows Hadrik's order, and it leads him all the way to the side of the arena, so that he can take a halberd off the wall. He then pulls on the griffin's mane, in order to show it the direction that he wants to go in, and the creature flies him all the way to one of the gargoyles, up in the sky. Hadrik cuts the head off the gargoyle's shoulders in one single movement of his halberd, and then he orders the griffin to move on to the next target. In the next few minutes, the dwarf travels from one monster to another, on the back of his trusty griffin, and he kills all of them in quick succession, without so much as breaking a sweat. 

As the two of them finally descend to the ground, Hadrik sees that Kate had also taken care of the sabre-toothed tigers and the dire wolves on the ground in the meantime. This leaves Hadrik's griffin as the last remaining monster on the battlefield. As the crowds keep cheering, Hadrik dismounts the griffin, and he raises his arms in the air, to silence the crowd.

 "All of the other beasts are dead," Hadrik says, to the announcer. "This last one has already surrendered itself to me. I request permission to spare its life, as a token of gratitude for its services! What say you?"

"Preposterous!" the announcer shouts. "Do you seriously expect--"

"Permission granted," we hear the arena owner's voice, as he makes his way on top of the elevated platform that the announcer is standing on. "If that is your wish, then we will take this griffin back to its cell, we will feed it, and then we will release it back into the wild. There will likely never be an event like this again in my lifetime, so there would be no reason to keep this beast shackled any longer."

"Much obliged!" Hadrik says.

"I hope," the arena owner says, "that you will continue to provide us with the same level of quality entertainment in the fourth round as in the previous two fights."

"I will do my best!" Hadrik says.

"Oh," the owner says. "And I will be expecting the same from you, Miss Kate, since you will also be joining your friend in the extra round as an undesirable. Given that his transgression of the rules was done specifically to save your life, I trust that there will be no objections?"

 "No..." Kate says. "I have no objections."

"Very well!" the owner says. "Now, if you all don't mind, I would appreciate it if you cleared the fighting area as soon as possible. The next division's fight is about to start."

As the owner turns to leave, Kate and the others also head towards their respective division areas, while the warriors of the sixth division are preparing to enter the battlefield.

 The next few battles weren't really anything special. A few gladiators died here and there, but most of them survived, and the number of creatures that were being thrown at them in each fight became gradually smaller, as the arena's stocks of regular creatures began to slowly deplete as well.

As I keep watching the fights, I'm starting to get a feeling of relief, because most, if not all of the warriors that we've seen since Kate's battle are nowhere near strong enough to deal with monsters such as manticores or desert marauders.  This means that defeating them should be a piece of cake. Maybe this arena wasn't so scary after all!

"Don't get too relaxed," Leila writes, as she sees the expression on my face, while we watch the final battle of the round. "We still have no idea how we're going to defeat the troll, and to be frank, I think he's going to be much more dangerous than the monsters we've fought so far."

"Yes, but you are forgetting something!" I tell Leila. "We are the fourth division. This means that the troll will have to go through Hadrik and Daren before he reaches us. Regeneration or no, I honestly couldn't even imagine Hadrik losing a duel against him, after the way he's fought in this first round. The way I see it, they may as well be crowning us victors of this arena event right now, because there really isn't much of a point in dragging this any long--"

"Attention, all gladiators!" the announcer says in a very loud voice, all of a sudden. 

While I was talking with Leila, it seems that the final battle had already ended, and the warriors were now returning to their division area.

 "There has been a slight change in our fight schedule for the second round!" the announcer continues. "Unlike the first round, where the divisions have been fighting in the order of their division numbers, in this second round there will be one exception to the rule. By special request of our esteemed arena owner, mister Venard, the first division to fight Velgos in the second round will be none other than division number four! Gladiators of the fourth division, please make sure that you are ready! The fight will begin in the next few minutes."

"Humans!" we hear the voice of Velgos the troll, shouting from the other end of the arena, as soon as the announcer stops talking. "Your time is up! There is nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. All that awaits you is death. Blame your fate for having been unlucky enough to cross paths with Velgos the mercenary!"

The crowds are going wild again, just like they did after Hadrik's first fight, and they're chanting the troll's name loudly over and over. 

"Velgos! Velgos! Velgos!" they all keep chanting, as the troll waves to the crowd and makes intimidating gestures towards us, every once in a while.

"Huh," I tell Leila. "Well... damn."
