 As Gontrok gets closer and closer, we all eventually stop talking while a feeling of tenseness and uncertainty gradually begins to fill the air around us. Hadrik is now putting some distance between him and us, in order to make sure that we won't be caught in the crossfire when the two shapeshifted giants begin exchanging blows. The next twenty seconds of waiting feel almost like an eternity. 

When Gontrok finally enters our line of sight, Hadrik plants his feet into the ground and he puts his guard up, bracing himself for impact. Without showing any signs of slowing down, Gontrok keeps charging towards us, lining himself up with Hadrik until he arrives about two dozen feet in front of him. He then suddenly accelerates, travelling the remaining distance between the two of them in the blink of an eye, while readying his fist to strike as hard as he can.

Hadrik blocks the punch with both his forearms, but the impact of the hit is still strong enough to send him flying a few feet backwards. When he sees his enemy successfully landing on his feet after the first attack, Gontrok stops to give Hadrik a malicious grin before he begins to talk.

"I've been looking forward to this!" Gontrok says. "I hope you're ready for our rematch, Hadrik."

 "More ready than you think," Hadrik says.

"Well, in that case, let's see what you-- hold on a minute, there... I recognize that goblin!" Gontrok says, as he points towards Kelrim. "I've seen him with the rebels. And if you people are travelling with him now, then that means..."

As Gontrok figures out what's going on, his face gradually lights up with joy.

"Hah! I knew it!" he says in a loud voice, making sure that we can all hear him properly. "You were hiding under the city this whole time, weren't you? That's why we couldn't find you! You were being sheltered by the so-called 'king of the underground' and his merry men. I’ve been telling the real king for a long time that these underground dwellers were traitors and needed to be eliminated, but the captain would always find a way to defend his old disciple and to claim that this underground society somehow didn't pose a threat to us. Oh, I can't wait to see how he'll defend them now!"

 "Actually, the king of the underground is not our friend. He even attacked us this morning!" I say loudly.

"So he finally came to his senses when he realized who you were?" Gontrok says. "Well, that still doesn't make up for the fact that he's been harboring criminals. First the rebels and now you. It's clear that this king of the underground is working against the best interests of Ollendor, and I'll make sure that he gets punished for it."

"Hey, Gontrok," Hadrik says. "Do you really think you have the luxury to talk to other people after you challenged me to a battle?"

"Be serious," Gontrok says. "You know full well that I'm only toying with you. I know your fighting style by heart already. At this point there is nothing you can do that would surprise me in the slight--"

Before Gontrok gets to finish what he was saying, Hadrik makes a quick jump forward, landing exactly in front of his enemy. Then, in the span of one second, Hadrik enlarges himself to the size of a normal human and he kicks Gontrok in the face, sending him crashing into a nearby wall.

 "Heh..." Gontrok says, as he now gets up, looking at the human-sized Hadrik in front of him while wiping the blood from his upper lip. "You've been shapeshifting as a dwarf for so long that I almost forgot these were your real body proportions, Hadrik. This was a good surprise attack, I'll grant you that. So, what are you planning to do now? Fight me in your new human-sized form and hope that it will somehow be enough to throw me off my game?"

"No," Hadrik says. "What I'm planning to do is this."

He then rushes towards Gontrok again and he feigns a punch to his face, but instead of going through with it, he immediately shapeshifts back into a dwarf and he punches him in his stomach instead. As Gontrok jumps sideways to put some distance between the two of them, Hadrik follows him and he changes his size to that of a human again. This time, Gontrok was expecting it and he tries to hit him in the bridge of his nose, but what he gets to punch is empty air, because Hadrik once again switches back to his dwarf form and he kicks his opponent in the shin.

 For the next half of a minute or so, Hadrik keeps changing his size constantly while fighting, in order to make sure that his enemy is as confused as possible. As expected, Gontrok looks like he's having a really hard time adapting to such an unusual fighting style, and for the first time since we've met him, it seems like he is now fully on the defensive, without even attempting to land a hit anymore. After sustaining a few more injuries, Gontrok realizes that he needs to regain control of the battle, so he shapeshifts only his back into that of an archer porcupine, and then he turns around, sending a few of the quills flying towards Hadrik at a much higher speed than what I've witnessed from the porcupines in the arena of Thilias.

As Hadrik dodges the first few projectiles, Gontrok sends more of them his way, forcing his enemy to gradually back away from him, in order to give himself a bit of time to catch his breath.

 "They only offered us temporary shelter. There's no need to get them involved in this," I say loudly.

"Temporary or not, they knew very well what they were doing," Gontrok says. "The announcement about the king's brother's death was made yesterday in the evening. The people from the underground had all the time they needed to chain you up and send you to us if that's what they wanted to do. Since you're roaming around freely with one of their own, it's clear that handing you over to the king was never their intention."

"Hey, Gontrok," Hadrik says. "Do you really think you have the luxury to talk to other people after you challenged me to a battle?"

"Be serious," Gontrok says. "You know full well that I'm only toying with you. I know your fighting style by heart already. At this point there is nothing you can do that would surprise me in the slight--"

 "Hey, if you want to attack the king of the underground, it's fine by me. I never liked the guy," I say loudly.

"Those are some ungrateful words you are spouting towards your life's savior," Gontrok says to me, in disgust. "Do you have no honor?"

"Guess not," I say, as I shrug.

 "Looks like you're finally remembering what it means to be a warrior, old friend," Gontrok says, while breathing heavily. "That's good. I was beginning to worry that all those years you've spent masquerading as a dwarf had turned you soft. Now I can tell your parents that their pathetic son has at least not completely lost his honor. Not that they would care much, of course. Most of the times when I talk to them about you, they like to pretend that you don't even exist."

"Shut your mouth and continue the fight, Gontrok--" Hadrik says, but he is interrupted.

"Was it worth it, Hadrik?!" Gontrok shouts loudly, in order to drown out Hadrik's voice. "Was it worth it to leave your homeland behind, along with all of your friends and family, just because of what happened to an insignificant dwarf village?"

"Dwarf," Arraka says. "I swear... if I see you losing your cool again over this..."

"I get it," Hadrik tells her in a calm tone, even though it's clear that he is barely able to contain his anger.

 "What did you even hope to accomplish by travelling through the dwarven lands in the shape of a dwarf?" Gontrok asks Hadrik, while ignoring Arraka. "Were you trying to atone for your sins? Did you think that you'd somehow make things right after killing all those dwarf women and children by going to put flowers on their graves or something? Face it, Hadrik, you are a murderer, like the rest of us. The only difference between you and me is that I am not an honorless dog like you, and I can live with killing a few civilians during a war without turning into a complete coward."

"Dwarf," Arraka says. "If you let him get under your skin again, I swear I am going to rip out your spine and--"

"I said I get it!" Hadrik shouts loudly, as he rushes furiously towards Gontrok.

When Gontrok tries to block his opponent's first hit, Hadrik shapeshifts himself into the size of a leprechaun, sliding between Gontrok's legs and arriving behind him. Then, he almost instantly turns back into human size, grabbing Gontrok's head from behind and pushing it hard into the ground. As he is now holding Gontrok's head against the pavement with his left hand, Hadrik goes for the finishing blow, attempting to punch him as hard as he can with his right fist in the back of the head.

 What happens instead is that Hadrik's fist hits a small, semi-transparent barrier right above Gontrok's head, which appeared seemingly out of nowhere. Gontrok takes advantage of the confusion Hadrik is in to escape his grasp and to jump backwards, and once he is safely out of his old friend's reach he begins staring at a narrow alleyway to our right, with a reproachful look in his eyes.

"Your help was unnecessary, captain," Gontrok says.

"Was it, really?" we hear the voice of the captain of the guards, as he is now slowly revealing himself. "It most certainly didn't look like you had things under control from where I was standing, recruit."

"Have you been watching us this whole time?" Gontrok says.

"I've been watching enough of this fight to know that you're out of your league, Gontrok," the captain says. "I did not want to interrupt you at first, because you tend to react badly when people interfere with your duels, but after seeing your abysmal performance just now, I've concluded that I've already let you waste enough of my time as it is. Get out of the way, Gontrok. The rest of us will take it from here."

As Gontrok looks like he is simply boiling with rage, the other royal guards are now approaching us one by one, from every direction.

 "Hey, Gontrok, are you going to just let him insult you like that?"

"Shut up!" Gontrok tells me, furiously. "I don't need you to tell me what to do. The captain can go jump off a cliff for all I care. I am not stepping away from this fight."

"What you plan to do is irrelevant," the captain says. "We're going to finish them all off before you even get the chance to lay another finger on them. Observe."

Right after the captain is done talking, an immense pressure pushes us all to the ground, immobilizing us in an instant. As I'm hearing some noises above me, I struggle to raise my head so I can see what's going on. Apparently, in the short time when I wasn't looking, the sky had been filled with large rocks that are floating in the air, just waiting to be dropped on us.

A few seconds later, the earth elementalist who is controlling the rocks decides to throw some of them into us, while we are still being pinned against the ground. Before they reach us, Daren raises his sword in the air and moves it to the side, which immediately breaks the effect of the captain's aura manipulation technique.

 With no time to waste, Kate conjures a floating shield made of reinforced ice over our heads, while Hadrik makes a high jump and he smashes the biggest of the boulders heading towards us into small pieces. Some of the rocks break through Kate's ice, but we manage to move away from them and to avoid getting hit.

"Hahaha!" Gontrok laughs. "What's the matter, captain? I thought you had everything under control. Do you need a hand, perhaps?"

"Keep quiet, you imbecile," the captain says. "They would have all been dead by now if you had followed my original plan."

"You can take your original plan and shove it up your arse," Gontrok says. "I am nobody's lapdog, and especially not yours."

 "Hey, Illuna," I whisper. "If I can keep them talking for a while longer, do you think you could conjure those huge flying water serpents from yesterday again?"

"I've been preparing that spell ever since the guards began heading towards us," Illuna says in a low voice. "I could cast it now, but most of these mages would be strong enough to destroy the serpents without much effort. If my spell is to have any effect on them, they'd need to get immobilized first, somehow."

"I could try and freeze all the enemies around us, but you'd have to huddle up closer so that I don't freeze any of you by accident," Kate whispers.

"Pssst, Hadrik!" I say in a low voice. "Hadrik, can you hear me?... Damn it, he's not looking at us!"

"You won't be breaking anyone's kneecaps, Gontrok," the captain says. "I already told you. Your role in this fight is over. We will dispose of these criminals in a matter of seconds, so you can just stand there and watch."

 "Hey, where's Loyrang, anyway?" Gontrok says. "Shouldn't he have been here by now?"

"He received the same message we all did," says a royal guard with pointy ears and short blond hair, who appears to be an elf. "If he's not here, then he's disobeying a direct order from the king."

"Didn't he say he needed to go to a herbalist shop?" Gontrok says. "This area is full of them. Maybe he's in one of the shops and he'll get here as soon as he's finished."

"Stop lying to yourself, Gontrok," the elf says. "It's clear that your friend betrayed us."

"What did you just say to me?..." Gontrok says, as he gives the elf a menacing look.

"Hadrik!" Kate says as loud as she can while still keeping her voice low enough to not draw attention to herself from the others.

As Hadrik finally turns to look in our direction, Kate signals him to come closer to us through a hand gesture, and when he understands what she means, the dwarf begins to approach us with small steps, in order to not distract our enemies while they are still arguing.

 "What the hell is going on here?!" we suddenly hear the voice of the Thilias ambassador, coming from somewhere behind the captain, in the same alleyway. "What are you idiots doing?"

"Ambassador, I told you to wait in one of the empty houses, where it was safe, until--" the captain says.

"Silence, you cretin!"  the ambassador shouts angrily, as we now see him approaching the captain of the guards. "Do you not see the earl's murderers right in front of you? Why aren't you killing them?! Stop talking and kill them now! Do you hear me?! Kill them now!!!"

As soon as Hadrik gets close enough to our group, Kate sends a quick wave of freezing magic all around us, targeting all of the enemies in our vicinity. The royal guard with the pointy ears manages to conjure a wind barrier in time, defending himself from the attack. The captain hardens his aura in the form of a semi-transparent shield, which keeps both him and the ambassador from freezing. Two of the other guards are not fast enough to react, however.

The wave of freezing magic catches Gontrok and a royal guard wearing a red cape and a hood completely by surprise, turning them both into statues of ice. Illuna does not miss this opportunity and she immediately conjures three huge flying water serpents, just like yesterday, each of them going after their own target.

 Just when it seems like the giant is about to be engulfed by the water, he somehow cracks open the ice he was encased in, and he jumps out of the way in the nick of time. The guard with the red cape, on the other hand, is not so lucky. The serpent swallows him whole, and then it continues to fly away, carrying him far from the battlefield.

Meanwhile, the other two serpents are not doing so well. The elf air elementalist appears to have created a small but very powerful tornado in front of him, which is making short work of Illuna's water construct, despite its large size. In a different part of the battlefield, it looks like the captain of the guards transformed a part of his aura into some kind of invisible sword, because he is acting as if he were holding a weapon by the hilt with both hands, while cutting the water serpent in half.

"I won't," I say.

"Kate, if we want to target the ambassador properly, we'll need to cut off his escape route first," Illuna says.

"I'm on it," Kate says, and then she creates a large wall of reinforced ice behind the ambassador, closing off the alley that he came from.

Illuna then makes two long water whips and she throws them both on the ground. In a matter of seconds, the two whips gain a life of their own and they turn into cobras made of water, slithering rapidly towards the ambassador. Meanwhile, a long spike made of ice appears from the ground behind the ambassador, preparing to impale him.

Having defeated Illuna's flying water serpent, the captain quickly makes a semi-transparent defensive barrier around him and the ambassador, which defends them from Kate's ice attacks and Illuna's water cobras for the time being.

"What are you all looking at?!" the captain shouts at the other guards, as Flower is now also starting to shoot some fire arrows towards the ambassador of Ollendor. "Help me defend the ambassador! Attack these fools with everything you've got!"

"Yes, defend me!" the ambassador says in a loud but slightly trembling voice, as he is beginning to panic a little. "Defend me at all costs!"

 Right after the captain stops talking, Hadrik attacks Gontrok again, not wanting to give him the time to decide if he wants to listen to his captain's orders or not. As the two of them fight, it is becoming apparent that Gontrok has gotten a little more used to Hadrik's new fighting style, because even though he is still on the defensive, he does not seem to be as overwhelmed as before.

"Melindra, could you give me the flight spell--" I say, but before I finish, I can already feel the air currents moving around me.

"Thanks!" I say, and I raise my arms so that I can take off from the ground.

"Hey, morons!" Arraka says, in a voice low enough that the royal guards can't hear her. "Remember how you told me to let you know when the guy with the hidden aura would be close enough to attack? Well, he just arrived, and he's hiding in that empty house over there."

She then draws a human-shaped figure made out of blue light on the wall of a building, with some blue words written on top, saying: "I'm hiding here".  A mere few seconds later, Kate sends a dozen icicles towards the figure on the wall, aiming for every vital point there is. As the magically sharpened icicles easily pass through the stone building's exterior, we hear a very short scream of pain coming from the other side, which is all that our black-robed enemy has time to do before dying and then falling on the ground.

"Daren, Leila, let's try fighting the air elementalist together," I say, as I am floating slightly above the ground. "I'll charge at him first, to create an opening, and then you guys can go in for the kill."

When I get closer to him, I suddenly feel myself starting to spin in place in mid-air, faster and faster. I try to free myself, but it's no use. The whirlwind that is spinning me is simply too strong.

"At long last, somebody was kind enough to fall into one of my traps," the elf says, as he sends a wind blade my way. "I've been waiting here for ages!"

When I get closer to him, I can't help but notice that my air currents are moving a little unusually. With the wind blowing in my face while I'm flying it was a little difficult to tell the difference, but now that I've stopped, it most definitely feels like the currents around me are not moving in their usual way. As if they were... reacting to something.

When I extend one of my arms forward, I realize that the air in front of me is also not moving the way it should. Is it also reacting to Melindra's air currents? Then this can only mean--

"Leila, stop moving now!" I say, and Leila immediately halts her advance. "Daren, there's a wind trap in front of me! I think there may be more of them all around this area. Try swinging your sword around as you move, and see if you can disarm them or absorb the air element!"

Just as I am done talking, the elf launches a wind blade towards me, which is much too fast for me to be able to react to. The wind blade cuts me cleanly in half in less than a second, and it kills me shortly afterwards.

 While I am busy evading the semi-transparent blades of air, I suddenly hear the Overseer's voice coming from behind me.

"Warning! Warning!" says the green-eyed drone that was apparently still following me. "A non-combat unit is being under attack. Requesting backup immediately."

"What the hell?..." the air elementalist elf says, as he temporarily stops sending wind blades my way to look at the sky.

Several red-eyed drones are now rapidly descending towards us, and their target seems to be the air elementalist in front of me.

"Get away from me, you idiotic machines!" the elf says, as he sends some of his blades of air at the metal balls, but his attacks are easily dodged by them.

"Now's our chance," I say to Leila and Daren. "Let's rush him while he's being distracted!"

Right after saying this, a large hydra with six heads, made entirely of wind appears in front of us, blocking our way towards the air elementalist. Even though the monster is technically made of air, we can still tell that it's supposed to be a hydra because of the way the sun's light is reflecting from its surface. Seeing the huge creature in front of us, Daren and I both stop but Leila just keeps sprinting ahead, straight through the hydra while heading directly for the elf. 

 Being too focused on the drones to notice her, the air elementalist only realizes that he was being flanked when he gets stabbed with one of Leila's daggers through the back of the throat. Once Leila removes her dagger, the elf puts his hand on his neck, trying to stop the flow of blood but there's just too much of it pouring out for him to be able to do anything. Not long afterwards, the elf loses the strength from his legs and he falls flat on the ground, with nothing left to do but to slowly bleed out and die.

"How did you know that the hydra wouldn't attack you?" Daren asks Leila, as the creature made of air is now fading away.

"I didn't," Leila writes, as she is now coming back, "but the elf wasn't paying attention to us when the hydra appeared, and he didn't do any gestures that would make me believe he was the one who cast that spell, so I figured that the chances were high for this to be simply an illusion made by some other mage to scare us away."

"Nicely done!" I say. "And that was a nice assist from you too, Overseer. I didn't think keeping you around would actually turn out to be helpful."

"Does this mean you are now satisfied with the quality of your interactions with the Overseer protocol?" the Overseer says.

 "What?" I say. "Oh, uhm... sure, I guess..."

"Your previously given rating of zero has been updated to a rating of five out of five," the Overseer says. "Thank you for your input. The answer to the second question of the survey will no longer be necessary. Have a nice day!"

Having said this, the green-eyed drone finally decides to stop following me, and it proceeds to fly up into the sky, along with all of the red-eyed drones that came to its defense.

As I am standing there, looking at the metal balls flying away from me, I notice Loyrang with the corner of my eye, who seems rather bored of this whole situation and who has given no sign of wanting to attack us so far.

"Hey, so, uhm... here's a quick question..." I tell him. "Are you going to be a part of this fight or not?"

"Only if you force me to," Loyrang answers me.

"Fair enough," I say.

As we are trying to decide what to do next, the man in black robes that ambushed us yesterday suddenly teleports behind Kate, attempting to stab her with a knife.

 We do what Daren says and then he charges at the hydra, swinging his sword at it as hard as he can. Unfortunately, instead of absorbing anything, the sword simply passes through the semi-transparent hydra as if he were just using some normal weapon to cut through non-magical air.

"Damn, it's not working!" Daren says. "Get back from the hydra. Get back now!"

Daren jumps away as two of the hydra's heads lunge towards him and we all distance ourselves from the large creature without being harmed. It appears that the hydra is not planning to follow us, but it also won't let us get anywhere near the elf. Now that the elf is safe from our attacks, he decides to resume his previous tactic of throwing wind blades at us until he hits someone. While I am dodging again in mid-air, Daren calls out to me from below.

"Barry, Leila, come hide inside my barrier for now," he says. "There's no use tiring yourselves out like that until we make another plan of attack."

Leila and I both graciously accept Daren's offer and after evading a few more of the elf's attacks, we manage to move inside Daren's barrier safely.

 

While I am busy evading the semi-transparent blades of air, I suddenly hear a man's voice echoing around us, although it is hard to pinpoint the exact location it's coming from.

The language the voice is speaking in appears to be some elven dialect, because the elf air elementalist responds to it and soon afterwards he casts a powerful gust of wind that pushes us all away from him.

The elf then begins chanting something, while he moves his hands around in circles. A few seconds after the chant, a large hydra with six heads, made entirely of wind appears in front of us, blocking our way towards the air elementalist. Even though the monster is technically made of air, we can still tell that it's supposed to be a hydra because of the way the sun's light is reflecting from its surface.

"Everyone step back!" Daren says. "I'll try to see if I can absorb the air element out of the hydra with my sword."

 "Actually, that won't be necessary," I say. "I understood what they were talking about just now, and that hydra is just an illusion. We can simply go through it and nothing will happen to us."

"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Daren says.

"Yes, I guarantee it," I say. "If it were some bluff, they would have talked in the Common language, not in an obscure dialect that we'd normally have no way of understanding."

"Well, let's see if you're right, then," Daren says, as he blocks a wind blade with his shield and then charges straight through the hydra, along with Leila.

I fly through the illusion as well, and as we get close to the air elementalist, we begin to flank him. The elf tries to push us away from him again, but Leila manages to sneak up behind him and she runs a dagger through the back of his throat before he has the time to react. Once Leila removes her dagger, the elf puts his hand on his neck, trying to stop the flow of blood but there's just too much of it pouring out for him to be able to do anything.

While I am busy evading the semi-transparent blades of air, I suddenly hear a man's voice echoing around us, although it is hard to pinpoint the exact location it's coming from.

I immediately recognize the language spoken as being an older elven dialect that is still being used in the Eastern Continent. 

"Try to pretend that you're casting a powerful spell so I can make an illusion of an air hydra in front of you," the voice says.

"Okay, but let me push them away from me first," the air elementalist elf says in the same language, and then he casts a powerful gust of wind that pushes us all away from his location, like he said.

The elf then begins chanting something, while he moves his hands around in circles. A few seconds after the chant, a large hydra with six heads, made entirely of wind appears in front of us, blocking our way towards the air elementalist.

"The king will hear about this!" the elf says. "Mark my words!"

"Okay," Loyrang says simply.

The elf keeps attacking us for a while, but thankfully Daren's barrier seems to be holding up nicely, and it's not in any danger of failing.

 Maybe with a little luck, I can bribe or threaten the guy to move the rocks away from the battlefield. If worse comes to worst, I guess I could shout a warning to everyone below as soon as the earth elementalist is dead. That should normally give my friends enough time to defend themselves from the falling rocks in one way or another.

While I am navigating carefully between the boulders, I can't help but notice that the Overseer's green-eyed drone is still following closely behind me. Does he seriously still think I'm going to answer that survey or is he just messing with me?... I guess it doesn't really matter either way. At this rate, that drone is probably just going to crash into one of these rocks and then I won't have to worry about it anymore.

}
 I fly up in the sky, heading towards the hundreds of boulders that are just floating in the air, waiting to drop on us. 

Am I just imagining things, or are there more rocks now than there were before? No, I'm definitely not imagining it. The number of rocks has almost doubled since the last time I looked at the sky. Does this mean that this bastard has just been making boulders all this time while the rest of us were busy fighting below? I suppose that would explain why he hasn't bothered to attack us again after that one time at the beginning. He must still be preparing his ammunition.

When I get close to the rocks, I slow down my speed and I fly into their midst, in the hopes that I will find the earth elementalist who made them somewhere nearby.

Oh, boy... there sure are a lot of boulders here, aren't there? I wonder what would happen if I were to kill the earth elementalist who created them while the boulders are still floating in the sky. They probably won't be kind enough to just remain in the air, will they?... Then again, if I don't deal with the elementalist, he'll just keep making more of these rocks, and then he'll send them towards the ground at an even higher speed than if they were to simply fall.

After flying around aimlessly for a few more seconds, I realize that I'm not making any progress like this, so I decide to close my eyes and to focus only on finding the mage's aura.

I float there, in the middle of all the rocks for about ten seconds, trying in vain to detect any aura that might seem like it belongs to a person. I keep trying and trying but his aura is just too well hidden. It's as if he weren't even here.

I don't get to think about this for much longer, because two large boulders approach me at great speed while I'm not paying attention, coming from two opposite sides, and they smash my head into pieces before I even get to understand what's going on.

 Wait a minute... The earth elementalist only knows where to send his boulders because he can detect me by using his magical sense, right? So, what would happen if I were to try hiding my aura like he is doing? I think I have enough levels in my Aura Concealment stat to give this a shot.

As I keep dodging rocks in mid-air, I attempt to hide my aura, using the technique I've learned from Illuna. Almost immediately afterwards, the boulders stop moving completely, and they're now floating in place just like at the beginning.

It's working! He doesn't know where I am anymore, but I still know where he is. Now, the question is... should I use this opportunity to go back down and see what the others are doing? Or should I keep going after the earth elementalist?

 Throughout all the chaos, one of the boulders accidentally brushes off against the drone that is still following me. This causes the metal ball to start talking in a loud voice, even though it doesn't seem to be addressing anyone in particular.

"Warning! Warning!" says the green-eyed drone. "A non-combat unit is being under attack. Requesting backup immed--"

The drone does not get to finish calling for its friends, because another rock hits it by mistake, this time destroying it completely and sending it crashing to the ground. Meanwhile, the rest of the boulders are still chasing me around, as I am struggling to keep up with their speed. 

With the sheer number of rocks that are attempting to smash my head in right now, I am honestly required to use all of the flying expertise that I've accumulated so far to be able to avoid them. The problem is that it's now impossible for me to get any closer to the earth elementalist, because he keeps moving away from me and I'm already too busy just trying to stay alive.

Hmm... He's clearly hiding his aura, but I can sense it if I concentrate on it really hard. What I'm not getting is why I can't see him. I'm looking in his direction right now, but all I'm seeing is a huge rock. Is he hiding behind the rock?... No! Within! He is hiding within the rock. That's got to be it!

As I am having my revelation, two large rocks are coming at me from opposite sides, at high speed, trying to crush my head between them. I easily dodge them and then I head towards the big boulder in which the elementalist is currently hiding. Seeing that I'm flying straight for him with my dagger ready, the elementalist immediately moves his big boulder out of the way, and then all of a sudden half of the rocks that were immobile only a second ago are flying out of the elementalist's path to make way for him to pass, while the other half are trying to kill me.

 With the sheer number of rocks that are attempting to smash my head in right now, I am honestly required to use all of the flying expertise that I've accumulated so far to be able to avoid them. The problem is that it's now impossible for me to get any closer to the earth elementalist, because he keeps moving away from me and I'm already too busy just trying to stay alive.

 Wait a minute... The earth elementalist only knows where to send his boulders because he can detect me by using his magical sense, right? So, what would happen if I were to try hiding my aura again like I was doing before the battle began? I think my Aura Concealment level should be high enough for this to be worth a shot.

As I keep dodging rocks in mid-air, I attempt to hide my aura, using the technique I've learned from Illuna. Almost immediately afterwards, the boulders stop moving completely, and they're now floating in place just like at the beginning.

It's working! He doesn't know where I am anymore, but I still know where he is. Now, the question is... should I use this opportunity to go back down and see what the others are doing? Or should I keep going after the earth elementalist?

 Chasing down the elementalist is probably going to take a while. I should check and see how everyone else is doing first. I don't have a lot of visibility with all these big rocks around me, so I have no idea what's been happening down there this whole time.

I fly out of the boulder zone and then I take a quick look at the ground to see if anyone's in trouble. Hadrik is still fighting Gontrok, apparently, but he's doing fine on his own. Daren and Leila are busy with the air elementalist elf, who looks like he conjured some sort of hydra made out of wind that is forcing them to hold a defensive position inside Daren's magical barrier for now.

Kate and Flower are still firing projectiles at the captain and the ambassador, but they're also fighting the guy in black robes who ambushed us yesterday at the same time. Illuna and Kate are both trying to hit him, but he keeps teleporting around and sending flying swords at them so they are having a hard time dealing with him. I think they could use some help.

I decide to fly a little closer to the ground, in the hopes that I can take the black-robed guy by surprise.

My superhuman strength allows me to cut through the rock's surface in a single movement, and I can tell that the blade's length helped as well. Inside the floating bottom half of the rock, I can now see a man in his early fifties with a bushy mustache who is currently crawled up in a fetal position, probably because he avoided my powerful slash from earlier.

I doubt I'm going to get a better chance than this to deal with the earth elementalist, so I should probably keep chasing him. I'm sure that my friends will be fine without me for a while longer.

I use my magical sense to detect the mage's location again, and then I head in his direction while making sure to mask my own aura and to always keep a few boulders between me and him just in case. I eventually manage to get close enough to the rock he is hiding in without alerting him, but I'm still going to need to cut through it to get him out of there. Logically speaking, the big boulder he's using as a temporary shelter should have some small holes in it to allow him to breathe, and also a lot of empty space inside it for him to be able to sit comfortably, so the rock's surface shouldn't be all that thick.

That being said, this rock has clearly been magically enforced like all the others, so it's going to take considerable strength for me to cut through it either way.

All of a sudden, a highly sharpened spike made out of the rock below us quickly flies into my right hand and it makes me drop my weapon. Before I get the chance to retrieve it, the earth elementalist escapes my grasp, throwing himself off his floating rock and onto a newly created floating stone platform below him, as hundreds of boulders are now flying at me from all directions. Given that there is no room for me to escape, I inevitably end up getting crushed by the multitude of rocks and I die soon afterwards.

 "I'll try flying closer to the ambassador and the captain," I say, as I am floating slightly above the ground. "If I attack them from another angle, maybe the captain will have a harder time maintaining his defenses."

"Make sure to look out for the floating boulders above us," Illuna says. "There's no telling when the earth elementalist who created them will decide to drop them on us."

"Thanks, I'll keep that in mind," I say. "Be right back."

I then raise myself a little higher into the air and I fly all the way over to the captain's side, positioning myself about two dozen feet above him and the ambassador. After shooting a few crossbow bolts which are easily repelled by the captain's barrier, I begin reloading the crossbow and in the meantime I try to strike up a conversation with my old friend, the ambassador of Ollendor.

"Hey, ambassador," I say loudly. "Long time no see!"

 "Don't talk to me, you murderer!" the ambassador shouts back. "I will make sure you pay for what you have done!"

"But we already did pay for that!" I say, as I shoot the captain's barrier a few more times. "We were forced to participate in an arena event that was specifically designed to kill us, and you were even allowed to organize it however you wanted. It's not my fault that you're such a bad organizer, you know."

"Shut up!" the ambassador shouts in a louder voice than before. "This isn't Thilias anymore, do you understand?! The gnome king and the arena owner won't save you this time! I am the one in control here! The royal guards and the whole army of Ollendor have been placed under my command for the sole purpose of killing you!"

"I know, and I'm really grateful for that!" I say. "I mean, can you even imagine what an army would have done to us if it weren't being controlled by an incompetent buffoon such as yourself?"

"Silence!" the ambassador shouts again. "I've heard enough from you! Captain, I order you to execute this man right now!"

"Ambassador, if I attack him now, the barrier will weaken and your safety will be put at ris--" the captain starts to say, but he is interrupted.

"I don't care!" the ambassador shouts angrily. "I want you to kill him now! Do it! That's an order!"

He then stretches his right arm towards me and he quickly pulls it down, with his hand being closed into a fist, as if he were grabbing onto a rope that's attached to me or something. Not even a second afterwards, an invisible force pulls me down several feet before I manage to break away from it and to aim my crossbow directly at the ambassador.

"Warning! Warning!" I hear the voice of the Overseer, whose green-eyed drone was apparently still following me. "The Overseer protocol is detecting aura manipulation techniques dangerously close to this unit's coordinates. If you do not stop immediately, this unit will be forced to call for backup."

"Overseer, you were ordered to retreat," the captain says. "Leave this area now, or you will face the consequences."

I take advantage of the captain's distraction to shoot a few bolts into the now weakened barrier, and I manage to hit the ambassador in the right side of his chest.

I shoot a few bolts at him and one of them actually gets through the barrier, hitting the ambassador in the right side of his chest.

 "Hah!" I say. "I did it!"

I barely get to finish what I was saying before I feel an immensely powerful pressure pushing me down, making me fall with my back against the captain's semi-transparent barrier and completely restricting all of my movements. As I am trying to break myself free from the aura manipulation technique, the captain pulls out a heavily enchanted dagger and he uses it to stab me in the back of the head from below. His magically sharpened weapon passes through my skull with ease, killing me on the spot.

 "What are you doing, you fool?!" the ambassador shouts at the captain. "He's getting away!"

"The further away he gets, the harder it will be to attack him without dismissing this barrier completely," the captain says. "He will die soon enough, don't worry. There's no need to rush things."

The ambassador looks like he's fuming, but he is staying silent for once. After I get pulled back one last time, I finally make it out of the captain's attack range and I head back towards Kate and Illuna where it's... safe?...

 Hmm... it looks like while I've been busy with the captain, the black-robed royal guard who ambushed us yesterday teleported in the middle of the battlefield and started attacking both Kate and Illuna with flying swords that he created out of nowhere. Kate and Flower are still attacking the captain of the guards with projectiles, so they can't really do much against the black-robed guy, while Illuna is having trouble hitting him due to his constant teleportation.

Neither Melindra nor Kelrim can really do much to help them either, and Daren is busy maintaining a magical barrier that is defending him and Leila from the air elementalist elf's attacks, so he can't intervene. Let's see if I can help out a little.

I decide to slightly change my flight direction, trying to somehow end up behind the black robed mage in order to take him by surprise.

 Kate manages to get out of the way in time, but now the black-robed man is creating weapons out of thin air and making them fly towards her and Illuna while he keeps teleporting around, waving his dagger at them. As Kate is busy blocking the flying weapons, she is also making sure to keep the pressure on the ambassador, so that he doesn't get a chance to escape during all the confusion.

After dodging the black-robed man's attacks a few times, Illuna suddenly decides to stop moving and she just stands there for a few seconds, while the man swings his dagger towards her. Seeing that she is not planning to evade his strike, the man stops his slash right as he was about to cut through her arm, and then he teleports next to Kate instead. Realizing what's going on, Kate stops moving as well, and as she does this, the man in black robes simply stops doing anything, while his flying weapons also appear to be frozen in mid-air.

"I think we've let this poorly made illusion distract us long enough," Illuna says, as she sends a few water lances towards the ambassador, while the black-robed man slowly fades away. "Let's keep attacking the ambassador. As long as the captain is required to keep his barrier up, he won't be able to use his powers to immobilize us again."

 Kate somehow manages to get out of the way, but she isn't fast enough to fully avoid the attack, so the man is still able to lightly wound her right shoulder before she is out of his reach.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, the black-robed man's head gets cut clean off his shoulders and all of the weapons that were floating in mid-air are now dropping to the ground, along with the robed man's lifeless body.

 The acid almost immediately melts through my skin and muscles, causing me a huge amount of pain while I also become unable to breathe. After a few more agonizing moments, I finally begin to lose my senses, as I slowly succumb to my death.

Kate somehow manages to get out of the way, but she isn't fast enough to fully avoid the attack, so the man is still able to lightly wound her right shoulder before she is out of his reach. Even though she is now hurt and under attack by a new adversary, Kate does not forget about her primary target, and she is still sending ice cones towards the ambassador, in order to keep up the pressure and to not let him escape.

As the black-robed man is now conjuring swords out of nowhere and making them fly towards Kate, Illuna also joins the fray, swinging her water whips at the man in robes as he keeps teleporting around constantly. Meanwhile, Flower is still sending fire projectiles towards the captain of the guards so that he is forced to keep his barrier up and not join the fight.

"Looks like Kate and Illuna are having some trouble with that teleporting guy," I tell Daren and Leila. "I'll go see if I can help out a little."

Before Daren and Leila get the chance to answer, I fly away from them and straight for the man in black robes, hoping to take him by surprise. What happens instead is that he is the one who surprises me, because as soon as I get close enough to him he teleports right in front of me and he shoots a spray of acid out of his left palm, aiming for my neck.

 Thanks to my aura hardening stat the acid doesn't do any serious damage, even though it still stings a little, so I decide to wipe it off with my hand and to fling it back towards my attacker with a quick motion of my wrist.

The black-robed man was not expecting this at all, so he was too slow to react properly. As soon as the acid touched his face he instinctively teleported away and back to the ground, but that didn't help him get the burning liquid out of his eyes so now he's just wiping his face constantly with his hands while groaning in pain.

These few seconds of distraction cost him dearly, because Illuna was waiting all this time for him to stop teleporting, and his momentary pause was all she needed to swing one of her water whips towards him at high speed and to behead him in a single movement.

As I give Illuna a victory salute, she nods back at me and then she begins to attack the captain of the guards again, together with Kate and Flower.

With the black-robed guy now dead, I land on the ground near Kate and Illuna and I take another look at the whole battlefield, in order to assess our current situation.

 What catches my eye the most is the unusual movement of the boulders in the sky. It looks like the earth elementalist is preparing for something. Is he finally going to use the rocks to attack everyone on the ground?

"Those boulders up in the sky have begun to move," I tell Kate and Illuna. "I think we're going to need some magical barriers soon."

"I'll make a wind barrier, but you'll need to get a little closer together first," Melindra says.

As soon as Kate, Flower, Kelrim and I get within five feet of Melindra, she begins to cast her protective spell and a semi-transparent barrier slowly materializes all around us.

"I'd rather keep focusing on attacking the captain until Melindra's barrier fails," Kate says. "The last thing we need is for him to immobilize us again while rocks are falling on our heads."

"Can't you make your ice dome slightly transparent so that you can see the captain through it and continue to shoot your icicles at him?" I say.

"Yes," Kate says, "but as soon as I will start concentrating on reinforcing the ice dome, my icicles will become weaker, and that might give the captain the chance to strike back at us."

 What catches my eye the most is what's currently happening in the sky. The big rocks that were floating high above us have more than doubled in number since the last time I looked at them. Does this mean that the earth elementalist has just been creating boulders non-stop since the beginning of the battle? 

All of a sudden, the rocks in the sky begin to move around in a very unusual manner, as if the earth elementalist were preparing for something. This isn't looking good. Maybe I should tell the others about this.

"Those boulders up in the sky have begun to move," I tell Kate and Illuna. "I think we're going to need some magical barriers soon."

 Not long after we set up our defenses, the earth elementalist also finishes his preparations and now all of his boulders are nicely aligned so that he can more easily throw them at us. The first wave he sends towards us is made up of only ten rocks, probably to test the durability of our barriers. Fortunately for us, none of them manage to get past Daren's protective spell, even if the boulders were all fairly large and were coming from every direction.

Now that he has gotten a better idea of what to expect, the earth elementalist is sending down around fifty large rocks at very high speeds, from every angle possible. Some of the rocks are round, while others have sharp tips, likely enhanced by magical sharpening as well as heavy reinforcement. Once they hit Daren's semi-transparent barrier, the majority of the boulders either slide off it or break into pieces from the force of the impact, but none of them are getting through.

That is a relief. For a moment there, I wasn't sure if Daren's defenses could withstand such a relentless assault, but I'm glad to see I was mistaken--

Before I get to finish my train of thought, two smaller boulders pass through both Daren and Melindra's barriers with ease, and one of them hits me in the head before I even get the time to realize what's going on.

The pain I'm feeling right now is pretty bad and I'm almost certain that I will be getting a bump on my head because of this, but if my toughness stat were any lower, my skull could have easily cracked, so I guess I should be thankful that I'm still alive.

I should not have gotten so relaxed back there. I need to remember that this is still the middle of a battlefield. If I make another blunder like that, it may well prove fatal. I can't afford to get lost in my own thoughts like this again.

"Barry, are you alive?!" Kate says, sounding slightly panicked, as she quickly makes a somewhat transparent ice dome around us.

"I'm fine..." I say. "My head hurts a little, but I'm fine. My toughness stat really saved me back there. I'm really glad that I put some points into it."  

 "I'll try to keep up the pressure on the captain while I maintain the dome, but it won't be easy," Kate says. "Don't be too surprised if he manages to retaliate soon."

"Actually, Kate," Daren says, as he points towards the sky, where about a hundred or more huge boulders are preparing to rain down upon us, "I think you should give up on the captain and put everything you've got into fortifying your ice dome. My barrier's beginning to reach its limit, and wind barriers aren't all that good against rocks, as you've no doubt already realized by now. Also, if the earth elementalist will send a few more regular rocks like those two from earlier, your dome will be the only reliable defense we have against them."

"Very well," Kate says. "I will focus all of my efforts on defense, then. Let's hope we won't come to regret this decision later."

She then begins to pour as much magical energy into her ice dome as she can, making it a lot more opaque in the process. It is harder now to see what is going on outside our shelter, but once the boulders start hitting the ice dome we can easily tell exactly what's happening.

 The rocks just keep coming one after the other, but Kate's reinforced ice is still holding strong. We can almost sense the earth elementalist's frustration, as he keeps hitting the dome across its whole surface, trying to find any kind of weak point. He even sends ten consecutive boulders in the exact same spot once, in the hopes that Kate won't be able to recreate and reinforce the ice fast enough to block them. In the end, none of his tactics work and although Kate's dome looks as if it were ready to crumble any minute, the rocks from the sky are no longer falling, presumably because after all this time the earth elementalist finally ran out of ammo.

Just as we are about to relax a little, the ice dome above us gets destroyed completely and then we feel the captain's aura pushing us into the ground with a greater force than ever before.

As my friends gather in one place and Kate builds a dome out of reinforced ice around them, I try to help out as well as I can by positioning myself directly above them and slicing through as many of the falling rocks as possible.

Eventually, the large boulders stop falling and everyone escapes unharmed, including our enemies, while Hadrik and Gontrok are still continuing their fight as if nothing happened.

 Right after the captain stops talking, Daren is slammed into the ground by an invisible force, like the rest of us. For a moment, I see Daren's sword budging a few inches as he tries to make it fly back into his hand, but the pain in his wrist is clearly preventing him from focusing properly. 

The captain does not notice what Daren is trying to do, and instead he directs his attention towards Gontrok, who is still fighting Hadrik.

"Gontrok!" the captain shouts. "Come here and help me destroy this ice wall behind me! The ambassador is trapped and can't get to safety!"

"I'm a little busy here, captain," Gontrok says, as he blocks Hadrik's fist with his right hand and then crouches to avoid a kick to his face.

"Damn it..." the captain says, and now he turns his gaze towards the air elementalist elf. "Hey, Felsig! Get over here and cut a hole through this wall with your wind magic! And don't try to execute the criminals while you're on your way here. That's an order!"

"What?..." the elf says. "Why would you want them alive?"

"I don't," the captain says, "but with the amount of tricks they've pulled out of their sleeves so far, I wouldn't be surprised if they were to make use of your own wind blades to free themselves or even kill you. I'm not taking that risk. The ambassador's safety remains our highest priority."

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_air == 0 && v_b3_ch6_tie == 1) {
 "Fine, I'll be right there," Felsig says, and then he begins heading towards the captain.

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_tie == 0 && v_b3_ch6_air >= 1) {
 "Of course he can't hear me..." the captain says. "Loyrang, can you-- no, never mind, your swords aren't sharp enough to cut through this wall... Ambassador, I'm afraid that you're going to have to go through the main street and then take that alleyway over there in order to return to your shelter. Do you understand?"

"You're telling me to get even closer to those murderers while you're not there to protect me?!" the ambassador says. "What if they kill me?"

"They're not going to kill you," the captain says. "They are all being immobilized, and I will make a small mobile barrier between you and them to protect you as you walk, just in case. Now please go to your shelter. Even I can't hold them like this forever."

"I will go," the ambassador says, "but if anything happens to me, you will pay with your life! Mark my words!"

"Duly noted," the captain says, as the ambassador is now heading into the street we are in, so he can reach his shelter.

 Even under these conditions, Daren still somehow manages to cancel the invisible force by moving his sword very slightly to the right, and then he quickly gets up, making a rush for the captain, while all of the boulders and the rubble around us that had been magically created are now slowly fading into thin air.

The captain of the guards puts both his hands in front of him and uses his aura manipulation technique to push Daren away, while he uses the pressure from before to immobilize the rest of us again. The next thing that the captain tries to do is pull Daren's sword away from him, but he ends up pulling on his whole arm along with the sword, because the weapon simply won't detach itself from the palm of his hand.

"You are using... aura manipulation to glue your sword to your hand?" the captain asks Daren, somewhat surprised. "It looks like you've learned a few tricks since the last time I saw you. However--"

Daren's wrist suddenly begins to twist in a very unnatural way, as he struggles to suppress a scream of pain. After a few seconds, the sword finally unglues itself from his palm and flies into the hands of the guard captain.

"--anyone can clearly see that you are still a novice at aura manipulation," the captain continues, as he throws Daren's sword away while looking at him in disgust. "A small twist of the wrist is all that it takes to break your concentration at your current level. Now lay down on the ground, where you and your kind belong."

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_tie == 0 && v_b3_ch6_air >= 1 || v_b3_ch6_tie == 1 && v_b3_ch6_air >= 1) {
 Right after the captain stops talking, Daren is slammed into the ground by an invisible force, like the rest of us. For a moment, I see Daren's sword budging a few inches as he tries to make it fly back into his hand, but the pain in his wrist is clearly preventing him from focusing properly. 

The captain does not notice what Daren is trying to do, and instead he directs his attention towards Gontrok, who is still fighting Hadrik.

"Gontrok!" the captain shouts. "Come here and help me destroy this ice wall behind me! The ambassador is trapped and can't get to safety!"

"I'm a little busy here, captain," Gontrok says, as he blocks Hadrik's fist with his right hand and then crouches to avoid a kick to his face.

"Damn it..." the captain says, and now he turns his gaze towards the sky, shouting loudly in the hopes that his voice will reach the earth elementalist. "Bolwick, can you hear me?!"

He waits for a few seconds, but he gets no answer.

}
#if(v_b3_ch6_tie == 1 && v_b3_ch6_air >= 1) {
 "Of course he can't hear me..." the captain says. "Ambassador, I'm afraid that you're going to have to go through the main street and then take that alleyway over there in order to return to your shelter. Do you understand?"

"I can't do that because the captain keeps moving them around," Arraka says. "He's obviously not planning to let us get the upper hand on him again."

All of a sudden, the captain and the ambassador both get surrounded by a golden cage, which was most likely cast by Illuna. Unfortunately, our situation does not change at all, and the force pushing us down is still as strong as ever.

"What?!" Arraka shouts furiously. "Why would you that?! Why would you cast the cage on him of all people? Have you learned nothing from my lessons?"

"Hmm..." the captain says, as he lightly touches one of the cage's bars. "I've seen this type of cage before. If I remember correctly, this spell is very vulnerable to aura manipulation techniques, is it not? Let me see..."

He then does a short waving motion with his hands and all of the cage's bars begin to bend until their shapes become completely distorted and turn into spirals. Soon afterwards, the spirals start spinning more and more rapidly until they become too blurry to be seen clearly, and eventually the whole cage fades away into nothingness.

"Oh, no you don't," the captain says. "This sword is staying with me."

He then begins to slowly amplify the pressure on top of us, probably trying to squish us to death.

"I've been trying to avoid this technique lately because of the huge strain it places on my frail, old body," the captain tells us, "but even if this puts me out of commission for a whole week, it will have been worth it. There will be no more tricks to save you this time. The only thing left for you to do is to lie there quietly and accept your deaths with dignity."

The invisible force above us is getting stronger with each passing moment. The pain is becoming more and more unbearable to the point that most of us have already given up on trying to keep quiet and we're now just screaming our lungs out.

Meanwhile, Loyrang finally reaches us after dragging his feet this whole time, and he stops right in front of me with one of his two long swords unsheathed and ready to strike.

"No hard feelings, mate!" Loyrang says to me in a low voice. "I need to at least pretend that I'm taking this seriously."

He then uses his sword to stab me in my right shoulder, and I try hard to stifle a groan of pain as he now takes out his weapon and blood starts flowing out.

"Whoa..." Loyrang says. "That looks like a pretty nasty wound. Might want to put some pressure on it if you don't want to die of blood loss!"

I feel like punching this guy in his smug face so hard right now. Even if he did avoid killing me on purpose, his mocking tone and the pain from my shoulder are making it so that the only thoughts now racing through my head are ways to make him pay.

 "Loyrang, I told you to execute these people, not play around with them," the captain shouts. "Step aside, I'll do it myself."

"Aye, aye, captain," Loyrang says, as he now walks back from us in the same lazy way that he's moved since he first came here.

The captain now begins to slowly amplify the pressure on top of us, probably trying to squish us to death. Ironically, since the increased pressure is also pushing on my shoulder, the blood has now mostly stopped pouring out of my wound.

"I've been trying to avoid this technique lately because of the huge strain it places on my frail, old body," the captain tells us, "but even if this puts me out of commission for a whole week, it will have been worth it.

"You are getting ahead of yourself, healer," the captain says. "Let's see how cocky you'll be after I break your second wrist."

As soon as he says this, the captain attempts to twist Daren's left hand with his aura manipulation, but Daren simply flicks his fingers a little and the effects of the captain's technique wear off immediately. Seeing that his old tactic no longer works, the captain of the guards now tries to push his opponent away with the invisible force, but Daren puts his hands in front of him and simply blocks it.

As he is holding his arms outstretched, his sword now flies away from where it was thrown on the ground and straight into his left hand.

 All of a sudden, I hear Rose shouting through the transceiver, and I quickly notice that the world around us is completely frozen again, including Hadrik and Gontrok, who were continuing their fight somewhere far away from us.

"Barry, can you move?!" Rose says loudly.

"Rose?..." I say, confused. "How did you know when to--"

"I don't have time to explain!" Rose says, talking very quickly in order to save time. "What is happening to the pressure above you? Can you set yourselves free?"

"I'm afraid not," I say, after trying in vain to get back on my feet. "The invisible force is no longer squishing us, but it's still pinning us to the ground."

"Oh no..." Rose says, as I can feel her starting to panic. "No, no, no, no... I thought for sure this would work! I can't keep the time frozen for much longer... Please, please, please, you need to come up with something! There has to be a way to save yourselves before my spell--"

"Guys, are you seeing what I'm seeing?..." Daren asks us all of a sudden, as he is looking at the empty air above him.

 "No, Daren," I say, "we're not seeing anything, but if you're planning to do something, you'd better do it quick, before--"

"Everything is so clear now..." Daren says, looking almost as if he were in some kind of trance. "When it's frozen in time like this, the captain's aura is so much easier to understand. Arraka was right! The flows really do look like strings tied into a knot!"

"Daren, I don't-- ugh... I don't know what you're saying," Rose says, as she is clearly making great efforts to keep the time frozen. "Please, if you've figured out something, do it fast... I can't... I am barely even able to remain conscious right now..."

"It's alright, Rose," Daren says, in a calm but confident tone. "You can let go of the spell. I will take care of the captain."

"Okay..." Rose says. "I hope you know what you're doing."

The time then immediately gets unfrozen and just as I am beginning to feel the pressure from above crushing me again, Daren lifts his left hand in the air, he closes his fist, and the invisible force that was pushing us down disappears completely.

 "It's over, captain," Daren says, as he gets up from the ground and begins to walk slowly towards him. "Surrender now, and I won't have to kill you."

"You are getting ahead of yourself, healer," the captain says. "Let's see how cocky you'll be after I break your second wrist."

As soon as he says this, the captain attempts to twist Daren's left hand with his aura manipulation, but Daren simply flicks his fingers a little and the effects of the captain's technique wear off immediately. Seeing that his old tactic no longer works, the captain of the guards now tries to push his opponent away with the invisible force, but Daren puts his hands in front of him and simply blocks it.

As he is holding his arms outstretched, his sword now flies away from the captain and straight into his left hand.

 "Don't come any closer!" says the air elementalist elf, who is now standing right beside the captain. "I'm warning you!"

When he sees that his warning is being ignored, the air elementalist sends a wind blade at Daren, who uses his sword to absorb it and to send it straight back at his enemy. The elf somehow manages to block the incoming attack with a wind barrier, and then he makes a small tornado between him and Daren in order to prevent him from going forward. What Daren does instead is to put his sword into the whirlwind, which to our shock makes it become smaller and smaller until it turns into this small spinning gray wind that keeps rotating around Daren's blade.

"What?!" the elf shouts. "No! No, this is just ridiculous!"

"Why are you so surprised?" Daren says. "No matter how fast you spin it, an element is still an element. As long as the tornado is small enough, I can still absorb it. Here, you can have it back."

 He then swings his sword in the elf's direction, as the small tornado gets flung away from the blade and straight for the air elementalist, getting bigger and bigger until it reaches its original size.

"Aah!" the elf screams. "Get away from me!"

As he runs away, the tornado keeps following him, and now the captain who was forced to move out of the whirlwind's way is finding himself in a bit of a bind, because Daren has taken advantage of this distraction to close in on him fast. Before he gets to react, Daren sticks his sword through his heart, killing the man almost immediately. The captain soon falls to the ground in a puddle of his own blood, as Daren calmly sheathes his sword and turns back to look at us.

 Although the captain tries many more times to push Daren away from him, he fails repeatedly, and now that Daren has his weapon back we can clearly see that it's much easier for him to repel his enemy's attacks. When Daren gets within striking distance of his opponent, the captain tries one last desperate gamble by conjuring the semi-invisible sword that he used before to cut down Illuna's water serpent and by swinging it as hard as he can towards the healer in armor.

Sadly for him, he does not have enough energy left in him to make his weapon anywhere near as powerful as before, and Daren cuts through it in a flash, beheading the captain in the same movement. As the captain's headless body falls into a puddle of his own blood, Daren calmly sheathes his sword and he turns to look at us.

While all this is happening, I get a sudden premonition in which I see the captain getting a headache that makes him lose control of his aura manipulation technique, and immediately afterwards I see another vision of Daren carrying Kelrim's lifeless corpse with a very grim expression in his eyes.

Does this mean that Kelrim is going to sacrifice himself to cast his nausea spell on the captain? Would I still be able to stop him if I told him not to do it? Damn it, this pain is so agonizing that it's hard to think straight.

 As the pain becomes greater, it gets increasingly difficult to maintain my consciousness. During this time, Kate and Flower shoot a few projectiles at the captain, but they get easily blocked by him. Daren also tries desperately to get his sword back, but he is much too weakened to focus on his aura technique properly.

While my life is flashing before my eyes, for some reason I suddenly remember the words that Arraka said to Daren this morning: 'You obviously have a natural affinity for aura manipulation'.

Could this have meant that other members of our team may have had that affinity too? Would they have been able to do what Daren did with his aura if they had only practiced a little?... Why am I even thinking about this? It's too late to ask Arraka about this now. It's too late to do anything anymore. I may as well just... go to sleep.

When the pain finally overcomes me, I lose my consciousness for good and I die soon afterwards, along with everyone else.

"At this rate we're all going to die!" Kelrim shouts. "It's better if I'm the only one who loses his life, instead of everyone. I'm just a goblin. Goblins die all the time. Nobody will be sad when I'm gone!"

"Damn it, Kelrim!" Daren says, as he is clearly struggling to form a proper sentence due to the pain. "Don't you dare say something like that again! I forbid you to kill yourself, do you understand?! Either we all get out of here alive or we all die together. Nobody gets left behind!"

"How touching," the captain says, in a cold tone of voice. "I hope you're done saying your goodbyes, because you will soon be getting your wish granted. You will all die here together."

 Not long after the captain stops talking, we feel the pressure above us suddenly disappearing, even though it doesn't look like Daren did anything this time. As we are all getting up from the ground, confused, the captain is staring at Kate while pointing at her, with an incredulous look on his face.

"You did this?!" the captain says. "With an icicle, of all things? What kind of a half-assed improvisation is this?!"

I now realize that Kate was holding an icicle in her hand this whole time. She must have been trying to copy Daren's 'untangling' technique ever since he lost his sword.

Instead of answering the captain's question, Kate sends several icicles his way, while Flower and Illuna send their own projectiles towards him as well. It is clear that Kate and Illuna have both used up most of their magical energy by now, because their attacks are significantly weaker than they were before. Flower, on the other hand seems to have been a little more careful with her energy spending, because her magic is just as strong as it was in the beginning.

 "Hey, Daren, your armor has fire protection on it, right?" Flower says.

"Yeah, it does," Daren answers her. "But why do you--"

"Perfect!" Flower says, and then we see a large wyvern made completely out of flames, flying down and grabbing Daren into its claws.

The wyvern then soars into the air, holding tightly onto Daren as it advances rapidly towards the captain.

"Don't worry," Flower shouts after Daren, "the flames have been properly solidified with reinforcement magic, so there is no danger of you being dropped by accident! Probably!"

 When the wyvern is seconds away from reaching its target, the captain once again takes the posture of a swordsman, looking as if he were holding an invisible blade with both hands. As he swings his sword, we can see the weapon's outline shining from the sun's light while Daren puts his shield to the side, preparing to defend himself. The captain does not aim for Daren, however, and he cuts the wyvern in half with one strike, as Daren is dropped by the flame creature and lands right beside his enemy.

The captain quickly attempts to use his semi-invisible blade to kill his opponent, but by this point it is clear that he is too exhausted to keep his weapon materialized properly. His weakened aura sword is no match for Daren's enchanted blade, which cuts through it in an instant and beheads its wielder in the same movement.

The elf makes a wind barrier to defend himself, and when he realizes that there is nothing more he can do he quickly casts some air currents around himself, similar to the ones that Melindra always casts on me, and he flies away in order to avoid getting burned to death by the fire wyvern.

While I am watching him fly, I quickly realize that this guy barely has any control over his air currents, unlike Melindra or me, because he is moving through the air in a completely chaotic way, as if he were being carried away by a strong wind or something. He must have been really desperate if he still decided to try flying even under these conditions.

After enduring the pain for a while longer, I suddenly feel the pressure above me disappearing, as the captain seems to be experiencing a very strong headache. When he realizes that he lost control of his aura technique, he tries to push us down again, but he can't make the invisible force strong enough to pin us to the ground anymore, so he eventually gives up, making a barrier in front of him instead.

"A headache?..." Daren says, as he's gradually starting to panic. "Kelrim, please don't tell me that you cast the risky spell you told us about earlier... Kelrim?... "

"I'm sorry," Illuna says with a serious look in her eyes, as she seems to have just finished taking the pulse of the goblin who is now lying on the ground, motionless. "He's dead."

 I decide to not say anything to Kelrim. If he is truly determined to cast that spell, then there is probably nothing I can say that would make him change his mind.

 "Is everyone safe?" Rose asks, in an anxious voice. "Please tell me that nobody died!"

"We're all alive, Rose," Kate says. "Thanks to you. Your timing was impeccable. How did you know exactly when to call us?"

"I didn't," Rose says. "I actually called Barry a little earlier, because I wanted to tell him that I could probably still use my time-freezing power once more for the day in case you guys needed it. But before I got the chance to say anything, I realized from the noises that you were all in the middle of a battle, so I decided that I should just wait for the right opportunity to help, instead of calling out to you and making you lose your focus."

"Well, your intervention couldn't have been timed any better," Daren says. "We may well have all died without your help."

"Your friend on the transceiver..." Kelrim says. "She froze the time? Is that why you were able to cancel the captain's aura technique all of a sudden?"

"Oh, that's right, you were also frozen by Rose's spell so you couldn't tell what was happening," Daren says. "Yes, Rose froze the time for a while, and that gave me the opportunity to-- Kelrim, are you alright?... Your face looks really pale! I mean... at least I think it's pale. It's not normal for it to be such a light shade of green, is it?"

"Oh, I'm fine..." Kelrim says. "It's just... it's just that... if your friend hadn't intervened, I would have most likely cast that nausea spell that I told you about before on the captain. I may have been only seconds away from ending my own life, and the thought of that terrifies me a little."

I then approach the fallen drone and I begin to study it from all the angles, in the hopes that I will uncover some useful information. As I am slowly circling around it, I suddenly hear three short beeps coming from the metal ball, and then it immediately self-destructs, generating an explosion so powerful that it obliterates me and everyone in the area in an instant.

We all sprint away from the drone, with Daren making sure to be the last one in the group so that he can hold a protective barrier between us and the metal ball with his shield. When he reaches Kelrim's dead body, Daren picks it up from the ground and puts it on his right shoulder, while he continues to run.

 Even with the distance we've put between us and the drone, the impact of the blast still managed to reach us but we were already pretty far from the center of the explosion so it was nothing that Daren’s barrier couldn’t handle. As we now stop to look at the singeing hot earth forming the crater behind us and at all the windows that were broken by the explosion’s shockwave, I immediately turn my eyes towards the drones in the sky that are still floating innocently, as if they were completely unaware of what's happening below.

"I guess you're not our Overseer expert for nothing," Daren says, as he is still looking at the scorched earth from the area we left. "If we were any closer to that explosion, things could have ended pretty badly."

"I don't think it's over yet," I tell him, as I'm still looking attentively at the sky. "The Overseer seems to have finally found a way to attack us despite his self-imposed 'maintenance mode'. He's not going to stop until he runs out of drones that he can drop on us. Illuna, could you cool down that hot crater a little?"

"Will do," she says, and then she sends a small torrent of water to flood the hole in the ground that has formed from the explosion.

 When the water comes in contact with the flaming hot rocks, a good deal of it evaporates from the heat, but this helps to lower the temperature of the ground enough for us to be able to walk on it again. Once the earth is all cooled down, Illuna dismisses the leftover water, and then she looks at me.

"The ground has been cooled," Illuna tells me.

Two more drones fall from the sky and land near our position, as we all run back to our initial spot. In the meantime, Kate conjures an ice wall behind us and Daren once again makes a semi-transparent barrier with his shield. The drones explode a little quicker this time and the flames melt through the ice wall, but the obstacle placed by Kate is still enough to stop them from reaching Daren's shield. As we manage to climb down the crater and to get back to our original location successfully, I look at the sky one more time to confirm my suspicions.

It looks like the Overseer is indeed still unable to move his drones. All he can do is drop them on us and use them like bombs. His timing with the detonation has gotten a little better on his second attempt, but it doesn't matter. The only drone that was directly above this area was the one he used to attack us at the beginning. There are no more weapons for him to use against us. For now, we should be safe.

"Well," I say, "he did tell us that that the 'routine' which made him give a damn about the citizens of Varathia was deactivated, so I suppose this was to be expected."

"Choosing to run away from the metal ball was a surprisingly good decision, coming from someone like you," Albert says, as I now see him coming out of invisibility. "Maybe it wasn't a coincidence that you survived in the mage tournament for so long."

"I'm guessing that the first thing you did when you saw the drone falling from the sky was to turn invisible and to get as far away from it as possible, then?" I say.

"Obviously," Albert says.

"I'll call Barry to teleport us out of here before anything else happens," Daren says, as he takes out his transceiver again.

"Yes, I could hear you the last time you called me too!" the teleporter guy says. "You were the ones who couldn't hear what I was saying for some reason."

"Well, we can hear you now," Daren says. "With a little luck, maybe this means that our signal is no longer being blocked."

"Pardon me for asking, but... the last time you called I overheard you talking about the royal guards having you surrounded," the teleporter guy says. "It doesn't look like you're in a battle anymore, so what happened to the guards?"

"The ones that survived used their teleportation devices to return to their king," Daren says. "Gontrok forced them to retreat after we killed their captain."

"So we're just going to let the ambassador go, then?..." Melindra asks us out of the blue.

"The ambassador?" Daren says, looking as if he's still processing the information Melindra just gave him. "He's still here?..."

"Yes, the royal guards abandoned him when they teleported to their king, remember?" Melindra says. "He's still hiding in the same abandoned house where the captain sent him to take shelter during the battle."

"Oh, yeah!" Hadrik says. "Now that you mention it, I think I can sense his aura too! He's not too far from us!"

"Barry, come on!" Daren says. "We don't have time for this!"

"I promise that it'll only take a minute!" I say, as I run through one of the alleyways, with the crossbow in my hands. "I'll be right back!"

While I move, I make sure to keep a lookout for the drones in the sky, because the last thing I'd want is for the Overseer to drop one of them on me while I'm not paying attention. Luckily for me, there don't seem to be any drones above the house in which the ambassador is hiding, so at least I won't have to worry about a surprise attack.

I quickly make my way towards the ambassador, using my magical sense to pinpoint his exact location. When I finally reach the house he's in, I open the door and I see him standing in a corner, holding a knife with both hands and staring straight at me, with a look full of hatred in his eyes.

"If you come any closer, I'll kill you!" the ambassador shouts at me. "I will gut you with this knife, do you understand?! Stay back!"

"Don't be like that, ambassador!" I tell him, as I calmly load some bolts into my crossbow and take a few steps towards him. "I'm sure that somewhere deep down you always knew it would end this way."

"No, ambassador," I tell him as I now aim my crossbow at his forehead. "You are the peasant!"

I then shoot the ambassador in the head, killing him before he has the chance to say anything else. As soon as I'm done, I walk out of the house and I head back towards Daren and the others, who were waiting impatiently for my return.

"Oh, good," Daren says, when he sees me. "You're back. Come over here. We're all ready to teleport."

"So..." Hadrik says, after I reach them. "The ambassador's dead, huh?"

"Yep," I say.

"I feel like I'm gonna miss the poor bastard," Hadrik says. "I mean, I still hated his guts, but hearing him shouting his lungs out every time he saw us would always bring a smile to my face, you know what I'm saying?"

"Don't worry," I tell him. "He will still live on in your memories."

"Aye," Hadrik says. "And if not him, then his voice surely will."

"He... sacrificed himself for our sake, and for the people in the quarantine area," Daren says, in a sad tone. "We would not have made it out of there alive if not for him. We are all in his debt..."

"I see," the teleporter guy says, as he looks away, towards the ground.

"I will take Kelrim back to the waiting room," Albert says, as he approaches Daren. "There are many people that would like to say their goodbyes to him, especially in the quarantine area."

"...Make sure that he gets a proper burial," Daren says, as he hands Kelrim's body to Albert somewhat hesitantly.

"We will do what we can," Albert says, and then he takes the goblin in his arms. "Now if you'll please excuse me, I need to go report the death of the captain of the guards to our king.
