 When our four hours were up, we went back to our room to wake up Kate and Leila. As the two of them were getting ready to take the next shift, Hadrik got up from his bed as well, saying that he wanted to practice his new techniques for a few hours in one of the emptier corridors. Once Hadrik, Kate and Leila left, Flower, Melindra and I went to sleep and we didn't wake up again until roughly four hours later, when everyone was already packing their bags and getting ready to leave. 

After quickly packing our bags as well, we called Hadrik on the transceiver and then we all met with him outside our room, so that we could head for the waiting room together.

"You doing okay, Hadrik?" Daren says, as he pats Hadrik on the shoulder while we are walking through one of the corridors. "Don't forget that you can always talk to us if you feel like there's something you need to get off your chest."

"I appreciate the concern, Daren, but you don't need to worry about me," Hadrik says. "I was having a bit of a bad day yesterday, but after a good night's sleep I feel completely refreshed and I'm all ready for a rematch! When are we leaving for the surface?"

"We'll leave as soon as we meet up with Kelrim," Daren says. "He's probably in the quarantine zone already, so I'll go get him as soon as we reach the waiting room."

"Are Illuna and Arraka with us too, or do we need to wake them up?" I say. "I haven't heard a word from either of them this morning."

 Albert seems to have been waiting for us to arrive, because as soon as he saw us walking out of the corridor, he immediately rushed in our direction. He is now standing in front of us, looking both tired and irritable. He must have been busy guiding refugees all night, without getting any time to sleep.

"The king of the underground has requested a meeting with you," Albert says, trying to act politely, although you can clearly tell from his tone of voice that he is forcing himself to talk like this. "He is waiting for you in the throne room. Follow me."

#if(v_b3_ch5_moustache == 2) {
 "Yeah, yeah, I'm awake," Arraka says. "Oh and I've already used a water spell to clean up that fake moustache, in case you were looking for it. Very amusing, by the way. I'm glad to know that you're putting all that free time to good use. Really looking forward to seeing you use these new skills of yours against Selkram in our final confrontation."

"Is that a challenge?" I ask Arraka.

"Sure, why not?" Arraka says.

"Then I will make sure to learn some good fake moustache spells just for Selkram as soon as I get my magic stats," I say. "Anyway, so did Illuna wake up too, or only Arraka?"

"Illuna is awake, but I don't think she'll answer you," Flower says. "I've been trying to talk to her since I woke up, but she keeps telling me that she is trying to learn a new spell and that she'll only speak to me when she's done."

"A new spell, huh?" I say. "Maybe it's something that can help us against the royal guards. Alright, let's leave her to it, then."

We walk down the corridors a bit more until we reach the waiting room. The commotion from nine hours ago seems to have died down a little, but I'm not sure if this is because they are done with the evacuation or because the rebels no longer have enough space in their base to offer shelter for all the refugees. Judging by all the civilians who are still in the waiting room, my guess would be that they really did run out of places where they could send people to sleep.

Albert nods and then he begins to walk towards the throne room, as the rest of us move to follow him.

After walking for a while, we finally reach the room where the king was waiting for us and we seat ourselves down on the empty chairs that are facing the throne. As we are taking our seats, Albert walks past us and he goes to join Peter, who is currently standing behind the king's throne. It seems that the two guards that are usually by the king's side have not been invited this time around. The only people here except for our group are the king of the underground, Albert and Peter.

"I suppose the king of the underground wouldn't have asked for a meeting so early in the morning if it weren't important..." Daren says. "Alright, let's see what he wants. Lead the way."

"I don't think I've made myself clear enough," Albert says, in a menacing tone. "I wasn't giving you an option. You WILL follow me to the throne room."

"Or what?" I say.

When he hears me, Albert gets an angry look in his eyes and he begins to walk towards me.

"Hey, hey, there's no need to get so upset," Daren says, as he places himself in front of Albert to stop him from advancing. "We're all friends here, right? Or at the very least we're somewhat on the same side. If your king's meeting is so important that it can't be delayed, then I'll just have to talk to Kelrim a little later. I'm guessing that he's in the quarantine area, right?"

"The goblin is indeed in the quarantine zone," Albert says. "You can speak to him after you return. Now follow me."

"Alright," Daren says. "Lead the way."

 All three of them seem very tired, and the king even has visible bags under his eyes. However, aside from the fatigue, I can also feel a certain... tension in the air that I haven't felt in our last two meetings. Hopefully it's just my imagination.

"Good morning, friends," the king says. "I hope you've slept well. My apologies for calling you to yet another meeting out of the blue, but there are quite a few things I need to discuss with you that can't be delayed any longer. First, allow me to give you a bit of context."

He then takes a small metal cube out of his pocket, just like the one that he used in our first meeting with him, and he holds it in front of us. 

"Your friend Eiden went out of his way again to lure some people into one of the few rooms from the palace in which we had recording devices," the king says. "I am assuming that he did this because he wanted you to listen to this conversation, so I will respect his wishes. The discussion that you are about to hear happened yesterday, shortly after the majority of you were mistakenly teleported to the trap-filled caverns below the city. I believe that you should be able to easily recognize most of, if not all the participants in this conversation. Let us begin."

He then presses one of the buttons from the metal cube device and we begin to hear voices coming out of it, just like the last time. As soon as I recognize the first voice, I immediately understand what this conversation is going to be about.

"Is this the room that you wanted to bring us to?..." the ambassador of Ollendor says.

 "Yes," Eiden says. "In here we should be safe from any spies that might be trying to listen to our conversation."

"I assure you, Creator, that there are no spies in this palace!" the king of Ollendor says. "There would be no way for them to get past our guards!"

"I do not doubt your guards' competence, great king," Eiden says. "But still, it is better to be safe than sorry."

"What is it that you wanted to speak to us about, ambassador?" the captain of the royal guards says.

"I... do not know where to begin..." the ambassador says. "It's just so hard for me to put this into words. My king, it is with a heavy heart that I've come to bring you the news that your brother... our beloved earl has been murdered in Thilias."

The king does not answer the ambassador in any way, and neither do any of the others. After more than five seconds of silence, the ambassador speaks again.

"My king?..." the ambassador says, in a slightly uneasy voice.

"Ambassador, I want you to think very carefully about your next words," the king of Ollendor says, in a frighteningly calm tone.  "What you are about to say from now on may well decide whether you live or die today. First of all, I want you to confirm to me one more time what you just told me. Are you absolutely certain that my brother is dead?"

 "Y-yes, your highness," the ambassador says, in a trembling voice. "I am certain of it. We've brought home his lifeless body as proof. Our mages did all they could to preserve the body with their spells, but it has been more than a week since his death, so you should be warned that the sight of him will be a bit shocking..."

"How did this happen?" the king asks, with the same calm voice.

"He was... attacked in the middle of the street by some tournament participants," the ambassador says. "The earl... fought valiantly for his life, but the mages used cowardly tactics to--"

"Some tournament participants did this?" the king asks. "How is this possible? Why haven't they been sent back to their own continents by the spell that prevents them from hurting the people of Varathia?"

"Yes, I am interested to know this as well!" Eiden says. "Tell us, ambassador, how were those villainous mages able to bypass such a reliable and non-exploitable protection spell?"

Even though I can't see them talking, I can easily imagine the smirk that Eiden must have on his face at this point in the conversation, as he is looking at the ambassador with his eyes closed, waiting for an answer.

"Aren't you going to answer them, ambassador?" the captain of the royal guards says, after a long pause.

 "We... don't know how these mages were able to bypass the protection spell," the ambassador says. "However, we have reasons to believe that they are capable of harming any of the locals, without any restrictions."

"And these tournament participants... they were executed for their crime?" the king asks, still in a calm tone, but you can tell that he is barely restraining himself at this point.

"...No, your highness," the ambassador says. "The gnome king was very opposed to the idea of executing them. Eventually we... reached a compromise and sentenced them to fight in one of the greatest arena events in our entire continent's history, but even without their magic they were somehow able to survive until the end, and so according to the laws written in the treaty between all kingdoms of Varathia, they were released on the same day that--"

"You let them go?!" the king of Ollendor shouts so loudly that I almost had to cover my ears. "You miserable worm, are you telling me that my brother's murderers are roaming around freely through Varathia at this very moment? I ought to chain you up and feed you to the dogs for your incompetence, you pathetic excuse for a diplomat. Is this why I sent you to Thilias? To negotiate with that idiot gnome as if he and I were equals? Why didn't you tell him that there would be war if he didn't execute those mages on the spot? You just let him walk all over you as if you were one of his lowly servants?!"

 "My king, I did try to tell him that there would be war, but he wouldn't listen," the ambassador says, in a panicky voice. "And besides, Golmyck was not the only one who took the side of the mages! In fact, the main reason why they were sent to the arena was because..."

The ambassador stops speaking suddenly, probably because he realized what would likely happen to him if he were to rat on Eiden in front of the king.

"Because..." the ambassador says again, in a more trembling voice.

I can probably imagine what the ambassador was thinking in these moments. Would it be better to be killed by the king, or by Eiden? Which one of them would be more likely to spare his life? Was mercy even something that either of those two would be capable of?

"If I may interject, your highness," the captain of the royal guards says when he realizes that the ambassador isn't planning to finish his sentence. "The intruders that I told you about earlier were also tournament participants, and they were more than capable of attacking me, despite being a citizen of Ollendor. The group that we fought had a fully armored, dark-skinned mage with an 'X' shaped scar on his forehead, a banshee that could use ice as a magical element, a little girl that could cast fire magic, and a giant that was shapeshifted as a dwarf. Do any of these descriptions sound familiar to you, ambassador?"

"That's them!" the ambassador shouts. "They are the ones who killed the earl! I'm sure of it!"

 "So my brother's killers were on my doorstep this whole time..." the king of Ollendor says, this time controlling the anger in his voice. "Captain, you told me that your men were almost able to apprehend some of these intruders before they teleported away at the last minute. Do you think that they are still inside the city?"

"Most definitely, your highness," the captain says. "Biliborrathrathsarran assured us that the invisible barrier he created around the city prevents anyone from teleporting past our walls using any conventional spells. The only way to get in or out of this city is through the city gates. Wherever these criminals are hiding, it must be inside the city."

"Then it is clear what we must do..." the king of Ollendor says, and then he takes a short pause before he speaks again. "Captain, I want the guards to scour every inch of this city until you find these mages, starting now. I don't care if it's almost night time. Wake up every single guard that we have and tell them to look in every nook and every cranny until there is no place left to hide. If our citizens refuse to open the doors to their houses, then you can assume that they are trying to harbor criminals and you are permitted to kill them on the spot. Nobody is allowed to enter or leave the city until all of my brother's murderers are found and executed. This city is going into full lockdown and you, ambassador, are going to oversee this whole operation, together with the captain."

"Me?..." the ambassador asks, in a slightly fearful tone.

 "Yes, ambassador," the king says. "I am putting you in charge of dealing with these criminals. You will be personally responsible for the results of this manhunt. I don't think I need to tell you what will happen to you if you fail to capture these mages a second time. I'm certain that your desire to right your wrongs will be more than enough motivation for you to do your job properly this time around."

"Yes, your majesty," the ambassador says. "Of course..."

"Good," the king says. "Then it's settled. I hope neither of you were hoping to sleep tonight, because I suspect that you are going to be quite busy for some time. Start making the necessary preparations. I want you two to come up with a plan of action in less than an hour. Oh, and captain... would you be so kind as to send one of the palace servants to bring Bilibo... Bilibo... the lessathi here? Tell him that it is a very urgent matter and that I am requesting his presence in the castle immediately. Surely there must be at least one of his devices that would be helpful to us in such a situation."

"Yes, my king," the captain says. "I will send someone to contact him at once."

 "I will meet you both in my throne room once you are done planning everything," the king says. "Do not keep me waiting."

We then hear some footsteps getting further away from the recording devices, as the king and presumably the captain of the royal guards are walking out of the room. Once we can no longer hear the steps, Eiden addresses the ambassador in a low voice.

"Aren't you glad that the guard captain interrupted you earlier, ambassador?" Eiden says. "Thanks to him, you didn't have to tell them about our little secret, and you all got to live to see another day! Be sure to make the most of your next few hours, ambassador. Life is short. You never know what might happen!"

"Yes... Creator," the ambassador says, in a very forced polite tone. "I thank you for your wisdom."   

We then hear him leaving the room, and a little later, so does Eiden. As the conversation ends, the king of the underground puts the metal cube back in his pocket and then he looks at us to see our reaction.

"Well?" the king of the underground says, after a few more seconds. "What did you think?"

 "I think the quality of the recording was very good."

"I think so as well," the king of the underground says. "We've invested a lot of money in these devices and I can say that I am very happy with them. Now, is there perhaps something else you would like to say to us aside from this?"

"Listen," Daren says. "I know this situation looks really bad, but I promise that we can fix it!"

"People are dying up there, healer," the king of the underground says, with a grave tone in his voice. "The guards are currently still wreaking havoc through the city, knocking down doors and killing anyone that dares to oppose them. We've evacuated the families of all the rebels from the surface already, but there is neither enough space nor air here in the underground to provide shelter for the entire population of the city. Even now there are people being murdered in their very homes because the king's men are still searching for you. These people would not have died if you hadn't entered this city. Their blood is on your hands."

"I understand, and I am truly sorry," Daren says. "I did not know that it would come to this. We thought that we would have more time before the arrival of the ambassador, and we did not fully consider the consequences of our actions. But we can still help. Our objectives remain the same, and they still align with yours. If we could organize ourselves to attack the king of Ollendor together, then maybe--"

 "I don't think you fully comprehend the position you are in, healer in armor," the king of the underground says. "The only reason why you haven't been captured by the royal guards yet is because we are providing you with shelter. Now, don't get me wrong, I am still very grateful for your efforts to find a cure for the sick people in our quarantine area. That is why I've allowed you to sleep here, despite what has been happening on the surface. However, I cannot in good conscience sacrifice the lives of the people from above just because there is a small chance for you to cure some of our terminally-ill inhabitants."

"The chance is not small at all!" Daren says. "Kelrim and I already have a very good lead as to what may be causing the disease, and if we get the herbs we need, we may even be able to heal those people as soon as today!"

"And once you are done healing the people from the quarantine zone, what will you do?" the king says. "Will you surrender yourself to the royal guards? Or do you perhaps have some other plan to end the senseless violence that is still occurring on the surface?"

"We will do what we came here to do," Daren says. "We will kill the king of Ollendor, and once he is dead, the madness should hopefully come to an end."

"You speak of killing the king when all of you combined could not even defeat two of his guards?!" Albert shouts. "Or have you already forgotten that we were the ones who risked our lives to save you from Gontrok and the royal guard captain yesterday?"

 Arraka laughs.

"He's got you there," she tells us.

"We've improved since then!" Hadrik says. "Just this morning, I practiced these new fighting techniques that will surely--"

"A few new moves are not going to help you when the captain will pin you all down to the ground with his aura!" Albert says.

"Wanna bet?" Hadrik says, with a grin.

"You arrogant little--" Albert starts to say, but the king interrupts him.

"Now, now, Albert," the king of the underground says, "we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss their efforts at self-improvement just because their claims seem unrealistic. I think it would be only fair to give them one final chance to prove themselves. If they fail our test, then we will put an end to our alliance and we will kindly ask them to leave our territory."

"If we fail the test, you're kicking us out for good?" Daren says. "Are you telling me that you won't even let us return to heal the sick people from the quarantine area?"

"If you will still want to save those people even under such circumstances, then we won't stop you from returning one last time to heal them," the king says. "However, you must understand that even in such a case, we will still ask you to leave as soon as you are done."

"Fine," Daren says. "I can accept that. So, I'm guessing that if we pass this test, you will fight together with us against the king of Ollendor?"

I think it would be only fair to give them one final chance to prove themselves. If they fail our test, then we will put an end to our alliance and we will kindly ask them to leave our territory."

"If we fail the test, you're kicking us out for good?" Daren says. "Are you telling me that you won't even let us return to heal the sick people from the quarantine area?"

"If you will still want to save those people even under such circumstances, then we won't stop you from returning one last time to heal them," the king says. "However, you must understand that even in such a case, we will still ask you to leave as soon as you are done."

"Fine," Daren says. "I can accept that. So, I'm guessing that if we pass this test, you will fight together with us against the king of Ollendor?"

 "That is likely what it will come down to, yes," the king of the underground says.

"So, what's this test going to be about?" Hadrik says. "Do you have some really strong fighters that you want us to beat?"

The king, Albert and Peter exchange a few looks before the king addresses us again.

"Yes, I suppose that would be one way to put it," the king says. "But first, let me ask you all a question. Have you not found it odd that someone as cautious as me would usually hold these meetings with so few of my own men to protect me?"

"I did find it a bit strange, now that you mention it," Daren says. "And what I'm finding even stranger is that you have even less security now than in our last two meetings. You used to have two guards by your side before, but now you only have Peter and Albert. Why did you avoid bringing your usual two guards if you knew that today's discussion might lead to a confrontation?"

"Oh, the answer to that question is quite simple," the king says. "It's because they would be in our way."

All of a sudden, an invisible force from above pushes us into the ground so hard that it breaks the wooden chairs we were sitting on into pieces. I try to get up, but due to the ridiculous amount of pressure that is pushing me against the floor, I can barely move a muscle. I eventually manage to turn my head a little, and I realize that all the others except Melindra and Leila are also lying on their backs just like me, unable to move. As I continue to lie there on the ground, trying to figure out what happened, I hear Arraka bursting into laughter.

 "Ahahahahahahaha!" Arraka laughs. "I was wondering when you'd finally reveal your hidden power to them, but this is just too much. I'm dying of laughter here. Ahahahahahaha!"

"What's the matter?" the king of the underground asks us, ignoring Arraka. "The test has already begun. This is the same aura manipulation technique that you were so proudly saying you could fight against as soon as you'd meet the royal guard captain again. Why don't you show me how much you've really improved?"

Is the king the one doing this to us? I didn't even know he was a mage! Damn it, if only I could move my arm so that I could at least throw my dagger at him or something...

"You can give up on the test at any time, you know," the king of the underground says, after some more time passes. "Just admit defeat, and I will let you get back up."

 "Untangle..." Daren says, in a barely audible voice, as he is still being pushed against the ground.

"I beg your pardon?" the king of the underground says.

"Untangle... the flow of the aura... with my mind," Daren says again, in a louder voice.

He then manages to pull out his sword from its hilt, using it to stab the air above him and then to make a quick slash to the right. As soon as he does this, the invisible force that was keeping us pinned down vanishes completely, and we all immediately get up, assuming our battle stances.

"There we go," Arraka says. "See? You can do it if you try."

 "Oh, now I understand!" the king says, as he looks at Daren. "You were imagining yourself untying an invisible knot with your sword just now, weren't you? Not bad! Alright, you've passed the first phase of the test. Albert, you are free to commence the second phase whenever you are ready."

"Yes, my king," Albert says, and a few seconds later he completely vanishes into thin air.

"What did he do?..." Hadrik says, as he looks around the room, trying to figure out where Albert disappeared. "Was that an invisibility spell?"

"It's more than just an invisibility spell," the king says. "What Albert is using right now is an ability that only the most skilled assassins can learn. He is completely concealing his presence. Not only is he not visible to you, but you also won't be able to hear him, smell him or even feel his aura. From your point of view, he may as well not be in this room at all."

"Oh, so it's similar to Eiden's invisibility spell, then," I say. "Arraka, I'm guessing you know where he is?"

 "Of course I know where he is," Arraka says. "But I'm not going to waste my time showing you his position just for some lousy mock battle. If you want to pass this lame test, figure it out yourselves."

"Well, no matter where he is," Hadrik says, "he's bound to come out of invisibility to attack us at some point, so I'll just wait for the right opportunity and grab him then. I can still grab people, right? It's not like I'm attacking him or anything, so the fact that he's a local shouldn't mat-- what the?!"

Hadrik suddenly tries to grab something from the empty air behind him, but nothing happens. When I try to understand what happened, I notice that Hadrik's leather armor has been pierced from behind, and that there is a bit of blood dripping from the upper side of his back.

"Did he seriously just attack me while he was still invisible?!" Hadrik says, as Peter is now moving towards one of the walls, in order to observe the fight better. "Since when do invisibility spells work like that?"

"I told you that it's more than just a spell," the king says. "His breathing, his aura control and his special orange-hilted dagger all play a role in helping him mask his presence. This is the result of years upon years of arduous training. You are taking assassins far too lightly if you think that you can simply wait for them to strike before you attack them. If this weren't a mock battle, getting backstabbed like that could have very well killed you, dwarf. Perhaps you should start taking this test a bit more seriously."

No matter how skilled Albert is, his feet still need to touch the ground when he is walking from one place to another. If I listen really carefully, maybe I'll be able to figure out where he'll strike next.

I attempt to focus on any sound that may resemble footsteps, blocking all other noises from my mind. Unfortunately, it seems that I might have underestimated the assassin's ability, because even with my Hearing stat maxed I simply cannot hear any sounds coming from the ground.

But what if I were to use the secret code that I know from Melindra in order to temporarily boost my Hearing stat? Would that be enough to hear him moving?

I quickly take out my stat device from my pocket and my crossbow from my backpack. I then insert the code that Melindra told me about and I immediately grab my crossbow with both hands, knowing that I only have a few seconds to react before the temporary stat boost wears off.

I can hear the steps now. They're barely audible even with this stat level, but I can hear them. I need to shoot him quickly, before the effect wears off. But I shouldn't hit him in a vital spot. He did his best not to kill Hadrik, after all.

 I quickly calculate his trajectory from the few steps I get to hear, and I try to anticipate his path as well as I can when I shoot my crossbow bolt at the empty air in front of me. To my surprise, instead of hitting him or passing through the air, the crossbow bolt clangs against a metal surface and it falls to the ground. Realizing that this was Albert deflecting the projectile with his dagger while still invisible, Hadrik wastes no time and he makes a quick dash towards the assassin, grabbing onto something that at first glance seems to be nothing more than empty air.

"Let go of me, damn it!" Albert says, as he is now slowly coming out of invisibility, revealing to us the fact that Hadrik had apparently grabbed him by his leg. "Let go of me, or I swear I will stab you for real this time!"

"Hey, all you have to do is 'admit defeat' and I'll let you go, friend!" Hadrik says, with a smirk. "There's no need to be so upset. It's only a friendly sparring match, after all!"

 All of a sudden, Peter extends his hands towards Hadrik and he shoots a powerful lightning attack out of his palms. As Hadrik is being shocked by the electrical current that is passing through his body, Albert tries to free himself, but the dwarf keeps holding onto him tightly and he doesn't let him escape.It seems that the assassin is not being affected at all by the electric attack, even if Hadrik is still holding him by the leg. Does this mean that he has some sort of item granting him immunity against electricity?

"You're... going to... have to do better than that!" Hadrik tells Peter, as he is holding back the pain from the electrical current. "Compared to the attacks of Kate's elementalist friend, this is like child's play!"    

"What the hell?" Daren says, as he turns towards the king of the underground. "Since when is Peter a part of the test? You never told us that he would be shooting lightning at-- NGH!"

As Daren was talking, Peter changed his mind and decided to target him instead of Hadrik, casting a lightning spell on Daren as soon as he exposed his back to him.

It looks like my bluff had an effect on him, because all of a sudden we hear several loud steps, as the assassin tries to quickly get away from the position in which he thinks I spotted him. Kate does not miss this opportunity and she shoots an icicle at him as fast as she can. Instead of hitting him, however, the icicle makes a loud clanging noise and it changes direction, falling to the ground.

It feels like I can detect some vague traces of his aura around the room, but it's very difficult to pinpoint their exact location.

As I look around the room some more, I realize that in a certain area where I've sensed Albert's aura, the miniscule specks of dust flying through the air are moving in an unnatural way. I would have never noticed this if I hadn't been focusing on this specific spot, but now that I've seen them, it should be easy enough for me to figure out in which direction the assassin is heading.

Shortly after Hadrik is done speaking, I feel a sharp pain coming from the right side of my abdomen, and when I look down I realize that I am already bleeding. I quickly put some pressure on the wound with my hand to stop the blood from coming out, but it hurts like hell, and it's making it very difficult for me to concentrate.

"Ah, crap!" Daren says. "Barry, hang on, I'm coming over!"

Before he even takes his first step towards me, we hear a stifled groan coming from Daren as he puts his hand on the back of his left knee, which is now beginning to bleed.

"What the hell, man?!" Daren shouts at Albert. "I was going to heal-- NGH!"

As he was finishing his sentence, Daren got blasted by a powerful bolt of lightning that made him drop to one knee. It looks like the spell came from Peter, who finally decided to join the battle as well.

While I stand there, thinking of what to do next, I suddenly get a premonition in which I see myself being stabbed in the right side of the abdomen by an invisible blade. I'm also pretty sure that Hadrik was about to say something right before I got attacked in the vision.

My attacker should be coming from the right side, so as long as I can figure out when exactly he will strike, I should be able to--

"What's the matter, Albert?" Hadrik asks all of a sudden. "Scared already?"

As soon as I hear Hadrik's words, I know exactly what will happen next, and I immediately turn to my right, extending my arms in front of me in order to grab onto Albert right before he attacks me. My attempt is successful, as the assassin is now slowly turning visible again, while trying to break free of my grasp.

"You'd better let go of me if you don't want to lose an arm," Albert says, in a menacing tone. "I'm warning you."

Damn it, I lost sight of him again. How is he still fine after getting shocked like that? Does he have some item that makes him immune against electric attacks?

"What the hell?" Daren says. "Since when is Peter a part of the test? You never told us that he would be shooting lightning at-- NGH!"

 "Surely you didn't think that you would only be fighting Albert in the second phase of the test, did you?" the king of the underground says. "Peter was obviously only giving you a head start. That is the only reason why he hadn't attacked you until now."

When Kate hears what the king had to say, she immediately conjures three ice cones out of thin air and she sends them flying towards him. Sadly, the icicles don't even get close to their target, as they are all easily deflected by an invisible force.

"A solid effort!" the king tells Kate. "But not good enough, I'm afraid."

Once again, the king pushes every one of us except Melindra and Leila into the ground with his invisible force, but this time he also uses his aura manipulation technique to twist Daren's right wrist until he lets go of his sword. The king then makes the sword float all the way to his position, and he grabs it in his hand.

"As Kate has already guessed, phase two was in fact a fight against Albert, Peter and me," the king of the underground says. "We weren't really expecting you to win, but we at least wanted to see how much of a fight you could put up. Unfortunately, even though you were able to undo my aura manipulation technique during the first phase, you weren't able to incapacitate a single one of us in the second part of the test, despite the fact that Peter and I left you plenty of time to do something about Albert. As a result, I am sad to say that you have failed our test."

 He then eases the pressure above us so that we can get back up.

"I expect to see you gone from our base as soon as you're done saying your goodbyes," the king says. "Unless of course you were speaking the truth about still wanting to heal the sick people from the quarantine area, in which case, you will of course be allowed to return one more time."

"I wasn't lying," Daren says, as he casts a quick healing spell on himself and then heads towards me to heal me as well. "I will heal all of those people."

"As you wish," the king of the underground says, and then he makes Daren's sword fly back into his hand. "Here is your sword. You might want to take better care of it from now on. What I personally recommend is that you learn some basic aura manipulation. It is easy to use on objects that you are very familiar with, and it would help you to retrieve your sword when it gets stolen from you again. Just keep practicing until you can make your sword fly back to your hand from at least fifty feet away. I'm sure that you'll get the hang of it eventually."

 He then eases the pressure above us so that we can get back up.

"Of course," the king of the underground says, and then he makes Daren's sword fly back into his hand. "Here is your sword. You might want to take better care of it from now on. What I personally recommend is that you learn some basic aura manipulation. It is easy to use on objects that you are very familiar with, and it would help you to retrieve your sword when it gets stolen from you again. Just keep practicing until you can make your sword fly back to your hand from at least fifty feet away. I'm sure that you'll get the hang of it eventually." 

"Huh," Daren says. "I never actually tried doing anything of the sort, but I guess it's worth a shot. Thanks."

}
 "If you don't mind me asking," Hadrik says, as he looks at the king, "how exactly did you come to learn a technique as obscure as aura manipulation? And how did you get so good at it?"

"He most likely learned it from the captain of the royal guards," Kate says. "Their techniques are much too similar for it to be a coincidence."

"Your friend is correct," the king of the underground tells Hadrik. "The current guard captain and I both used to serve as royal guards a long time ago, and he was the one who taught me everything I know regarding aura manipulation. Sadly, I couldn't convince him to come with me and help me form this underground kingdom when I left the royal guards some twenty-five years ago, so we are not exactly on friendly terms anymore nowadays. From what I've heard, he's still searching for pupils, but to this day he hasn't managed to find anyone else that was talented enough to learn anything beyond the most basic aura manipulation techniques."

"Well, that's definitely good news for us," Daren says. "We wouldn't have stood a chance against them if they had a whole army of skilled aura manipulators on their side."

"Indeed," the king of the underground says. "Now, I do not want to be rude, but Albert, Peter and I still have some things that we need to discuss in private in regards to our current refugee situation, so if you have any more questions, I would appreciate it if you could keep them brief."

 "Why did none of you attack Melindra and Leila during the test?"

"Well, Melindra invited you here specifically because she couldn't hurt locals herself," the king says, "so testing her would have been a little pointless, don't you think? And as for Leila, she is not one of the people that were involved in the murder of the Earl of Ollendor as far as I am aware, so we were never going to kick her out, especially since she's also the daughter of doctor Reidzek. Whether she wants to stay here or join you in the battle against the king of Ollendor is of course another matter altogether. Anyway, I believe you should all know the way to the teleporter room by now, so hopefully you'll forgive us for not escorting you on your way out. I bid you farewell!"

 "Why did you become a royal guard?"

"What can I say?" the king answers me. "There was a time when I used to be young and naive. Our schools are made in such a way that they brainwash you from a very young age into thinking that our kingdom is the greatest of them all, that the royalty is always working for the good of the people and that there could be no greater honor than to be a royal guard. My parents avoided telling me their true opinions about our kingdom out of fear that I might give them away to my school teachers by mistake, so I only found out how the world really worked after I began serving as a royal guard. This discovery was of course what led me to leave the royal guards at the age of twenty-nine and to form my very own little kingdom here, in these underground tunnels. Anyway, I hope this answer satisfied your curiosity. I believe you should all know the way to the teleporter room by now, so hopefully you'll forgive us for not escorting you on your way out. I bid you farewell!"

#if(v_b3_ch5_brief == 2) {
 "Do you and the royal guard captain have mage specializations aside from aura manipulation?"

"Not necessarily specializations, but we can use regular spells like other mages," the king of the underground says. "The captain of the guards likes to use his aura manipulation most of the time, because it's very effective and hard to counter, but he's been known to also use other types of spells whenever he felt like he was being cornered. We don't know exactly how many spells he can cast, so I recommend being careful when you fight with him, even if it feels like you are gaining the upper hand during a battle. Anyway, I hope this has answered your question. I believe you should all know the way to the teleporter room by now, so hopefully you'll forgive us for not escorting you on your way out. I bid you farewell!"

As far as I know, she was not involved in the murder of the Earl of Ollendor, so there is no reason for us to kick her out of our base, especially since she is also the daughter of doctor Reidzek. That being said, she can obviously still join you in the fight against the king of Ollendor, if that is her wish."

In short, we've noticed that the flying metal balls have stopped patrolling the skies at some point during the night. Most of them are now just hovering somewhere above the city, without moving at all from their positions. I've heard from Breynan that Billy Bob may have had a reason to deactivate the Overseer after finding out about his betrayal, but it is unclear to us if the deactivation actually took place, or if he's just trying to reprogram him to be more obedient. Either way, I would be careful if I were you. There's no telling what the lessathi is thinking."

 "So, did any of you guys know that the king of the underground and Peter were mages before they revealed their powers to us earlier?" Leila writes to us, as we walk further down the corridor. "I was honestly taken completely by surprise..."

"You could tell that they were mages if you looked closely at their auras, but I'll admit that the king's level of power surprised me a little as well," Melindra says. "I did not realize that he was suppressing the magic in his aura to such a degree."

"Let's hope that we won't need to fight them in the future," Daren says. "We've already got our hands full with the royal guards and the rest of the king's army as it is."

A few minutes later when we reach the waiting room, Daren tells us to wait for him while he goes to get Kelrim from the quarantine area. Meanwhile, Leila takes this opportunity to pay a quick visit to her father's workshop, so she can tell him where we're headed. As we are waiting for the two of them to return, Flower tries once again to begin a conversation with Illuna, although it looks like she's still being ignored.

 "Illuna, are you done learning that spell yet?" Flower says. "Illuna, come on... I need to talk to you about something. It's... It's about the way I've been acting lately... Hey, are you listening to me?"

"You still haven't talked to her yet?" I ask Flower.

"No!" Flower says. "I have no idea what she's doing! Even during that fight with the king of the underground and his men I could barely get her to pay attention."

"Okay, I found Kelrim!" Daren says in a loud voice, as he and the goblin are now walking out of the quarantine zone. "Are you all ready to go?"

"We're still waiting for Leila," I tell him. "She went to tell her father that we're going to the--"

"I'm back!" we see Leila's writing in front of us, as she is now running towards us. "We can go now."

"Have you been running this whole time?" I ask Leila when she gets closer. "You're sweating like crazy!"

"Considering that I have my speed stat maxed, I may as well be using it, right?" Leila writes, as she is still breathing a bit heavily. "Don't worry about me. I'll just rest while we walk."

 "Hey, I'm sure we can wait two more minutes for you to catch your breath!" I say. "Right, Daren?"

"Oh yeah, sure!" Daren says. "It's not a problem."

We decide to wait a few more minutes until Leila is good to go, and then we begin to head for the exit that leads towards the room with the teleporter. Just as we are about to make our first steps, we hear Flower's voice, as her eyes turn bright blue.

"Wait!" Illuna says, and we all stop in our tracks.

"Illuna?" Flower says. "Are you finally done practicing that spell?"

"I wouldn't say it's completely done, but at least I managed to get all the letters right," Illuna says."Step aside. I'm going to be conjuring a lot of plates."

Illuna then makes some gestures with her hands, and a large plate with a chocolate cake appears on the ground in front of us, along with several other small plates that are surrounding the larger plate and that each have a knife and a fork on top of them. There are a lot of unlit candles on top of the cake, and now that I take a better look at it, I see that there are also letters written on its surface with frosting. The letters spell 'Happy birthday Flower!'.

"I’m not as good as Flower at using the food creation spell so I needed a little time to make all the preparations, " Illuna says, "but I think that--"

 "Today is Flower's birthday?!" Kate asks, shocked, when she gets closer and reads the letters on the cake.

"Yes, that is what the writing on the cake says," Illuna answers her, bluntly.

"Flower, why didn't you tell us that it was your birthday today?" Kate says.

"Well, everyone had more important things to worry about, so I didn't really want to-- hold on a minute..." Flower says, as she gets close to the cake and then begins to count the candles one by one, using her index finger.

Once she is done counting them the first time, she starts to count them again but much slower, as if it was hard for her to believe what she was seeing.

"I-I-Illuna..." Flower says, in a trembling voice. "A-are there exactly thirty candles on top of this cake?"

"Of course there are," Illuna says. "You can still count, can't you?"

"D-does this mean what I think it means?" Flower says.

"No, this does not mean that I now consider you to be an adult," Illuna says. "And no matter how many times you will call me Illuna or act as if you were a grown-up, that is still not going to change. However... I've given this some more thought, and I've... arrived at the conclusion that I CAN make a concession and accept to call you a thirty-year-old, if it really means that much to you... It will still take a little bit of time getting used to the idea, but--"

Shortly after I'm done talking, we all begin to head for the exit that leads towards the room with the teleporter. Just as we are about to make our first steps, we hear Flower's voice, as her eyes turn bright blue.

"Wait!" Illuna says, and we all stop in our tracks.

"Illuna?" Flower says. "Are you finally done practicing that spell?"

"Well, I could have used a few more minutes to at least get all the letters right, but let's say it's mostly done," Illuna says. "Step aside. I'm going to be conjuring a lot of plates."

Illuna then makes some gestures with her hands, and a large plate with a chocolate cake appears on the ground in front of us, along with several other small plates that are surrounding the larger plate and that each have a knife and a fork on top of them.

"Happy 'birday' Flower?" Hadrik asks.

"It's obviously supposed to say 'birthday', but I already said that I didn't have time to--" Illuna says.

"Today is Flower's birthday?!" Kate asks, shocked.

"Yes, that's what the cake is for," Illuna says, mildly annoyed.

 "Flower, why didn't you tell us that it was your birthday today?" Kate says.

"Well, everyone had more important things to worry about, so I didn't really want to-- hold on a minute..." Flower says, as she gets close to the cake and then begins to count the candles one by one, using her index finger.

 "Oh Petal, thank you so much!" Flower says in a very loud voice, as she now looks like she is hugging herself.

"Can you at least control your body when you hug me inside your mind?" Illuna says. "Or do you not realize how ridiculous we both look right now?"

"I don't care!" Flower says, as she still continues to hug herself. "I don't want to let you go. I don't want to fight with you anymore. Please, please promise me that we won't ever have another fight like this for as long as we live! I swear that I won't try to act like someone I'm not anymore. I won't call you Illuna anymore. Just say that we will never have to go through something like this ever again!"

"We were not fight--" Illuna begins to say, but then she interrupts herself. "Ugh... fine, I give up... You win. I promise that we will never have a fight again. Are you happy now?"

"Yes!" Flower says, beaming, as she finally stops hugging herself. "You have no idea how happy! Thank you!"

She then comes closer to me and Melindra and she grabs our hands, as she smiles at us.

"And thank you both!" Flower says. "Thank you for all that you did for us!"

"That's not true!" Flower says. "You helped us a lot! You both did! Petal and I might have still been fighting today if it weren't for you! Thank you so much!"

"Ahem!" we hear Hadrik's voice, who is standing near the plates.

It looks like while the rest of us were busy talking, Hadrik used a tinderbox that he had in his backpack to light all of the candles on the cake.

"So, are you going to blow out these candles or what?" Hadrik asks Flower, as he is now holding the plate with the cake in his hands.

 "Yes!" Flower says, excited, as she runs towards the cake. "Yes, of course!"

She then leans forward and she blows on the candles as hard as she can, until none of them are burning anymore. After we all wish her a happy birthday, she begins to cut slices of the cake and to share them with everyone around.

 "Alright, I've served all the cake slices now," Flower tells us. "Let's get going!"

"Huh?" Hadrik says, confused. "But we're not done eating yet."

"You can finish eating while we walk!" Flower says. "Come on! I don't want anyone in the quarantine zone to die waiting for the cure because of me!"

"Fine, fine," Hadrik says. "Let's head for the teleporter, then."

We do what Flower says, and we take the small plates with us, as we walk towards the teleporter room. While we are travelling through the corridor, Hadrik pulls out a few very small mugs from his backpack with his free hand and he puts them on his plate, near the cake. He then takes out a bottle of dwarven ale and he begins to fill the mugs.

"Can't have a birthday without dwarven ale, right?" Hadrik says, and once he is done filling them up, he starts handing each of us a mug. "I've only poured a few sips' worth of ale for each of you. Wouldn't want you all to be getting drunk before a battle! Daren, I'm guessing that you're still not drinking during the day?"

"Of course not!" Daren says.

"Oh," Kelrim says, as he takes the plate with the slice of cake. "Thank you!"

"You're welcome!" Flower says, as she now looks at the rest of us and sees that we each have a plate in our hands. "Hmm... I think I know what to do with this last slice."

Flower conjures a small plate with a knife and fork and she puts the last slice of cake on it. She then goes over to the quarantine area entrance, and she extends her hands with the plate to Desmond, who is still guarding the door.

"It's my birthday!" Flower says, smiling, as Desmond looks at her confused.

"Oh..." Desmond says, as he grabs the plate from her hands. "Well, thanks, I guess..."

"Don't be too upset, Flower," Hadrik says, as he takes a sip from his mug. "You may not always be able to have everything you want in life, but that doesn't mean that you can't make the most of what you get! For example, you might not get to drink with us now, but just look at how many rocks are on the ground all around you. While the rest of us are busy with our drinking, you could be snatching up a rare rock that would put Melindra's collection to shame!"

"Nah," I tell Hadrik. "The rocks from here won't be any good for them. Half of them are too small, and the other half either don't have the right shades of colors or their surfaces are too smooth. I wouldn't be surprised if Melindra already got all the rocks that they would consider valuable the very first time when we walked through this tunnel."

 As all the others except Melindra are looking at me too shocked to speak, Flower lets out a loud gasp, while covering her mouth with both her hands.

"Hey, what do you know!" Melindra says, with a smug smile as she pats me hard on the back. "Looks like spending the entire night shift teaching you about rocks wasn't a wasted effort after all! We'll make a rock collector out of you yet!"

"I wouldn't count on it," I tell her.

"Oh my gods!" Flower says. "Barry actually learned to tell which types of rocks we like to collect. I can't believe it. This is the best birthday ever!"

We ended up spending the rest of the trip towards the teleporter room eating cake, drinking dwarven ale and helping Flower pick up a few rocks from the cave that she would use to start her very own collection. The time we got to celebrate Flower's birthday was short, but even so, it looked like she genuinely enjoyed it, and so did we. By the time we were done eating our cake, all of us were feeling completely refreshed, and we were now ready to begin the next chapter of our adventure.

 The 6th chapter of Book 3 is now available. Tap on the button at the bottom of this page to proceed.

----------------------------------------

Sorry for the long wait. The delay was caused by some health problems that I had back in November and December and by the extremely complicated path variation in this chapter. (the chapter has 10 achievements in total)

Hint: Some of the achievements in this chapter are on paths that can differ depending on how you interacted with the Overseer at the end of chapter 4 of book 3. There will also be other factors influencing the variation of the paths, like whether or not Rose is alive and whether you passed the king of the underground's test in the previous chapter or not.

Also, remember that every chapter in Magium can be finished without having any points invested in your stats, so if you find yourself unable to pass a stat check, try loading your last checkpoint and redoing some of your previous choices until you find the paths that require no stats.

Good luck!
