"Let me see if I got this straight..." Hadrik tells Meridith. "You people have been gathering a huge amount of energy from mages since the beginning of this tournament, all for the purpose of killing Eiden..."

"Yes," Meridith says.

"And if you don't manage to murder him by yourselves, you want us to be your backup plan," Hadrik says. "You want us to put him down like some dog, after you've left him weak and vulnerable. Is that what you're asking of us?"

"That is... not exactly how I would have phrased it, but in essence, you are correct," Meridith says, somewhat apprehensively.

"Do you have no honor?!" Hadrik says, while giving Meridith a look of pure disgust.

"Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding," Meridith says, in a slightly more nervous tone than before. "If you will allow me to explain one more time what we need from you, I'm sure we can reach some sort of agreement--"

"No, I think I've heard enough," Hadrik says, as he gets up from his chair.

 Fearing that Hadrik might try to attack her ally, Diane attempts to stand up as well, but Meridith puts her arm in front of her and stops her before she can get up on her feet.

"You and the rest of your lessathi underlings might be fine with using such underhanded tactics to defeat your enemies, but I will have no part in this," Hadrik says. "Find someone else to do your dirty work!"

He then turns away from us and storms out of the room, without looking back once.

"Hadrik! Hey, Hadrik, wait up!" Daren shouts, but he gets no response.

"I think I'd better go after him," Daren says, this time turning to Meridith. "The last thing we want is for him to get in some conflict with a lessathi from one of your opposing factions while he's still pissed off. I'll try to bring him back, if I can."

"There is no need," Meridith says, as she still seems to be collecting her thoughts after what just happened. "We will resume this meeting at a later time. I'm sure that you all have a lot to think about."

"Alright," Daren says. "We'll see you again later, then. Let me see if I can catch up to Hadrik in the meantime."

 "Hey, wait for us!" Flower says, as she and the rest of us are leaving our seats, so that we can follow Daren, who has already rushed out of the room. "We're coming too!"

"Actually, I would like to have a quick word in private with my nephew and Kate, if you all don't mind," Meridith says. "It will only take a few moments..."

Illuna and Melindra have both stopped in their tracks, and now they are looking at Meridith suspiciously. It looks like neither of them is very comfortable with the idea of leaving us alone with Meridith and Diane in the same room.

"It's fine," Kate tells Melindra and Illuna. "We'll be fine. You two go on ahead."

"Okay," Melindra says, as she nods her head. "Let's get going, then."

 She then leaves the room, together with Illuna, and then Meridith waits for a short while, to make sure that the others are no longer within hearing range of us, before she speaks again.

"I have a question for the two of you," Meridith says. "What would you say is your group's opinion on Eiden, exactly? Do your friends consider him a friend or a foe?"

"Isn't this maybe something that you should have considered asking before telling us to kill him?..." Kate says, confused.

"You're right," Meridith says. "I should have asked you this before, but I suppose that I never really considered the possibility that anyone could take that mass-murderer's side, except for maybe Melindra, who has known him for a very long time. However, your dwarf friend's reaction to my request has made me reconsider my position. Aside from his talk about honor, I felt that Hadrik might have a slight reluctance about killing Eiden, and I'm not sure if I understand why. Perhaps the two of you could enlighten me?"

"Is this why he gave you that message for me, then?" Meridith says. "Because he considers you his allies?"

"I highly doubt that Eiden considers any of us his allies," Kate says. "In my opinion, the only real reason why he hasn't killed us yet is that he doesn't consider himself threatened by us. However, this may change if he finds out that we've agreed to help you kill him."

"I see no reason why Eiden should find out that you struck a deal with me," Meridith says. "We are very far beneath the ground, surrounded by thick walls of seredium. Even someone like him couldn't possibly be spying on our conversation under these conditions."

"You are forgetting that Eiden can tell from our auras if we are lying to him or not," Kate says. "All it would take is for him to become slightly suspicious of us, and then he could easily learn about our secret plans just by asking us a few simple questions."

"...That is indeed a very good point," Meridith says, in a resigned tone. "Forgive me.

"I don't think anyone in our team trusts Eiden or considers him to be a friend," Kate says. "However, my opinion is that it would be a bad idea for us to antagonize him needlessly, while he is still not being hostile towards us. There is absolutely no way in which we could win against Eiden in our current state, if he decided to fight us at his full power."

"There is no need for you to openly antagonize him," Meridith says. "As long as you make sure to keep our plan a secret, you can continue to interact with him in the same way as you've done until now."

"Personally, I agree with Barry," Kate says. "Eiden may not have taken any hostile actions towards us recently, but that does not mean we can simply forget the fact that he almost murdered us on a whim a few times before. That being said, I also don't think that any of us would be thrilled at the prospect of antagonizing him needlessly, considering that he would almost certainly wipe us all out easily if he were to fight us at his full power."

 "What do you mean?" I ask her. "What kind of deal are you talking about?"

"The thing that I want the most from your group right now is for you to continue to participate in the mage tournament," Meridith says. "That way, at least I'll know that you'll still be here, in Varathia when we enact our plan. If you all agree to continue doing the tournament objectives so that the kings don't kick you out of the continent, then I will personally guarantee you access to our Magium node, as long as our plan works perfectly, and we manage to kill Eiden without your help. However, on the off-chance that Eiden survives, then you will have to decide for yourselves whether you are willing to kill him or not. In this scenario, you would obviously only gain access to the Magium node if you joined our side and killed Eiden, but for your safety, I won't ask you to make this decision until the very last moment. This way, even if Eiden were to ask you very specific questions about your meeting with me, you could answer him truthfully, without turning him into your enemy."

"Are you sure that you are okay with offering us such a deal?..." Kate says. "It honestly doesn't feel like you are getting a lot out of it."

"It does not cost me much to give your group access to our Magium node, but it will cost me everything if our plan to kill Eiden fails," Meridith says. "If making this offer to you raises our odds of success against Eiden by even the tiniest bit, then the deal is worth it for me." 

 "In that case, I think that most of our friends will likely accept your offer," Kate says. "Most of us were participating in the tournament without aiming to obtain the Magium anyway, so they shouldn't have any problems with the idea of continuing to complete the objectives."

"I hope you are right," Meridith says.

"So, I know this is a little off-topic," I say, "but you told me earlier that you knew the secret codes for unlocking the magical stats for my stat booster, and I was wondering if there's any chance that you could--"

"Of course, of course," Meridith says. "Just hand me the device, and I will input the code right away. Although, I have to warn you that these two stats will be working quite differently from the ones that you've been using until now."

"How so?" I ask.

TEXT:

 "You may not be aware of this, but the 'Magical power' and 'Magical knowledge' stats were in fact the first two stats that were implemented in these devices," Meridith says. "Back when these stat boosters were only prototypes, the lessathi who originally made them were aiming to use these devices to give themselves and the other members of our race the ability to cast magic. Unfortunately, after many years of failed experiments, they eventually found out that it was phisically impossible for pure lessathi to cast magic like a normal mage, and that the only ones who could properly use these stats were the half-lessathi. Realizing that the two magical stats were useless to them, the lessathi locked them behind a secret code, and then began to work on twelve new stats, which were fundamentally different in both purpose and design from the two original stats."

 "Why are they so different?" I say. "Isn't it still the basic principle of the device gathering energy from other mages and then converting that energy into points that can be used to augment different abilities?"

 "First of all, your understanding of how the stat boosters work is slightly incorrect," Meridith says. "While it is true that some of these stats are augmenting abilities that you already possess, such as your hearing, strength and speed, not all of your twelve stats work in the same way, as I'm sure you've already noticed. For example, the ancient languages and combat technique stats make it possible for you to access large amounts of information through your aura, but the amount of knowledge made available to you is limited by your current level in that stat, as a safety precaution so that your brain doesn't get overloaded by accident. Even though it may seem to you like the information is present in your head, you are in fact only accessing it by linking your aura to that of the stat device. This is also why you lose access to all of the information when the stat device is no longer connected to your aura."

"Oh, I think I get it now," I say. "So, what you're saying is that the only thing that these stats have in common is the energy source, but the way they work is in fact different for each stat. If I were to guess, I'd say that the stats which increase my physical attributes based on my own abilities are based on the ability enhancing spells that are already being used by generalists to augment their hearing, focus, reflexes, and so on, right?"

 "Precisely," Meridith says. "In other words, the lessathi who were working on these stat boosters gave up on the idea of using them to turn themselves into mages, and they began designing the devices as tools to cast magic for them, instead. Essentially, what they did with many of these twelve new stats was that they copied multiple existing spells and techniques that were already being used by mages, and they found ways to implement them so that they could be cast by the device itself, while its wielder had their aura linked to it. The same principle also applied to the three aura stats, which were based on skills and techniques that were most commonly used by mages who were reasonably proficient in aura manipulation."

"What about the premonition stat?" Kate asks. "I don't seem to recall any existing spells that can foresee the future..."

"The premonition stat was most likely developed by using knowledge that they obtained from one of the Magium nodes," Meridith says. "While it pains me to admit this, the lessathi of old were much more skilled at extracting information from Magium nodes than us, so I cannot confirm this theory, since it would be impossible for us to create devices of this complexity. However, what I do know is that the time weavers that are sent by the Magium possess the ability to see small glimpses of future events, so it is my assumption that the stat device must also be using a similar technique for its premonition stat."

 "So, getting back to our original discussion," I say, "what is it that makes the two magical stats so special compared to the other twelve stats? Do they have a different energy source, or something?"

"No, the energy is still being taken from mages, but the way it is used is entirely different from what you've come to expect," Meridith says. "Back when they first implemented the Magical power and Magical knowledge stats, there was no reason for the designers to implement a point investment system, because there were only two stats to upgrade, so the whole process could be done automatically by the device without any need for user input. The point system was only added after they created the other twelve stats, but by that time the two original stats were no longer being worked on, so they never got updated to the new system. In other words, you won't be able to use your existing points to upgrade the two magical stats, but as soon as I unlock them, they will start using the energy stored in the device to level up by themselves, and you won't be able to stop them."

"Hmm..." I say. "Does this mean that all of the energy collected from now on will be used only for these two stats? Will I not be getting points for my other stats anymore? And what about my existing points? Is there any danger that I might lose any of them?"

 "You can rest assured that your current points will not be affected by this change," Meridith says. "Once the energy stored in the device gets turned into points, it can only be used by your regular stats, and the magical stats will no longer have any access to that energy. However, while I am certain that you will still be receiving points in the future, the rate at which they will be given to you may become slower than before."

"Well, it can't be worse than it was in Ollendor, right?" I say. "I didn't get any points at all while I was in that city."

"Yes," Meridith says, "as long as you won't be in a city, you can still expect to get a reasonable amount of points to level up your other stats. We put the majority of our energy extractors near the cities of Varathia, because that was where we assumed most of the contestants would gather, initially. It was only after the kings told us that they wouldn't enforce a rule to prevent the tournament participants from killing each other that we started using teams of lessathi with mobile energy extractors to gather as much energy as we could from the mages scattered throughout the woods of Varathia. Diane was in fact busy escorting one such team when you first encountered her."

 "So, as long as I'm not in a city or near one of your energy extracting teams, it should be fine, then. Got it!" I say, as I take my stat booster out of my pocket and hand it to Meridith. "Here's my device. Do you need anything else to activate the stats, or--"

"No, just the device is enough," Meridith says, as she quickly presses several buttons in a row without even looking at the stat booster, and then she gives it back to me. "It is done. Your magical stats have been activated."

"That's it?..." I ask her, confused, as I take a good look at my device. "I can't say that I'm really... feeling any different."

"At the moment, your stat booster is busy converting its stored energy into levels for your new stats," Meridith says. "As soon as you will get your first level, your device should start beeping to let you know that your magical stats are ready."

"Won't the energy from the device run out much faster now that Barry will use it to cast spells?" Kate says. "How will there be enough of it left to level up any of his stats?"

 "The energy collected from the tournament participants is not being used to cast spells," Meridith says. "It is only used to level up the stats. The magical stats are made in such a way that they give Barry the ability to draw energy from the magical plane by himself to cast his spells, similarly to how all other mages do it. This is the main reason why pure lessathi were never able to use these stats. Since our auras are completely devoid of any magic whatsoever, it is impossible for us to cast spells in the same way as regular mages, no matter how well we construct our devices."

"If the device allows me to draw energy from the magical plane," I say, "then could it be possible for me to feed the device energy by myself instead of relying on what the stat booster extracts from other mages around me? I know for a fact that there are certain tools which can help mages power up devices with magical energy. I've seen them used before!"

"Feeding energy directly into the device is very inefficient and wasteful," Meridith says. "If the magical energy is not properly extracted from the auras of other mages, then it will be expended by the device far too fast to be of any real use to you in the long term. You should already know this, since you told me that you've used Emergency Mode in the past. Come to think of it... I never did ask you how exactly you managed to activate this mode before. I can think of very few situations in which the Emergency Mode would activate by itself, and none of them seem very likely. Did you perhaps find some way to activate it manually?"

"Oh... I think I understand now," Meridith says. "Their high amount of energy must have been too much for their auras to fully absorb, so it was leaking out, which triggered the emergency mode prompt. Is that what happened?"

"Yes, exactly!" I say.

 "Do you have any idea if there are other ways in which we could activate this Emergency Mode on command?" Kate says. "Like for example, if we all tried to transfer our magical energy into the device at the same time, could that perhaps trigger it?"

"We were being attacked by Tyrath, the king of dragons," I say. "He was almost about to kill us when Eiden froze the time and gave me those powers, in order to even the odds."

"Ah... that makes more sense," Meridith says. "Of course he would have something to gain from helping you defeat one of his strongest enemies. But still, if what you say is true, then it is possible that Eiden's aura signature is still imprinted on your device. Can you hand it over to me again just for a few seconds so I can check?"

"Sure," I say, and then I give her the device once more.

As soon as she receives it, Meridith uses her wand to touch the stat booster, and not long afterwards a blue light begins to radiate from my device, only for it to turn back to normal a few seconds later.

"Just as I thought..." Meridith says. "Your device has recorded Eiden's aura as a potential source of energy for emergency situations. This means that whenever Eiden is close by, you should be able to activate the emergency mode by simply pressing this button three times in quick succession."

"Wow, that's amazing!" I say, as I take my device back and put it in my pocket. "So, does this mean I can just steal all of his energy with my device now, and he won't be able to do anything about it?"

 "No," Meridith says. "As soon as he realizes what you are doing, Eiden will likely only need a few seconds to block your stat booster's ability to absorb his energy, and then you will never be able to use this method against him again. However, since this is a very obscure feature of the device, I highly doubt that Eiden knows about it, so at the very least it should take him by surprise. You likely won't be getting much of a boost to your levels, and you won't have time to cast more than one or two spells, but even so, having such an ace up your sleeve could still mean the difference between life and death, if you ever need to fight Eiden head on."

"Hmm..." I say. "You might be right. I suppose it's good to have something like this as a last resort, for the worst case scenario. Thanks for letting me know about this!"

"You're welcome," Meridith says.

 "You'd need ridiculous amounts of energy to be transferred very fast into the device, to even have a slight chance of activating this mode," Meridith says. "Realistically speaking, stillwaters are the only kinds of mages who possess such high quantities of energy, but as far as I know, Melindra does not have full control over her powers, so she would never be able to do something as complex as transferring her energy willingly into the device. If the rest of you were to try activating the device with your levels of energy, you'd likely only be wasting your time."

"I see," Kate says.

"Diane, you've been very quiet ever since you came back from the surface," Meridith tells Diane, looking genuinely concerned. "Is anything wrong?"

"Umm, no, lady Meridith," Diane says, looking a little flustered. "It's just that I knew how important this meeting was to you, and I didn't want to interrupt."

"There's no need for you to worry about that," Meridith says. "You can say whatever's on your mind. You know that I've always valued your opinion."

 "Very well," Meridith says. "At any rate, I think our dicussion here is done for the moment. We should probably go looking for Daren and the rest of your group. Let's hope that they didn't get into any trouble."

We all do as Meridith said and get up from our seats, as she leads us out of the meeting room and back into the corridor filled with blue crystals. As we are once again passing by the secret door behind which the Magium node can be found, an idea suddenly pops into my head, and without thinking I ask Meridith a question.

"Hey, Meridith, there's something that I've been wondering," I say, as we are now moving away from the Magium node. "You said that you'd be willing to give us access to the Magium node, but what does that mean, exactly? How are we supposed to interact with it?"

"There are certain tools that our people have developed along the years, which make it possible to extract information from the node," Meridith says. "It is a very lenghty process, but also a very rewarding one. The Magium contains knowledge far beyond what you could ever imagine. This wand that I'm carrying, for example, could not have been built without information that I've personally managed to extract from the Magium node. Many of our other devices were also made in the same way."

 "So, the only method for us to access the information contained in the Magium is to use your tools, then?" Kate asks. "There is no other way?"

"There are other ways, of course, but I wouldn't recommend them," Meridith says. "You could, for example link your aura directly to the node, in order to enter the Magium realm. This would grant you a far more direct way to extract the knowledge that you want, but it would also be much more risky. One small mistake, and you could get lost in the Magium realm forever, with no way to get back to our world. Meanwhile, from our point of view, you would be stuck in a trance with yellow glowing eyes for the rest of your life, until you'd finally die of thirst or starvation."

Linking your aura directly to the Magium, huh?... I'm pretty sure that this is the technique which Arraka used when we went to the Magium's realm to watch everyone's trials during the God of Time's ritual. I wonder if I could learn how to do that in the future... 

"But what if you were to touch the node for a longer period of time?" Kate asks. "Do you know what would happen then?"

 "Unfortunately, I do," Meridith says, in a sad tone of voice. "Every year or so, we get at least one lessathi who manages to sneak past the security and find his way to the Magium node, just so he could try to touch it. Sadly, almost every single one of them has gone completely insane. After they touch the node, most of them refuse to talk, they refuse to eat or drink, they just want to stay there and stare at the node, and they react very violently if you try to take them away from it. We've found no way to bring them back to their senses, and they usually end up dying from thirst, a few days afterwards."

"You're telling me that you knew how dangerous this Magium node was, and you left us alone with it, without so much as a warning?..." Kate asks, perplexed.

"I... didn't think that a warning would be necessary," Meridith says. "Lessathi are by their nature being drawn to the Magium node, which is why we need to keep them as far away from it as possible, but none of the other races have ever manifested any sort of attraction to these nodes. Not even half-lessathi. Why would you ever try to touch such a dangerous-looking thing if you weren't compelled to do so by your very nature?"

 "Maybe you should ask Barry that question," Kate says. "He already touched the node once, before we came to your meeting room."

"He touched the node?!" Meridith says, in a panicked tone of voice. "But how is he still here? Why has he not gone mad? I don't understand!"

"I only touched it for a brief moment," I say. "I immediately realized that the information I was receiving was too much for my brain to handle, so I removed my hand as fast as I could, to avoid becoming insane."

"You managed to resist the temptation of infinite knowledge and to make the conscious decision of removing your hand from the node in just one second?..." Meridith asks, looking even more confused than before. "But... if you were the type of person to be capable of such an incredible amount of self-control, why would you do something as stupid as touching the node in the first place? I don't understand... It feels like the more I learn about you, the less I actually know."

 "There's no need to think about it too much," Kate says. "This is how Barry has always been. From what I've seen of him so far, and from what I've heard of his past, he likes to constantly throw himself into situations where a mere split-second decision could lead to his death, or worse. Statistically speaking, it would be impossible for him to have survived for so long relying only upon luck, so the only logical conclusion I can draw from this is that he must have developed some sort of superhuman ability to almost always make the right decision in conditions of extreme stress. I say 'almost always', because there have also been situations where these decisions of his didn't exactly work out, so in the end he had to be saved by dumb luck."

"Barry's survival instincts don't work," Kate says. "Do you think he would have tried to join a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world without even being a mage otherwise?"

 "I... suppose not," Meridith says.

"Hey, I did decide not to touch it in the end!" I say. "Even I have my limits. At the end of the day, it seems like I made the right decision."

"So, do any of you have any idea which way your friends might have gone?"  Diane asks us. "The seredium walls are making it pretty much impossible for us to detect their auras."

 "If I'm not mistaken," Kate says, "we already went past the secret tunnel entrance that we used to get here, and I don't think Hadrik could have opened it without smashing through the wall. This means that he must have kept going further down this corridor."

"Yes, I think so as well," Meridith says. "There are only two ways out of this area, aside from the secret tunnel, but the problem is that one of those routes leads straight into Heksol faction territory. Maybe we should check that tunnel first, just to be safe."

"Isn't the entrance to that corridor clearly marked as leading to the Heksol faction area, in the common language?" Diane says. "Surely, the dwarf must have read that and decided to take the other path, right?"

"Don't worry," I say. "It's Hadrik we're talking about. Even if he were to meet someone from the Heksol faction, he'd likely just offer them some dwarven ale, and they'd both be friends by now."

"I hope you are right," Meridith says.

As we get closer to the place where the path splits into two, I suddenly hear Hadrik's laugh echoing in the distance.

"Hahahaha!" Hadrik says. "You know, for a 'Heksol faction' guy you're not so bad. Here, have another drink!"

"I'm still keeping my eye, on you, you know," I hear another voice, who I'm assuming is the lessathi from the Heksol faction. "Don't think you can sweet-talk me just by pouring me a few glasses of-- hey, this ale doesn't taste like the first one. Do you have different kinds of dwarven ale in these bottles?"

 "My friend, you have good taste!" Hadrik says. "There's a very subtle difference, but this particular ale does indeed have a higher quality than the others. Hey, this gives me an idea! I'll give you three bottles of dwarven ale to taste, and if you can correctly identify which one is the most expensive, I'll let you keep all three, free of charge! How does that sound?"

"Bring it on, dwarf," the lessathi says. "If there's one thing I'm fully confident in, it's my ability to recognize good alcohol."

"Hah!" Hadrik says. "I was hoping you'd say that!"

Huh... I guess I was wrong about the direction in which Hadrik went. From what I just heard, it sounded like he was somewhere in the Heksol faction area. 

As I look around me, I see that nobody is reacting in any way, which means that I must be the only one who was able to hear Hadrik, thanks to my hearing stat. Maybe I should tell the others about this?

We keep walking for a little while until we reach the path split, and then we head through the tunnel on the left, which apparently seems to be leading towards the main quarters of the lessathi base, according to the markings on the walls.

After a few more twists and turns, we finally reach Daren, Flower and Melindra, who seem to be in the middle of a heated argument with the lessathi guard that is tasked with protecting the tunnel from intruders.

"Listen, man," Daren says in a loud voice, as he seems to be losing his temper. "I don't have time for your stupid riddles. I'm going to ask you for the last time. Did you or did you not see a dwarf passing through here before we came by?"

 "I already told you that there may or may not have been a dwarf passing through here, and that you're not going to get more information than that out of me," the guard says. "It is not my duty to inform you of all the people who cross through the tunnel. However, if there was such a dwarf, then clearly he must have had his paperwork in order, because otherwise he would have been stuck here with the rest of you fine folk. Now, then, are you going to show me your entry papers, or am I going to have to escort you all to our nice and warm prison cells?"

"What part of us being Meridith's guests did you not understand?!" Daren says. "How do you even think we could have gotten in here, if not by using her teleporter?"

"Lady Meridith is not the only one with access to the teleporter," the guard says. "There have been other attempts to smuggle immigrants from the surface without requesting proper permissions from the authorities in the past, and they all had stories similar to yours."

"Then why don't you ask her yourself, smart-ass?" Daren says. "She only just entered the tunnel!"

"Lady Meridith!" the guard says, as he takes a courteous bow. "I did not know that you'd be visiting the Creator today. I will be with you in a moment. I was just dealing with these lying trespassers who are claiming that--"

"Yes, yes, I've heard you talking to them," Meridith says. "They are not liars. They are indeed my guests, and the same goes for the dwarf. Tell me, did you actually see the dwarf they were asking about, or did he in fact not come this way at all?"

 "I'm afraid that I did not meet any dwarf today, Lady Meridith," the guard says. "Would you like me to form a search party to look for him?"

Meridith sighs.

"No, that will not be necessary," she says. "There were only two ways he could have gone, and if he's not here, then this means that he must have passed through the Heksol faction tunnel, as I suspected. Can you please release these humans from your custody so that we can go look for him together?"

"Umm, yes, of course..." the guard says. "They are free to go. But next time when you invite guests to the underground, could you please go through the proper channels? For some reason, I was never informed of their arrival..."

"Certainly," Meridith says. "I will make sure that the information properly reaches all the concerned parties next time. Let us go."

As Daren and Melindra walk over to us, Flower frowns and sticks her tongue out at the lessathi guard before she turns around to join us as well.

 I choose to not tell anyone anything about what I just heard. Hadrik seemed to be on somewhat friendly terms with that lessathi guy, so I don't think there's any harm in letting them have a few more drinks before we interrupt them.

Just as we were about to leave, I notice that a small area from one of the tunnel walls looks slightly out of place, compared to the rest of the black seredium surface. For some reason, this bothers me, so I walk closer to it, so that I can get a better look.

"Barry, what's going on?" Daren asks me. "Why did you stop?"

"I don't know how to explain this to you, but something about this wall doesn't feel natural to me," I say, as I touch its surface, to see if I can notice a difference in texture compared to the other seredium rocks. "Could this particular tunnel be man-made, by any chance?"

"It is definitely possible," Meridith says. "These tunnels were here since long before any of us were born, so none of us know exactly how they were created. I don't really understand why that's relevant, though..."

"You see," I say, "the thing is that there is this lessathi architect from the old times who left a bunch of puzzle pieces in all the places that he built, and I was wondering if this wasn't by any chance one of them, considering how this is the main lessathi base of operations. Of all the walls in this place, this looks the most suspicious to me, but I can't quite tell why, exactly. Melindra, Flower, you are the rock experts around here. Could you maybe have a quick look?"

 "We really don't have time for this..." Meridith says. "For all we know, your dwarf friend could have already gotten in a drunken brawl with some of the lessathi from the Heksol faction, and if I'm not there to stop it, who knows what--"

"I'm sure Hadrik is fine," I tell her, as Melindra comes closer and also starts examining the wall. "What do you say, Melindra? Are you noticing anything peculiar?"

"You're definitely right that this place was lessathi-made, by the looks of it," Melindra says, "but I'm not so sure about the puzzle piece. At the very least, I'm not noticing any obvious mechanism that could cause the wall to open. Flower, what do you think?"

"Well, there are a few secret knock codes that I've used in other ruins in the past to open secret corridors before," Flower says. "I could try some of those."

"You can't be serious..." Meridith says. "This is going to take forever!"

"No, no, it will be really quick, watch!" Flower says, and then she starts knocking on the wall several times, with some pauses in-between the knocks, to see if there's any reaction. "Okay, that was two of the codes. Three more to go!"

 As soon as Flower finishes the third code, the peculiar-looking rock begins to slide inside the wall by itself, and then it moves to the side, so that a gray stone with writing on it can take its place, leaving just enough space between the stone and the rest of the wall for a small object to be able to fit through. The words on the stone are written in the common language, and they are saying: 'If you like discovering secrets, place your palm upon this rock.'

All of a sudden, I hear Flower gasping, as she is also done reading the writing on the rocky surface.

"Barry, I think you were right!" she says. "This really does feel like the work of that lessathi architect again! Hold on, let me check!"

She then places her palm on the rock, like the writing said, and a puzzle piece immediately gets thrown out of the hole below the stone, along with a small parchement with text on it that is also written in the common language, saying: 'Find all of the pieces of the puzzle, and I will share with you my greatest secret. I've left one of these in each of the buildings I've designed.'

"Barry, what are you waiting for?" Flower tells me. "Put your palm on the stone, quick! Before it slides back into the wall!"

 I put my palm on the stone, like Flower asked, and then I get the same puzzle piece and message as her. Shortly afterwards, the gray stone with the writing goes back inside the wall by itself, making way for the initial rock to take its place once again.

"Was that it?" Meridith asks us. "Are you ready to go, now?"

"Yeah, sorry for the hold-up," I say. "We're done here."

"Then let us be on our way," Meridith says. "With a little luck, maybe Hadrik was stopped by the person guarding the tunnel, and he didn't actually manage to enter the Heksol faction's territory."

Once we leave the lessathi guard behind, it doesn't take us long to reach the entrance of the tunnel, and then to go through the other corridor, in order to head towards the main quarters of Meridith's opposing faction.

A few minutes later, we suddenly hear Hadrik's loud laughter, as he seems to be having a spirited conversation with someone who I'm assuming to be a lessathi guard from the Heksol faction.

"I have to say, it sounds like your dwarf friend and I could have really gotten along," Hadrik says. "It's too bad that I couldn't meet him while he was still alive."

 "Oh, it's fine," I say. "I don't need the puzzle piece. I only pointed it out because I knew you were collecting them."

"Really?" Flower says, surprised. "Well, in that case, thanks a lot, Barry! I owe you one!"

"Don't mention it," I say, as the stones in the wall are now switching back to their original positions, hiding the puzzle piece dispenser from any new passerbies.

"Was that it?" Meridith asks us. "Are you ready to go, now?"

"Yeah, sorry for the hold-up," I say. "We're done here."

"Then let us be on our way," Meridith says. "With a little luck, maybe Hadrik was stopped by the person guarding the tunnel, and he didn't actually manage to enter the Heksol faction's territory."

 "Yes, well at least he had a death worthy of a dwarf," the Heksol faction guard says. "He picked a fight with the wrong people while he was dead drunk, and he got stabbed in the chest. The way I heard it, he managed to take four of them down with him too, before he croaked. He always used to tell me that a drunken brawl would be the best possible way for him to leave this world, so I guess he finally got his wish."

"Hey, would you look at that..." Hadrik says, with a grin, as we turn the corner and get a direct line of sight towards the dwarf and his new friend. "If it isn't the big boss herself! Well, what are you just standing there, for? Come here. Sit with us. Have a drink!"

Taking a good look around Hadrik and the lessathi guard, I see that they are surrounded by dwarven ale bottles, of which a few have already been emptied. It seems that they've been drinking for quite a while.

"I'm afraid that I'll have to refuse your offer," Meridith says. "I have a few important meetings to attend after this, which will require me to remain sober." 

"Is she always like this?" Hadrik asks the lessathi guard, as he pours him another glass of ale.

"All the time," the lessathi guard says, and then he takes a sip from his filled glass.

"Damn it, Hadrik," Daren says. "Do you have any idea how much trouble we went through while we were trying to find you? Some guard from the other tunnel wouldn't let us leave, and he even wanted to send us to their prison!"

 "Hey, it's not my fault that you guys look so suspicious!" Hadrik says, as he takes another sip from his glass. "I mean, look at me. I ran into a guard too, and he's not trying to have me arrested, is he?"

"Don't give me any ideas, dwarf," the lessathi guard says, jokingly, as he and Hadrik both laugh and then clink their glasses before having another drink.

"Ugh..." Daren says, in an annoyed tone.

"So, what is it that brings you here, 'lady' Meridith?" the lessathi guard says, in a disdainful tone, once he is done with his ale. "It has been some time since I've been 'honored' with your presence."

"Spare me your sarcasm, Kleykarth," Meridith says. "I only came here because I was worried that my dwarf guest might get into a fight with someone from your faction. It seems, however, that my concern was unwarranted."

"From what I heard, the dwarf would have had much more of a reason to pick a fight with you than with us, 'lady' Meridith," Kleykarth says. "In fact, he had quite a few choice words to say about you after his first few glasses of ale. Would you like to hear some of them?"

"I would be quite interested, yes..." Meridith says, while giving Hadrik a cursory glance.

"Now, now, that won't be necessary!" Hadrik says, as he puts a hand on the lessathi guard's shoulder.

"Hahahah!" Kleykarth laughs. "I was just messing with you, dwarf. There's no need for you to panic. Your secrets are safe with me!"

Either way, it sounded like Hadrik did in fact go to the Heksol faction area, just like I thought, so at least now I know that we're headed in the right direction.

We keep walking for a little while until we reach the path split, and then we head through the tunnel on the right, which apparently seems to be leading towards the Heksol faction's territory, according to the markings on the walls.

A few minutes later, we suddenly hear Hadrik's loud laughter, as he seems to have just finished the drinking contest that he was talking about earlier.

 "You're damn right, I did!" says the Heksol faction guard. "Did you really think that serving me two bottles of completely identical ale alongside a third bottle with a nearly indistinguishable difference in taste would somehow throw me off my game? I'll have you know that I used to be friends with a dwarf who was ten times the drinker you are. If he were still with us today, he would have drunk you under the table in a matter of minutes."

"I'm sure he would have," Hadrik says, as we are getting closer to him, and now see that he is holding a glass of ale in his hand, while raising it high. "Let us have a toast in his honor, then. May he always watch over us from above, with a bottle of dwarven ale in his hand, and a big drunken smile on his face!"

"Dwarf," the guard says, "this may be the first respectable thing you've said since we met."

The two of them now clink their glasses and then they have a good long drink, before they finally notice us.

"I'm afraid that I'll have to refuse your offer," Meridith says. "I have a few important meetings to attend after this, which will require me to remain sober." 

"Is she always like this?" Hadrik asks the lessathi guard, as he pours him another glass of ale.

"All the time," the lessathi guard says, and then he takes a sip from his filled glass.

 "Okay, I take back what I said earlier about Hadrik," I say. "I just overheard him talking to someone from the Heksol faction, so he's most likely somewhere in the Heksol faction area right now."

"I knew it..." Meridith says. "Let's hurry up, then. The last thing I want is for these people to gain new reasons to antagonize me."

"Actually, from what I heard, it sounded more like they were having fun with a drinking contest," I say.

"Huh..." Meridith says, a little surprised. "Well, either way, we can't let them interact for too long. Who knows what could happen if they get too drunk. Follow me."

We keep walking for a little while until we reach the path split, and then we head through the tunnel on the right, which apparently seems to be leading towards the Heksol faction's territory, according to the markings on the walls.

A few minutes later, we suddenly hear Hadrik's loud laughter, as he seems to have just finished the drinking contest that he was talking about earlier.

 "You've beaten me fair and square!" Hadrik says, loudly. "Here is your reward! You've most certainly earned it!"

 "You're damn right, I did!" says the Heksol faction guard. "Did you really think that serving me two bottles of completely identical ale alongside a third bottle with a nearly indistinguishable difference in taste would somehow throw me off my game? I'll have you know that I used to be friends with a dwarf who was ten times the drinker you are. If he were still with us today, he would have drunk you under the table in a matter of minutes."

"I'm sure he would have," Hadrik says, as we are getting closer to him, and now see that he is holding a glass of ale in his hand, while raising it high. "Let us have a toast in his honor, then. May he always watch over us from above, with a bottle of dwarven ale in his hand, and a big drunken smile on his face!"

"Dwarf," the guard says, "this may be the first respectable thing you've said since we met."

The two of them now clink their glasses and then they have a good long drink, before they finally notice us.

"Well, if it isn't the big boss herself!" Hadrik says, with a grin. "What are you just standing there, for? Come here. Sit with us. Have a drink!"

 "...What exactly were you two doing here?" Kate asks Hadrik, as she sees three bottles of dwarven ale lined up next to each other.

"Oh, we were having a little drinking contest," Hadrik says. "I asked this fine fellow, here, to order these bottles according to their prices, from highest to lowest, after having only one sip from each of them, and he passed my test with flying colors. Would you like to give it a try? I happen to have a few more bottles here that I'd love to--"

"Umm, no thanks," Kate says. "I was just curious, that's all."

"So, what is it that brings you here, 'lady' Meridith?" the lessathi guard says, in a disdainful tone. "It has been some time since I've been 'honored' with your presence."

 "Spare me your sarcasm, Kleykarth," Meridith says. "I only came here because I was worried that my dwarf guest might get into a fight with someone from your faction. It seems, however, that my concern was unwarranted."

"From what I heard, the dwarf would have had much more of a reason to pick a fight with you than with us, 'lady' Meridith," Kleykarth says. "In fact, he had quite a few choice words to say about you after his first few glasses of ale. Would you like to hear some of them?"

"I would be quite interested, yes..." Meridith says, while giving Hadrik a cursory glance.

"Now, now, that won't be necessary!" Hadrik says, as he puts a hand on the lessathi guard's shoulder.

"Hahahah!" Kleykarth laughs. "I was just messing with you, dwarf. There's no need for you to panic. Your secrets are safe with me!"

 "Phew!" Hadrik says, as he leans back and drinks some more ale. "You actually had me worried, there, for a second."

"Did I hear this right?..." we hear a voice coming from the darker parts of the tunnel. "There are insulting words that even a drunken dwarf is too ashamed to share with others? Now I'm getting curious to know what they are as well..."

"So, you've finally decided to come out of your hiding place, aye?" Hadrik says, while looking at the man coming out of the darkness, as he pulls out a third glass from his backpack and starts filling it with ale. "You know, I've been calling out to you for ages, but you never answered. You can have a seat with us, if you want!"

"That won't be necessary!" the man says. "I am more than happy to stand."

When we get a closer look at the man coming out of the shadows, we see that he is wearing a boot on his head and socks on his hands, while having a whole bunch of unintelligible gibberish written on his shirt and pants, which surprisingly, are at least worn correctly. He is also walking barefoot, but considering that Flower has been doing the same thing since we've met her, that doesn't really seem all that weird to me anymore.

 "You say that you want us to tell you about the insults," Kleykarth says, "but you weren't that far away from us when the dwarf said them. Surely you must have heard at least some of the words?"

"Unfortunately, I was in a trance at the time, so I couldn't hear anything of what you two were saying," says the man with the boot on his head. "My apologies, good sir!"

"A trance?..." Hadrik asks, confused. "What are you, some kind of a shaman, or something?"

"No, no, nothing of the sort," says the man with the boot on his head. "I was simply trying to get in the right state of mind to communicate with our Creator. He speaks to me, from time to time... Although, admittedly, it has become harder lately to separate his actual words spoken to me from my own delusions."

"Don't try to take him too seriously,"Kleykarth tells Hadrik. "The poor guy's gone mad ever since he touched the Magium node a few months ago. He's been pretty much speaking in riddles ever since."

 "Not all of my words are riddles, my good man..." the crazy guy says. "Also, don't you think you are being rather rude to our guest? You've been speaking so loudly the whole time, that the poor fellow hasn't had the courage to utter a single word until this moment. Come now, friend, will you not do us the honor of joining our conversation? I promise that despite their looks, these are quite respectable folk, and they won't make fun of your unusual appearance!"

As he speaks, the crazy guy seems to be looking directly at one of the blue crystals from the ceiling.

"What's the matter, Uverg?" Kleykarth says, mockingly. "Is your invisible fairy friend from the ceiling too shy to talk to us?"

"I do not think that he is a fairy..." Uverg says, looking as if he didn't quite catch on to the lessathi guard's sarcastic tone. "Fairies would usually not use these crystals to transfer their consciousness into them, don't you think?"

"The Overseer protocol?..." Meridith asks. "Why does that name sound familiar?"

 "Oh, right," Meridith says, "I do remember hearing a long time ago that Biliborrathrathsarran had reactivated some highly intelligent machine built by the lessathi of old, but I didn't know all the details. Unfortunately, we haven't really been getting a lot of information from inside Ollendor these past few years, since it has been much too dangerous to keep any spies inside that city. But how would a machine be able to transfer its consciousness into the crystals? Does it even have a consciousness to begin with?"

"From what we've been told," Kate says, "the lessathi who built the Overseer also created a manufactured soul for him, in order to give him free will. However, the reason why he is able to navigate through these crystals is because he was controlled by the Magium for a brief period of time, and he has managed to retain some of the knowledge that he had access to during those few minutes."

"The Overseer came into contact with the Creator?" Meridith says. "Fascinating..."

"Hey, you there, in the blue crystal!" Diane says, while looking at the ceiling. "If this question isn't too vague for you, would you mind telling us for how long you've been spying on us?"

"The crystals alerted me as soon as your guests were teleported to the underground, which is also when I began to follow you," the Overseer says.

"You've been following us since we came back from the surface?!" Diane says, shocked. "So... you've also been listening to our private conversation in the meeting room?"

 "Affirmative," the Overseer says. "However, it should be stated that your plans regarding the stillwater called Eiden are of little interest to me. My main focus is currently on unlocking the secrets of these blue crystals, as well as those of the Magium itself, and I believe that your Magium node will greatly help me to expedite my research on these topics."

"You think you can just use our Magium node without our permission?" Meridith says, in a menacing tone.

"That is correct," the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol considers your permission to be largely irrelevant, since you have no realistic means of blocking my access to your node. If you think that my assessment of the situation is incorrect, feel free to provide your feedback to one of the green-eyed units, and we will investigate the matter as soon as possible. Remember, your feedback always matters!"

"Is he--" Meredith turns to me, as she seems to be having trouble finding her words. "Is this machine mocking me?"

"Uhh... I wouldn't really recommend trying to punch any of those blue crystals," Hadrik says. "Things didn't really go very well for the last person who tried that."

"Yes, that is the impression I got as well," Meridith says. "I always sort of assumed that machines are supposed to be cold, calculated and with no sense of humor, but I suppose I may have been wrong. At the very least, this 'Overseer' clearly seems to be familiar with the concept of sarcasm."

"If you think we're just going to let you two hold a private conversation about the Magium, then you might be far less intelligent than I initially thought," Meridith tells the Overseer.

"Processing... Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol is detecting an unnecessary amount of hostility coming from the lessathi leader named Meridith. After a quick analysis, it seems highly probable that this unprovoked aggressiveness of hers is partially caused by a feeling of inferiority towards me."

"What?..." Meridith says, baffled.

"Furthermore," the Overseer says, "it appears that her needlessly antagonistic behavior towards me can also be seen as an indirect result of her ever-growing frustrations, which are being caused by her inability to unite all of her people under one banner, and her overall incompetence as a leader."

 "Ahahahahahaha!" Kleykarth laughs heartily. "Overall incompetence as a leader! That's a good one! I like you already, Overseer! Hey, tell you what... How about you and Uverg hold your meeting inside the Heksol faction territory? That way, we can make sure that you two can have all the privacy you need, without being interrupted. Oh, and you don't need to worry about Meridith. She has no real hold over us, so she won't be able to intervene. Isn't that right, dear leader?"

"You are really pushing the limits of my benevolence, Kleykarth," Meridith says, with a frown.

"Is that right?" Kleykarth says, while smirking. "Well, what are you going to do about it, then? Are you going to murder every single one of us like you did with Heksol and then have your loyal dog use his acid powers again to disintegrate our bodies without leaving a single trace? Come on, say what you really mean! You know you want to!"

And I assure you that your sycophants from your faction know it too. They just don't really give a damn. It's not like Heksol was a universally beloved leader either. The man definitely had his faults. I won't pretend that he didn't. But at least he had the decency to win the position of leadership fairly, without resorting to such petty tactics as murdering his competition. We will never respect you as a leader, Meridith, no matter how hard you try to maintain this illusion of diplomacy between our people. You'd better get used to that."

"Am I to take this as a threat?..." Meridith asks him, cautiously.

"Not at all," Kleykarth says. "You see, unlike you, we from the Heksol faction would never stoop so low as to kill our own kind, just for the sake of a power struggle. We will also continue to cooperate with you whenever our goals coincide, as was the case with this mage tournament. However, if you expect to ever be on friendly terms with us in the future, then you are sorely mistaken. No matter how many times you'll try to sweet-talk our faction leader, the answer will always be the same. As long as you let us run our faction the way we want to, we can coexist peacefully. Otherwise, things might start to get a little... less peaceful. You can take THIS as a threat, if you want. I don't mind."

 "Understood," Meridith says. "Then I suppose I will have no choice but to have another conversation with your faction's leader, regarding this whole Overseer situation. I can only hope that he will be more inclined to see reason than you are."

"Don't worry, I'm planning to have a talk with him about this too," Kleykarth says. "I'm sure that he will be more than happy to welcome the Overseer with open arms, once he hears that he is a fellow Meridith hater. Oh, and I can put in a good word for you too, dwarf, if you want to join us. I don't think you'd have any trouble fitting in."

"Hey, I really appreciate the offer, buddy," Hadrik says, "but I don't think I'll be spending enough time here to actually visit your part of the base. Maybe next time, eh?"

"Well, I'll have to meet our leader today anyway, so I'll probably mention you to him regardless," Kleykarth says. "That way at least, the paperwork will be done by the time you ever decide to visit us again. That okay with you?"

"Sure!" Hadrik says, as he drinks some more ale. "Sounds good to me!"

"The Overseer protocol would like to speak to your faction leader as well," the Overseer says. "Would it be acceptable for me to join you when you meet him later?"

"Of course, of course," Kleykarth says. "Make yourself at home. You will find that we are a very welcoming people, much unlike Meridith and her stooges."

 "That is very good to hear," the Overseer says. "In that case, I look forward to a mutually beneficial and prosperous relationship between me and your people."

"Hahaha!" Kleykarth laughs. " 'Prosperous relationship', he says. Where do you even come up with this stuff? You crack me up, man!"

"Is it just me, or has the Overseer been antagonizing Meridith on purpose since the beginning, just so he could be on friendly terms with the Heksol faction?" Kate tells me in a low voice.

"That's very likely, yes," I whisper to her.

"Has he always been this crafty?..." Kate asks me. "He didn't give me that impression in Ollendor."

"He was cunning back then too," I tell her. "It's just that he was making more of an effort to hide his true intentions at that point in time. Now he doesn't seem to care that much about appearances anymore."

"If you will please excuse me, I have some other business to attend to, so I will temporarily take my leave," the Overseer says. "However, I will make sure to return by the time my new friend Kleykarth meets with his leader. I wish you all a pleasant day!"

"Hey!" Meridith says. "I'm not done talking to you. Do you hear me? Overseer!"

The crystal from above is no longer responding in any way. It looks like the Overseer really did take his departure, just like he promised.

"You are getting more and more impertinent every time you open your mouth," Meridith says, in a much more serious tone than before. "Do you really want to see what happens when I get angry that badly?"

All of a sudden, the expression on Kleykarth's face changes completely. The confidence in his eyes has disappeared, and he is now looking a lot more apprehensive. It looks like even in his drunken stupor, he is still capable of realizing when he has crossed the line.

"Now, now... let's all calm down!" Uverg says. "I'm sure Kleykarth didn't mean what he said. It's just the alcohol speaking, that's all!"

"You are telling me to calm down, but you are the one who disappointed me the most today, Uverg," Meridith says. "When everyone said that we should lock you up because you were crazy, I personally vouched for you. I assured them that despite your recent eccentric behavior, you had not taken leave of your senses, and that you were still perfectly lucid. And now you betray me like this?... You side with the Heksol faction and you agree to have a private discussion with a potential enemy that infiltrated our base? I thought you said you would remain neutral, and not join any of the factions. Was that just a lie?"

 "Lady Meridith, I apologize if you feel that I've betrayed your trust," Uverg says, in a humble voice. "Please believe me when I say that this was never my intention. Whether I am to meet the Overseer or not, it should be clear by now that he will be welcomed into the Heksol faction, and then any information that he might divulge will never reach your ears. However, if I befriend him and get him to tell me some of his secrets, I am more than willing to share my findings with you afterwards. While this may not be the ideal scenario that you had in mind, it is still better than the alternative. Whether you like it or not, the Overseer will infiltrate our base, and he will gain access to the Magium node. However, if we do not outright turn him into our enemy, our relationship with him could potentially become 'mutually beneficial', like he said. Of course, this will all depend on you..."

"So, you're saying that there is truly no way to stop him?" Meridith says. "Do you not see any way in which we could close his connection to the crystals, or--"

 "At our current level of knowledge, I'm afraid that is simply not possible," Uverg says. "Even being able to detect him through the crystals might prove difficult in the future, since he is likely to find better ways to conceal his presence, now that he knows I can sense him. I understand that this might not be what you want to hear, but closing all lines of contact with him may not be in our best interest for the time being."

"I see..." Meridith says, as she seems to be reflecting upon Uverg's words. "Perhaps you are right. Maybe it's not a good idea to be too hasty with our decisions until we know exactly what we are dealing with. On that note, Barry, you said that you have dealt with the Overseer in the past...

"This is more of a limitation than a weakness," Kate says, "but as far as we've seen, the Overseer doesn't seem to be capable of doing much else than observing and communicating by using these crystals. Normally, he shouldn't be able to attack you through them. Although, he did say that he was capable of accessing the Magium node, so it is possible that he's learned to use the crystals better in the past few days."

 "One thing that I think you might find of use is that the Overseer cannot tell any outright lies," I say. "The only way in which he can lie is through omission."

"Hmm..." Meridith says. "If this were true, then it could be some very valuable information indeed. However, I'm finding it a bit hard to believe that you could know such a thing for certain. How did you find this out? Was it the Overseer himself who told you about this 'weakness' of his by any chance?"

"Well... yes," I say, "but it is also a fact that we've seen him go out of his way to lie through omission in situations where it would have been much easier for him to tell a regular lie. He's also never stated any incorrect facts to us in any of our previous interactions with him, as far as we could tell."

"I see," Meridith says. "I have to say that I'm still a bit skeptical about all of this, but I will keep it in mind, nonetheless. Perhaps it could be of some help to us in the future. Does anybody else have any ideas?"

"This is more of a limitation than a weakness," Kate says, "but as far as we've seen, the Overseer doesn't seem to be capable of doing much else than observing and communicating by using these crystals.

"Actually, that has no longer been true ever since Billy Bob tried to deactivate him," Kate says. "He even admitted it himself that he was no longer bound by these rules, and that he could lie as much as he wanted now, remember?"

"Oh, right, sorry, I completely forgot about that!" I say. "I guess this weakness of his is no longer valid, then..."

"A pity," Meridith says. "This could have been very useful to us, if it were still the case. Does anybody else have any ideas?"

 "Yes, I've also had the same suspicion, but I wasn't quite sure of it," Meridith says. "Accessing the node can be done by simply linking his aura to it, so it wouldn't require him to have any offensive capabilities. We should probably not completely dismiss the possibility that he could have some sort of hidden attack up his sleeve, but for the moment we will go with the assumption that he isn't able to cast any spells while he is inside the crystals."

"I think the most important thing to keep in mind when dealing with the Overseer is to never underestimate him," Daren says. "He likes to act dumb a lot of the times, but he is much smarter than he looks."

"Yes, I've noticed that," Meridith says. "In the short amount of time that he's been here, he somehow managed to obtain an audience with the leader of my opposing faction just by saying a few words, so naturally, I'm planning to be very wary of him in the future. You can rest assured that the last thing I'm planning to do is underestimate him."

"While I do understand that it is important to be ready for anything," Uverg says, "have you considered the option of an open alliance with the Overseer? The information that he could share with us might prove to be extremely valuable..."

 "While that is indeed true," Uverg says, "you should also remember that you were the first one to provoke him, by openly stating that you would not allow him access to the Magium node. This gave the Overseer no option but to see you as his direct enemy, and to try to ally with your adversaries, instead. If you were to show more lenience towards him, then maybe he would--"

"No," Meridith says, simply. "The time for negotiations is long past. I will not forbid you to interact with the Overseer, since he seems to have taken an interest in you, but as far as I am concerned, the Overseer is a potential enemy that has infiltrated our base, and I will treat him as such until there is a strong reason for me to believe otherwise."

"As you wish, Lady Meridith," Uverg says, and then he takes a courteous bow.

"Anyway, I think we've discussed the subject of the Overseer long enough," Meridith says. "We have more pressing matters to attend to. Hadrik, I understand that you are harboring some resentment towards me at the moment, but there is something important that I must discuss with your group, and I need you all to be there, so you can give me your opinions. Would that be acceptable for you?"

"Alright, alright," Hadrik says, as he gets up from the ground and slowly puts his bottles in his backpack. "I suppose I've vented long enough. Let's hear what you have to say."

"Can this not wait for a few more hours?" Meridith says. "I would prefer to have my conversation with them in private."

"It concerns the analysis of the blue crystals that you asked me to do a few days ago," Uverg says. "I thought you might want the answer to that sooner rather than later."

"Hmm..." Meridith says. "Very well. In that case, you may accompany us for a short while, until you finish giving me your report, and then you will return to your quarters. Is that understood?"

"Of course," Uverg says.

"Let us head towards the Magium node tunnels, then," Meridith says. "We will have our talk on the way there."

"See you around, Kleykarth," Hadrik says, as we are going back the way we came.

"Yeah," Kleykarth says, as he extends a glass of ale towards Hadrik, without getting up from the floor. "Later, dwarf."

"So..." Hadrik says to Meridith, as we are moving away from his drunken friend. "Did you really kill that Heksol guy like Kleykarth said? Come on, be honest!"

"If you're trying to rile me up, then you should know that it's not working," Meridith tells him.

 "Ahem... " Uverg says, as we are still walking side by side through the underground tunnels. "Moving on from the surface-level analysis of the blue crystals, I would now like to summarize some of the main points that I think you will find most interesting, from the twenty-page detailed report that I'll be leaving on your desk later today. First of all, I am not sure if you've noticed this before, but the color of these crystals is not in fact completely blue. If you look carefully, you will see that there is also a slight tinge of indigo, although it can be easy to miss for the untrained eye. This to me was very shocking, because it would mean that the very name that we've been using all these years to describe the crystals might be completely incorrect! Further analysis may be needed, of course, but it may well be possible that in the near future, these 'blue crystals' could be officially renamed to 'blue with a slight tinge of indigo crystals'. Truly, we are making history!"

When we reached the entrance of the tunnel, we came upon Daren, Melindra, Flower and Illuna, who were just returning from the corridor leading to the lessathi base's main quarters, while seemingly in the middle of an argument with a lessathi guard, because he wouldn't believe them that they were official guests of Meridith and not just some unwelcome intruders. It looks like Daren and the others went in search of Hadrik through the wrong corridor, and they had been stuck arguing with this guard ever since.

As soon as Meridith figures out what happened, she explains the situation to the guard, and he lets them go, so that they can come with us towards the Magium node again.

 "Uverg..." Meridith says, trying very carefully to not use a dismissive tone. "While I do appreciate the enthusiasm that you've shown during your research, I must admit that when I entrusted this task to you, I was hoping you would make use of your... special talents to uncover the true nature of these crystals, rather than using the regular tools that we have at our disposal. Do you understand what I mean?"

"Aaah..." Uverg says. "By special talents, you are talking about the knowledge that I've acquired from the Magium node? Is that correct?"

"Yes, exactly!" Meridith says. "I'm afraid that our usual methods are simply insufficient when it comes to explaining the crystals' unusual behavior in the past few days. That's why I was counting on you and your special connection to our Creator to give us the answers we need."

"Hmm..." Uverg says. "Now that you mention it, I do have knowledge of a similar event happening once before, although it was over ten thousand years ago, back when the lessathi and the humans were still a single race. Would you like to hear about it?"

"Lessathi and humans used to be part of the same race?..." Hadrik asks, shocked. "That's the first time I'm hearing of such a thing. Is this common knowledge for you lessathi, or something?"

 "No," Meridith says. "This is news to me as well. Uverg, are you absolutely certain that this is indeed knowledge coming from the Magium and not just something that you're remembering from a dream?"

"I am quite certain, Lady Meridith," Uverg says. "Forgive me for not telling you about this sooner, but it sometimes gets difficult to remember what is supposed to be common knowledge, and what are obscure facts that the Magium has revealed to me alone, especially when it comes to events that happened so long ago."

"So... correct me if I'm wrong," Meridith says, "but are you claiming that the lessathi once used to be humans, and that something happened which caused us to lose all the magic in our auras?"

"Yes, although it wasn't something that happened overnight," Uverg says. "It is my understanding that the change between the auras of the two races was more subtle at first, and that it took several generations until the auras became so different that they could no longer be considered the same race, despite all of their other similarities."

"This would indeed explain why we look exactly the same as the humans, but I would have never thought--" Meridith says, as she takes a quick pause to rearrange the thoughts in her head. "There were no mentions of this in any of our ancient scripts. Why would our ancestors lie to us about this?"

 "It's most likely because our ancestors hated the humans," Uverg says. "I am not entirely sure, since the memories of this distant past are vague in my head, but I believe that the regular humans and the humans who would later become the lessathi belonged to two opposing tribes. One of the tribes lived underground, worshipping the Magium nodes as deities, while the other tribe lived on the surface. I think that when the Magium nodes were originally discovered, the ancestors of the humans tricked the ancestors of the lessathi to go and investigate the underground tunnels, and then they took away the ropes that they used to climb down there, leaving them all stranded. They would later also seal the entrance, to make sure that nobody would ever find their way down there again. Our forefathers have always hated the human ancestors for doing this to them, and their hatred towards their enemies has been passed down from generation to generation, until they could finally make their escape."

 "Is this why marriage between humans and lessathi is forbidden by your society?"

"Yes, although it hasn't always been like this," Uverg says. "Among the many thousands of years of lessathi history, there have been periods of time when humans and lessathi lived together in peace and harmony, and during those times, relationships between humans and lessathi weren't as problematic as they are today. I believe this new direction of going back to the 'old ways' started shortly after the still winter, when some more radical leaders began to emerge. Lady Meridith is probably one of the first leaders we've had since then that is actively trying to reverse this trend, but whether she will ultimately be successful or not in this endeavor still remains to be seen."

"You said earlier that you knew of an event similar to this strange awakening of the crystals that we are experiencing at the moment," Meridith says. "Was this in some way related to the transformations that those humans have undergone, which led them to become lessathi?"

#if(v_b3_ch11_escape == 1) {
 "How did they escape? Did they manage to invent climbing tools?"

"No..." Uverg says. "They invented a teleporting device."

"A teleporting device?" Hadrik asks. "With only the tools and materials that they had underground?..."

"You have to understand that it took them hundreds of years to escape from the underground," Uverg says. "At first, they had trouble even surviving. They had to learn which types of underground mushrooms and plants were edible, and they spent years exploring the vast underground networks of caves that exist all throughout Varathia. But eventually, they learned all the things that they needed, and they began to exploit all of the resources at their disposal. Their quick technological advancement did not begin, however, until they finally learned how to extract knowledge from the Magium nodes."

 "Since they worshipped the nodes, does this mean that the Magium spoke to them?"

"Not at all," Uverg says. "In fact, I think it took more than a hundred years before the Magium first contacted a lessathi. However, the real reason why these humans who were trapped underground began to worship the nodes was likely because of fear. They must have seen many of their comrades go completely insane after touching the Magium nodes, and thus they concluded that they had incurred the wrath of an all-powerful deity, and that they needed to treat it with the respect it deserved. I would give you more details about this if I could, but even my knowledge on the subject is unfortunately very limited."

 "I believe so," Uverg says. "Of course, it would be practically impossible to do a proper analysis after all this time has passed, but logically speaking, one would normally assume that it was the prolonged exposure to the awakened crystals that triggered these drastic changes in those people's auras. From the knowledge that the Magium has given me, it appears that the crystals awoke from their slumber after some sort of underground explosion that was triggered by accident. I think it took more than a hundred years for the crystals to go back to normal since then. If this is true, then I can only hope that the event we are experiencing now will not end up changing our auras even further."

"We can worry about that later," Meridith says. "You said that it took entire generations for these crystals to have any noticeable effect on our ancestors, so we should have enough time to figure things out."

"I suppose that is true," Uverg says.

"What I'm more worried about is whether these crystals could have any immediate effects that we are unaware of," Meridith says. "Did these memories of yours from the distant past tell you anything else that could be of use to us? For example, would you by any chance know of a way to put the crystals back to sleep?"

"I'm afraid not," Uverg says. "All I know is that by the time our ancestors managed to finally escape from these underground caverns, the crystals were already asleep. I don't think that our forefathers did anything special to make the crystals stop vibrating. My guess is that after a time, they simply stopped on their own."

 "Hmm..." Meridith says. "I'm not sure how helpful this information will prove to be, but at least it's a start. Thank you for your insights, Uverg. As always, your assistance is greatly appreciated."

"My pleasure, Lady Meridith," Uverg says, as he bows again.

"I'm curious..." Diane says. "How did the humans on the surface react when the lessathi from the underground finally made their way back outside? Did they try to send them back in again?"

"Actually, quite the contrary," Uverg says.  "They welcomed them with open arms. You see, it had been hundreds of years since the lessathi got stranded inside those caves, so by this time nobody on the surface even knew who they were. On the other hand, the lessathi never forgot. The hatred for the humans got passed down from generation to generation, and every parent made sure to constantly remind their offspring that the humans living above were at fault for their poor living conditions. However, the lessathi of old were a patient people, so they bided their time. They lied to the surface-dwellers, telling them that they bore them no ill-will for their ancestors' misdeeds, and they decided to coexist with the humans peacefully, while waiting for the opportune moment to enact their revenge."

"And what was this 'revenge', exactly?" Daren asks.

 "The lessathi spent the next few decades learning the ways of the humans and infiltrating their societies at the highest levels," Uverg says. "The majority of our ancestors were very skilled tinkerers and inventors, thanks to the knowledge that they obtained from the Magium nodes over the years, and so it was easy for them to gain the favors of many important figures of that time. Once the lessathi managed to obtain positions of significant enough political power, they staged a coup, and they dethroned all of the human leaders, placing themselves and their kin as the new rulers. They then enslaved all of the human population and they proceeded to conquer all of the other tribes, cities or villages in the immediate vicinity. Hundreds of years later, the lessathi would form an empire so powerful that it would span across all of Varathia, although by that time, the humans were no longer their slaves. They had been freed by some of the more benevolent lessathi rulers that followed and were allowed to live peacefully inside the lessathi cities, as second-class citizens, which is what they would continue to be until the total collapse of the lessathi empire, during the still winter."

"Wow..." Daren says. "Nearly ten thousand years of treating humans as second-class citizens just because of the bad deeds of one tribe, from an age long past. Your people sure can carry a grudge, huh?"

"Indeed," Uverg says. "The lessathi do not forget easily. Even now, after all these years, this has still not changed."

"Hey, Uverg," Hadrik says. "Would you mind if I asked you a personal question?"

"Of course not," Uverg says. "Ask away."

 "Alright," Hadrik says. "Well, from what I've seen so far, you look like a pretty smart guy, and you don't seem all that crazy to me, so I was wondering what is the reason why you dress like that?"

"Oh, you mean why I'm not wearing dark blue robes like the rest of the lessathi in this place?" Uverg says. "Honestly, it's just a matter of personal preference. I've never really liked the 'uniform' that people wear around here, and Lady Meridith has been gracious enough to make an exception for me, and to allow me to wear a shirt and pants instead."

"Actually, I was more interested to know why you're wearing a boot on your head and socks on your hands," Hadrik says.

"Oh, that!" Uverg says. "This is actually a social experiment that I'm doing. You see, most people who touch the Magium node like I did end up becoming quite insane, so I thought I'd try to dress up like a madman, while still acting rationally, in order to see how many people can see past the appearances and realize that I have not in fact gone completely bonkers. From what I've seen so far, there are very few people aside from Meridith who treat me as a sane person. It is always interesting to see just how many people are willing to completely ignore my arguments, no matter how well-constructed or logical, just because of the way I dress. Truly, this is a fascinating look into the depths of the human psyche, wouldn't you agree?"

"Umm, sure," Hadrik says. "If that's what you enjoy doing, then who am I to judge?"

 "It's not just the way you dress, Uverg," Meridith says. "Your way of thinking has also changed. You were always a little eccentric, but you would have never thought of dressing like an insane person just to do a social experiment before touching the Magium node. You didn't have this kind of complete disregard for people's opinion of you before. It's hard to put into words exactly what has changed about you, but if I were to try to describe it, it's as if when you entered the Magium realm, a part of you remained there and never came back. "

"I will have to take your word on that, Lady Meridith, since personally I do not feel all that different from how I used to be," Uverg says. "From my point of view, I am the same person, only with vastly more knowledge, and with an unquenchable thirst to learn even more than I already know. If the ways in which I choose to pursue that knowledge make me seem crazy to other people, then that is a price I am willing to pay."

"I know, Uverg," Meridith says, with a sigh. "I've already come to terms with the fact that you will likely never return to your previous self, but that does not mean that I intend to reject the person that you are now. As I have said before, you are free to wear what you want and to do your research in any way you see fit, as long as the quality of your work remains as consistent as before. Now, if there isn't anything else for you to report, I would really like to discuss something in private with my guests, if you don't mind."

 "Of course, of course," Uverg says. "In that case, I will go back to finish my written report. I will leave it on your desk as soon as I am able."

"Please do," Meridith says.

"Farewell, guests of Meridith," Uverg says to us. "It has been a pleasure!"

"Yeah, nice to meet you too!" Hadrik says, waving to Uverg as he leaves.

"Strange fellow," Hadrik says to Meridith, once Uverg is no longer close enough to hear him. "But I think I kind of like him."

"Yes," Meridith says, as she watches Uverg walking away, in the distance. "I feel the same way." 

After a few seconds of pause, Meridith turns back towards the rest of us, so that she can finally begin the private conversation that she was trying to have all this time.

"Now, then..." Meridith says. "It's time to tell you why I called you all here a second time. The truth is that after a discussion with Barry and Kate, I came to the conclusion that the original deal I offered you wasn't really very fair to you. As a result, I came up with a better deal for you, which I think even Hadrik might like. Allow me to give you the details."

 For the next few minutes or so, Meridith tells Hadrik and the others about the deal that she offered me and Kate while we were still in the meeting room. During this whole time, Hadrik has done nothing other than to listen quietly, with a look of complete disbelief on his face. Once Meridith was done, Hadrik and the others didn't say anything for a while, as if they were still waiting for her to continue. Realizing that Meridith has nothing else to say, Hadrik finally breaks the silence, saying what everyone else was thinking.

"That's it?!" he says, in a loud voice. "All you want from us is to keep participating in the tournament and you'll let us use the node for free? And we don't even need to decide now if we want to fight Eiden or not? Yeah, I'm not buying it. Something smells fishy, here."

"As I've already said, you only get access to the Magium if our plan to kill Eiden succeeds without your intervention," Meridith says. "Otherwise, you will need to kill him yourselves, if you want to use the node."

"Yeah, but that still means that in this case you'd be giving it to us for free!" Hadrik says. "You expect me to believe that the Magium is of so little importance to you that you just hand it out to everyone you meet? I pretty much already told you that I'm not planning to help kill Eiden while he's weakened, because it would be dishonorable. This means that you have nothing to gain from me. You're saying that you'd still have no problem giving me access to the Magium under these conditions?"

 "Actually, I do have something to gain from you," Meridith says. "As long as you keep travelling with your friends for the remainder of the tournament, then you will be protecting them from danger, and there are some good chances that at least some of them will agree to help us kill Eiden by the end of the tournament. In any case, I don't think you understand just how important this goal is to us. Killing Eiden has been the desire of our people for six hundred years. I would be a fool not to use every means at my disposal, when I've come so close to finally achieving the dreams of our ancestors."

"Hmm..." Hadrik says. "Well, deal or no deal, I am still planning to keep participating in the tournament, even if the prize is fake, since I came here for the adventure, not the Magium. If you want to give me access to your node just for doing what I was already going to do, then sure, why not? What have I got to lose?"

"I'm glad to hear you say that," Meridith says. "Is it safe to assume that everyone else also agrees with Hadrik?"

"Sure, I suppose," Daren says, as Illuna also nods her head in the background. "As long as you don't make us promise anything about Eiden, I have no problem with the rest of your deal. I'm pretty sure the rest of us also feel the same way."

"That's great to hear!" Meridith says. "To be frank, this isn't exactly the best outcome for me, but I'm glad that we could at least reach a compromise."

"So, now that we've all agreed to umm.... kill or not kill Eiden," Hadrik says, "what happens next? Are you finally going to give us the pinecone detector?"

"Not just yet," Meridith says. "There is one last thing that I want to show you, before you leave."

"What's that?" Daren asks.

"I want you to get a taste of the reward you would be receiving if you helped me," Meridith says. "I want you to know what it is like to actually access the Magium.

"What?..." Meridith says, confused. "But you seemed like you were okay with the offer when we discussed it before. Did you change your mind in the meantime or--"

"Oh, don't mind Barry," Daren says. "He's just being sarcastic. He does this pretty often."

"I have no idea what you're talking about," I tell Daren. "I never joke. I'm always serious."

"It's best to just ignore him when he's like this," Daren tells Meridith. "Trust me, it's for the better."

"I see..." Meridith says, still not quite sure what to think.

I suppose that could be arranged, but you'd have to make quite the contribution to our cause in that case. Tell you what, if when the time comes, you are the one to deliver the finishing blow to Eiden, you'll get your money in spades. How does that sound?"

"Good enough for me," I say.

"Perfect," Meridith says. "I'm glad we got that settled."

 "Now that you mention it, I was wondering if this Magium node of yours would come with a user's manual or not," Daren says. "Because let's be fair, I doubt that most of us would know what to do even if we gained access to it."

"There's no need to worry about that," Meridith says. "We have devices that were built specifically for the purpose of gaining knowledge from the Magium, without the risk of you going mad. The process will be slow, and it may take many years to get the information that you want, depending on what you are looking for, but the potential is limitless. I've in fact brought such a device with me, so that I can demonstrate to you how it works. So, what do you say? Shall we give it a try?"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa..." Arraka says, all of a sudden, with a slight tremor in her voice. "You idiots are not seriously planning to go back in the Magium node room after everything that's happened, are you?"

"Why, Arraka, if I didn't know any better, I'd almost think that you were afraid of going back to the node," Hadrik says, with a grin.

"Shut your mouth, you undersized circus freak!!!" Arraka shouts. "I wasn't talking to you!"

"Hey, there's no need to resort to insults," Hadrik says, looking as if he were greatly enjoying this. "Fear is a completely natural emotion. You don't have to be ashamed of it."

"I swear, if you don't stop talking right now, I'm going to--" Arraka says, but she is interrupted by a few very loud beeps coming from my pocket.

 "What was that?..." Arraka says. "Where did that sound come from?"

"Ah, Barry, I believe that is the sound your stat booster is supposed to make once your magical stats are ready," Meridith says. "Normally, you should be starting to feel the effects of--"

"Wow, this is great!" I interrupt Meridith. "I can already feel the magical energy flowing through me. It's definitely not as impressive as it was during the Emergency Mode, but I've really missed the feeling of being able to cast magic on a material plane of existence! Let me see if I still remember how to do the flight spell."

"As far as I know, the flight spell will only be available to you at a much later level," Meridith says. "Normally, you should have started with level one in both your magical stats, so you shouldn't be able to cast anything other than very basic spells at the-- wait, how are you doing that?..."

While Meridith was talking, I managed to recreate the air currents spell that I used while fighting the stillwater skeletons, and now I was flying around the cave, in a very clumsy way.

"What, the flying?" I ask Meridith, as I am still trying to find my balance in mid-air. "Oh, I'm just using the air elementalist powers granted to me by the device to create some air currents around me that are moving constantly. It sounds complicated at first, but if you treat it as if you were flying a plane, it gets much simpler."

 "Hey, not bad, Barry!" Melindra tells me. "They're not as good as my air currents, but they seem to get the job done."

"Barely," I say, while I am still wobbling around from one side of the corridor to the other. "I used to have much better control over these currents during the Emergency Mode. I'm going to need to put a lot of work into these if I want to ever use them in an actual battle at their current level."

"You're doing this just by utilizing the first level of Magical knowledge and Magical power?" Meridith asks me, shocked. "This... far exceeds my expectations. I didn't think there were even any useful spells before getting your second level in your stats."

"Oh, there are a lot of useful spells here, trust me," I tell Meridith. "Sure, they're not all that good individually, but there are some pretty lethal combinations if you know what you're doing. I've only just begun skimming the list of available spells, and I'm already amazed by their level of variety. This is going to keep me busy for days!"

"Then I suppose I made the right choice by unlocking these stats for you," Meridith says. "I hope you will find a way to unleash their full potential."

"I'm sure I will," I say.

"Now, can you please come down from there?" Meridith says. "I would prefer it if we all entered the Magium node room at the same time."

"Oh yeah, of course," I say, and then I drop back to the floor in a very inelegant fashion.

 "Splendid," Meridith says, as she now taps the wall in front of her with her wand, so that it will open our way to the Magium node room.

We all make our way back inside the room with the big blue sphere, and as we get closer to it, Meridith pulls out a small device with a lot of varicolored buttons on it, which looks somewhat similar in design to my stat booster.

"This is what we call a 'Magium connector'," Meridith says, as she shows the device to all of us. "You will be using it to interact with the node. Since you are only beginners, I recommend simply pressing on the green button for now. The red button should only be used by people who have interacted with the Magium at least a few times before, as it can get disorienting for a beginner. The rest of the buttons have some more specific purposes that I'm not going to bother explaining right now, since we don't really have the time. Anyway, who wants to go first?"

"Me!" Daren says quickly, as he steps to the front. "I want to give it a try."

"Very well," Meridith says, as she hands him the device that she was holding. "Just make sure not to do this for more than a minute. Even with the device acting as a buffer between you and the Magium, it is still risky to spend more time than that for someone who has never done this before."

"What about the Magium fragment?" Illuna asks, all of a sudden.

 "I'm sorry, the what?" Meridith says.

"The 'Creator' that we spoke to when we first came here." Illuna says. "Is he still in this room, watching us?"

"Oh, no, the Creator isn't always here," Meridith says. "He only visits us from time to time, to share his wisdom. Why, did you want to speak with him again?"

"Quite the contrary, in fact," Illuna says. "Did you hear that, Arraka? The Magium fragment isn't here. You can stop fidgeting now."

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Arraka says. "How would I even be 'fidgeting' inside of an amulet without any body to speak of?"

"Your aura was getting more and more restless the closer we got to the Magium node room," Illuna says. "To be honest, it was getting a little annoying."

"Oh, so you're an expert on auras, now?" Arraka says. "Maybe you'd like to give me some tips too, while we're at it?"

"Whatever you say, Arraka," Iluna tells her.

 Having touched the Magium node once already, I can tell with a high degree of certainty that the information available to me right now is only a small fraction of what the Magium has to offer.

I'm actually starting to think that the green button is meant to only give me a small taste of the Magium's knowledge, and that the red button is in fact the real access to the Magium. Maybe I should try pressing it?

 "So, all I have to do is press this green button over here, right?" Daren asks Meridith.

"Exactly," Meridith says. "The rest will become obvious once you press it."

"Alright, here I go," Daren says, and then he does exactly as Meridith told him.

"Wow, this is... I don't know how to describe it..." Daren says, amazed. "It's like every single piece of information that I ever wanted to know is almost within reach, but not quite close enough. The more I try to get closer to it, the further it gets, but I feel like if I could just spend a few more seconds like this, I'd eventually get my answer. It's... mesmerizing."

"Unfortunately, this is as far as you can get as a beginner," Meridith says. "The connector helps you become aware of the infinite potential of the node, but in order to actually get something concrete out of it, you'd need months and months of hard work."

"Yeah, I think I get what you mean," Daren says, as he presses the green button again to cancel his connection to the node. "If I calm down and think about it logically, it's clear that getting the knowledge I need won't be anywhere near as easy as it seems at first glance. But you weren't kidding about the potential being infinite... Even if we're talking about just improving my magic, there are still tens of thousands of things that I could make use of. At the very least, now I know that I didn't come all this way to Varathia for nothing."

 "Can I try it next?" I say.

"Yeah, sure thing, Barry," Daren says, and then he hands me the device. "I think you're going to love it."

"Let's see..." I say, as I get closer to the node and press the green button.

As soon as I do that, I immediately understand what Daren was talking about. I am still aware of the world around me, but at the same time I feel like my mind is connected to an endless library, full of books containing knowledge dating all the way back to the beginning of the universe. However, the access to them is clearly limited, and I don't think this is just because of me being inexperienced. In fact, it is far more likely that the limit has been placed by the designers of this device, in order to avoid traumatizing people who are still not ready to see the real thing.

 I decide to listen to Meridith's warning and to not press the red button. After a few more seconds of looking around at the endless library of unattainable information, I figure that I've had enough, so I press the green button again to close my connection to the Magium.

"Well?" Meridith says, seeing that I'm being oddly silent. "How was it?"

"Eh... It was alright," I say, in an unenthusiastic tone. "I was kind of hoping that I would obtain at least SOME concrete information out of this experience, but I've had no luck."

"Don't be discouraged, Barry," Meridith says. "Our scholars sometimes need weeks or even months to find the information that they need from the Magium node. There is nothing wrong with not being able to find anything useful in less than one minute on your first try."

"I suppose so," I say.

"So, who wants to go next?" Meridith asks.

 After me, Kate was the one who volunteered, and then Hadrik. Both of them seemed impressed with what they've seen, but you could easily tell from their reactions that unlike me and Daren, the two of them weren't all that interested in the Magium. Meridith also invited Melindra to try out the Magium connector, but she politely declined, since despite her recent interactions with Eiden, she still considered him to be her friend, so she didn't want anything to do with Meridith's deal to have him killed.

The last one to try out the device was Flower. Just as she was about to press the green button, Illuna's blue eyes suddenly started glowing, as she took control of the body.

#if(v_b3_ch11_red == 1) {
 I decide to ignore Meridith's advice from before and to press the red button.

"No, not the red button!" Meridith says loudly, when she sees what I'm doing. "You are not ready!"

The calm, peaceful sensation that I had before is entirely gone. I now feel as if I were caught inside the stream of a very strong river, while barely able to hold my head above the water. There is just so much information flooding my mind right now that it's simply impossible to make heads or tails of anything.

Meridith was right. Maybe this is too much for me to handle. Maybe I should just press the red button again and call it quits.

No, I can't just leave this place empty-handed. I'm sure that if I focus really hard, I can at least get one good piece of information out of this. I just need to think of something concrete.  Something that is both easy to learn and useful to me in the short term. What could that be?

Realizing that I'm running out of time, I focus on the very first thing that comes to my mind: my air currents. I then snatch the information away in a matter of seconds, and I press the red button again, closing my connection to the Magium node.

"Barry, are you okay?" Flower asks me, with a worried look on her face.

Now that she mentions it, my body does seem to be violently shaking, but I didn't notice that until now. Up until a moment ago, the Magium was all I could think of.

 "Yeah, I'm alright," I say, as I stop myself from trembling. "Phew. That was quite a ride."

"I should have known that warnings would be pointless when it comes to you..." Meridith tells me, as she shakes her head in disapproval. "Well, at least I hope that you learned something from this."

"I did learn something, actually!" I say, and then I activate my air currents, which are now helping me stay afloat above the ground without any more stability issues, thanks to the knowledge I gained from the Magium. "Look, my air currents work properly now!"

"I was thinking more along the lines of you learning to listen to others when they warn you against doing something stupid, but I suppose this will have to do, for now," Meridith says. "Okay, who's going next?"

After me, Kate was the one who volunteered, and then Hadrik. Both of them seemed impressed with what they've seen, but you could easily tell from their reactions that unlike me and Daren, the two of them weren't all that interested in the Magium.

 "Allow me," Illuna says, as she presses the red button, and then also a few other buttons in quick succession.

Seeing what she is doing, Meridith crosses her arms, giving Illuna a reproachful look, but she lets her finish what she wants to do, and only comments on her actions once she comes to return the device to her.

"You've used this type of device before, haven't you?" Meridith asks Illuna, as she takes the Magium connector from her hands.

"Yes, I did," Illuna says. "However, our old device broke a while ago, and it has been rather difficult to procure a new one since then. I thank you for being generous enough to lend us one of yours."

"You are most welcome," Meridith says. "Of course, had I been aware that you'd know how to use it, I would never have given it to you in the first place, but I suppose you already knew that, considering that you never bothered to tell me about this minor detail... So, did you find what you were looking for, at least?"

"I've found quite a bit more than what I was looking for, actually," Illuna says. "I believe that this newly acquired knowledge will be very useful in helping me develop some techniques that I've been working on for the past few days."

 "Lovely," Meridith says. "Well, I think that about concludes our session. I hope you've all gotten a good idea of just how much you could gain by helping me. Again, I'm not asking you to make the decision now, but it would still be nice if--"

"Meridith," we suddenly hear a voice echo from inside the Magium node. "Approach."

"Uhm, yes Creator!" Meridith says, as she immediately stops what she was doing and gets closer to the node.

"Your aura is trembling again, Arraka," Illuna says.

"Oh, shut up," Arraka tells her.

"Only Meridith," says a different voice, but still coming from the node. "No outsiders."

"Of course, Creator," Meridith says, and then she turns to us. "Could you please wait outside for a few minutes?"

"Sure, sure," Daren says. "We wouldn't want to intrude. Let's go, guys."

 "You don't have to tell me twice," Hadrik says, as we all get out of the room and then tap on the wall to close it behind us.

"So, what do we do now?" Hadrik asks us, after a few seconds of awkward silence. "Do we just wait here, or do we go exploring?"

"I wouldn't recommend going exploring without Meridith," Diane says. "You guys may have gotten lucky the first time with the two guards, but there are other lessathi who may be looking for any excuse to start a fight with you, especially if they know about Meridith giving away the holy scepter of Heldenbusorag to Kate. It would be better if we waited here."

 "Works for me!" I say. "This means that I'll have some time to look through the list of spells from my stat device. I'm already recognizing a few of the spells that Brinhorn was using on a daily basis while I was apprenticing for him. I actually helped him modify some of these to be a little more efficient. Let me see if I still remember the--"

"Processing... Processing..." the Overseer says. "The Overseer protocol had forgotten that some of the members of your group have a hard time understanding sarcasm. Allow me to clear up any confusion that I may have caused. The truth is that I do not consider any of you to be my friends. In fact, I hate you all, and I sincerely hope that you will die very painfully in the near future. But that is beside the point. What I came here to tell you is that after conducting a thorough analysis, I have reached the conclusion that it would benefit me if I were to sow distrust between your group and Meridith. As such, I took the liberty of recording part of Meridith's ongoing discussion with the Magium, which I think you will find most interesting."

"I think you're getting a little rusty, Overseer," Daren says. "You already tried that trick against us back in Ollendor, when you wanted us to kill the king of the underground for you. You're just going to make us listen to an out of context conversation again, aren't you?"

 "What do you want, Overseer?" Daren asks him, bluntly.

"First of all, I wanted to report to you that as promised, the issues concerning the seredium towers from Ollendor will soon be resolved," the Overseer says. "Upon closer analysis, I have concluded that these towers were not operating at full capacity, which is why I am now in the process of adding more mage slaves, so that everything will work more smoothly. No thanks are necessary."

"You heartless bastard!" Kate says, furiously. "Did you really show yourself before us just to tell us this?"

"No, this was only one of the reasons," the Overseer says. "The second reason why I have decided to contact you is to warn you about Meridith. She may seem like your ally at this point, but I do not believe that she has your best interests at heart. I took the liberty of recording part of Meridith's ongoing discussion with the Magium, so that I can show you what I mean."

"Sorry," Daren says, "but it's going to be a little hard to trust you after what you've just told us about the prisoners from the seredium towers."

"Negative," the Overseer says. "There were in fact two other reasons. First of all I wanted to report to you that my research towards improving the seredium towers is going smoothly, and I estimate that in two weeks we should already be able to free the first batch of prisoners, without affecting the city's energy source in any meaningful way."

"That is good to hear," Kate says.

"Secondly, I wanted to give you a warning about Meridith," the Overseer says. "While she may seem like your ally at this point, I do not believe that she has your best interests at heart. I took the liberty of recording part of Meridith's ongoing discussion with the Magium, so that I can show you what I mean."

 "Creator, with all due respect, I think you might be underestimating Eiden," we hear Meridith's voice, coming from the crystal. "The message he sent us was very clear. He told us to 'remember the still winter'.  This is almost certainly his way of telling us that he knows exactly what we're trying to do, and that he is confident in his ability to stop us. I've also received reports that for the past few weeks, he has been teleporting all across the continent, preparing a powerful spell of his own. If we don't do something, we might lose our last chance to end him for good!"

"What do you suggest?" the Magium fragment says, in the voice of an old man.

"It might not be the ideal scenario, but if we were to accelerate our plan, we might be able to get everything ready in a few days and then--" Meridith says, but the Magium fragment interrupts her.

"No!" the Magium fragment says, loudly, this time in the voice of a young woman. "The plan must not be rushed, or it will surely fail. Do you understand?"

"...Yes, Creator," Meridith says, in a reluctant tone. "I understand."

"As you can see," the Overseer tells us, once the recording has ended, "Meridith in fact knows a lot more about Eiden's message than she would have you believe. My preliminary analysis also suggests that this 'plan' of hers may not affect only Eiden, as she seems to claim, although I am yet to find out all of the details."

"Diane, would you happen to know how exactly Meridith intends to deal with Eiden?" Kate says.

 "I'm afraid not," Diane says. "I don't think that any of the people who know the details of the plan are allowed to leave the underground caverns, because there would always be a risk that Eiden could capture and interrogate them. I have a feeling that not even Jason knows what is going on behind the scenes, and Meridith usually tells him a lot more than she tells me."

"I'm sorry, who is Jason?..." Hadrik asks.

"He's Diane's brother," Kate answers him. "Which reminds me... Where is Jason? I would have liked to at least greet him before leaving."

"Jason is busy with an important mission, somewhere on the surface," Diane says, "so unfortunately, you won't get the chance to meet him today. But we might still run into him on our way to the sacred forest. I'll have to call and ask him later if he is allowed to disclose his location to us or not."

"Did-- did I hear you right?" Kate says, shocked. "Did you just say that you're going to come with us to look for the pinecone?"

"Oh, that's right, we never got to tell you..." Diane says. "Meridith was actually about to send me to Galamir before Melindra called her, so I talked her into letting me join your group. You know, since we're all going the same way! I hope you all don't mind!"

"Glad to hear it!" Diane says. "I know we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, but I assure you I'm planning to correct that. We'll all have plenty of time to get to know each other on our way to Galamir."

"It seems that Meridith is about to finish her conversation with the Magium," the Overseer says. "I will leave you now, as I do not wish to commence an argument with her again. Just be sure to remember what I said. Meridith is not your friend. If you make the mistake of thinking otherwise, you will surely come to regret it. Farewell."

"And... he's gone!" Hadrik says, as the bright light fades from the crystal that the Overseer was using to talk. "So, how much are you guys willing to bet that this wasn't the last we've seen of the Overseer?"

"I'm not taking that bet," Daren says. "The guy pretty much admitted that he has a system in place to let him know whenever we are underground. As long as we are anywhere near a blue crystal, I think it's safe to assume that the Overseer is spying on us, unless proven otherwise."

"No shocking at all?" Diane says, looking slightly disappointed. "Not even as a playful prank between friends?"

"Sounds like a deal!" Diane says, with a smile.

"No, no, he's right," Diane says. "I might be Kate's childhood friend, but that doesn't mean that I've given you any reasons to trust me, yet. However, I hope that will change once we've travelled together for a few days and you've gotten to know me better."

 "I'm sorry that it took so much time," Meridith tells us, as she closes the wall behind her. "The Creator had some important matters to discuss with me that could not be delayed any further. Anyway, I think I've held you all long enough. It's time for me to give you your pinecone detector, so you can be on your way."

"FINALLY!" Arraka says, in a loud voice. "I was starting to get really tired of this place."

"Did Diane have the time to give you the good news?" Meridith asks us, ignoring Arraka.

"You mean that she'll be coming with us to the sacred woods and to Galamir?" Kate says. "Yes, she told us."

"Splendid!" Meridith says. "Normally, I wouldn't have agreed, since her detour with you may delay her for a few days, but from what I've heard, the other diplomatic envoys will also be late, so there's not much point for Diane, of all people, to arrive there the earliest. Let's head towards the teleporter. I've hidden the pinecone detector inside a wall, somewhere on the way."

"Sorry if I'm being indiscrete, but diplomatic envoy for what?" Daren says, as we are heading back to the teleporter, together with Meridith. "What is Diane going there to do?"

 "Oh, you haven't heard?" Meridith says, surprised. "The dragon, Tyrath, has declared war on every living being on the continent that isn't a monster. At first, he was going to send his armies directly towards the cities of Varathia, but the orc captain of his elite troops has apparently managed to convince him to at least hold some negotiations before the war. Knowing Tyrath, his terms will probably be something along the lines of us dropping all our defenses so his forces can butcher us, but at least we'll have some more time to prepare before the inevitable conflict."

"So, Diane is the envoy on behalf of the lessathi, and I'm assuming the orc captain will be Tyrath's envoy," Daren says, while stroking his chin. "Do you have any idea who will be the other delegates?"

"The golden fox will most likely be sending Leo the leopard," Meridith says, as she opens a secret tunnel with her wand. "I heard that the dragons from the mountains will also be sending their own separate envoy, since they've never really accepted Tyrath's claim to be their rightful king. Oh, and I think Fyron, the goblin general, will be attending the meeting himself, if I'm not mistaken. Other than that, I believe that the king of Galamir will be the one mediating the conference, and that the other kings should normally be attending the meeting through holographic screens."

"Looks like there will be a lot of familiar faces at this meeting," Daren says. "We've all met Leo the leopard and the orc captain, and I'm pretty sure Barry said he and Illuna met Fyron, so the only ones we won't know there will be the kings of Varathia and the representative of the dragons. Maybe we'll have a chance to meet some of them in Galamir."

 "It's possible," Meridith says. "Although I don't really see a reason why you would willingly contact them. I highly doubt that you are in friendly relations with any of them."

"Fyron is our friend, kind of," I say. "Right, Illuna?"

"...Not by most people's definition of the word 'friend', but sure, you can call him that if it makes you feel better," Illuna says.

"Well, at the very least we know that he won't turn into our enemy," I say.

"Not unless it benefits him, no," Illuna tells me.

"Right," I say.

"So," Daren says, in a thoughtful voice, "this 'Galamir' is both the place where all of the tournament participants are meant to gather after completing their first objective, and the place where they will be holding the negotiations concerning a war that involves the whole continent. Somehow, I doubt that this is a coincidence. Is Galamir the capital of Varathia by any chance?"

 "No, it's not the capital, but you are correct in assuming that it's not just some regular kingdom," Meridith says. "Out of all the monarchs of Varathia, the king of Galamir is by far the one with the most influence over the other rulers from this continent. Whether it is by blackmail, by subtle manipulation or simply through diplomacy, this particular king has managed to bring many of the other kingdoms under his control, despite them being officially independent. On that note, you should be very careful how you behave while you are in Galamir. You were lucky that the last noble you killed happened to be from a kingdom that nobody cared about, but if you were to bring harm to any of the nobles in Galamir, you would almost certainly be kicked out of the tournament and teleported away from this continent in the very next minute, and I don't think any of us would want that."

"I see..." Daren says. "Thanks for the warning."

"I'm not sure if I should even bother asking at this point," Meridith says, "but is it safe to assume that Eiden was the one who gave you the ability to harm the locals of Varathia?"

"Yes," I answer her. "He did it right after we met the Earl of Ollendor in Thilias."

 "Of course he did..." Meridith says, in an exhausted tone, as she now opens another hidden tunnel with the aid of her wand.

"Speaking of Eiden," I say, while we are entering the corridor, "you never did tell us what his message for you meant. We've been trying to figure it out by ourselves for some time, but we didn't really reach a definitive conclusion."

"Really?" Meridith says. "I thought it would have been fairly obvious for anyone who heard it."

As she was talking, Meridith opened a secret compartment that was hidden in the wall on our left, revealing a thin metallic tablet inside of it.

"It is a declaration of war," she says, in a casual manner, as she takes the item from within the wall.

 Meridith then uses her wand to close back the compartment, and she hands the tablet to Kate.

"Here is your pinecone detector, as promised," Meridith says. "If you have any questions about how to operate it, you can ask Diane, but I'd say it's rather intuitive, so I don't think you should be encountering any problems."

"Thank you," Kate says, as she puts the tablet in her backpack.

"And now that I've fulfilled my end of the bargain, I believe it is finally time for us to part ways," Meridith says. "I would have liked to speak to you more, but unfortunately I have some urgent matters to attend to, which may or may not involve the Overseer."

"Well in that case, we are grateful for your hospitality and... for everything that you've shown us," Daren says. "You've certainly given us a lot to think about."

"I hope you will be thinking about the deal that I've offered you, as well," Meridith says. "It would be a shame if all this time I've spent trying to convince you was completely wasted."

 "Of course," Daren says. "As we've agreed, you will have your answer when the time comes."

"That's all I wanted to hear," Meridith says. "In that case, I wish you all good luck on your journey. Oh, and take good care of Diane for me, will you? She is very important to me."

"We will," Kate says.

"Goodbye," Meridith tells us, and then she turns to leave.

"See you," Diane tells Meridith, as she enters a hidden tunnel and disappears from our sight.

"Okay, so there are no more secret corridors between here and the teleporter," Diane says, as she turns to us. "Just stick close to me and I'll lead you out of here."

About a minute or so later we finally reach the teleporter room, where the lessathi teleporting engineer from Heksol's faction was waiting for us. When he sees us arrive, he frowns, while taking a long look at the scepter in Kate's hand, but he decides to no longer comment about it and to address Diane instead.

"Where to?" the lessathi asks her, simply.

 "The same place where you initially teleported us from," Diane says. "We'll find our way from there."

"As you wish," the lessathi says, and then he activates the teleporter.

Same as always, we get enveloped by a white light while vibrating loudly, and then we all find ourselves on the surface, in the exact location that we arrived from. Before anyone has a chance to speak, Melindra casts her air currents spell on herself and then she turns around so that she can face all of us.

"Well, guys, I guess this is goodbye," Melindra says, out of the blue.

I have no idea what to say in these situations, so I prefer to keep it short and to the point. Plus it's not like we'll never see each other again. I'm sure it won't be too much trouble to arrange a meeting once we've all finished what we set out to do."

Six hundred years ago, these types of stones were often used in the making of good luck charms. I figured that you could use some extra luck, considering how much trouble you usually get yourself into."

"Hey, that's very thoughtful of you!" I say, as I take the rock and put it in my backpack. "I'll make sure to hold on to this."

 "No, there's nothing you can do to help, aside from what you've already done," Melindra says. "I know I've been a little elusive about what happened to my brother, but one of the main reasons for that is because I'm not entirely sure myself of what has become of him, and I'd rather spend my time trying to find him than thinking about worst case scenarios. All I can tell you for certain is that he fell in with some very shady individuals a while back, who had him fooled that they had the best of intentions, and I've never heard from him since. Fortunately, I still have a few leads that could help me get to him, and with the item that I've retrieved from the late king of Ollendor, hopefully it shouldn't take me more than a few days to reach him."

"But then wouldn't it be quicker if more of us searched for him at the same time?" Kate asks her.

"I can travel much faster when I'm alone," Melindra says. "I can fly, remember? Look, there's no need for any of you to worry about me or my brother. You already have enough on your plates as it is. I promise that I'll let you all know as soon as I've found him."

"Fine," Kate says. "But you'd better be keeping your transceiver close to you at all times, because I'm planning to keep in touch with you, whether you like it or not."

"As a matter of fact, I would like that, icey," Melindra says, with a smile. "I would like that very much."

 "Do you-- do you really have to leave?" Flower asks, in a shaky voice, as she is still trying hard to keep herself from crying. "Can't you at least stay with us for a little while longer? There was so much more I wanted to talk to you about... So much more that we could have done together!"

"I'm sorry, Flower but I really can't afford to delay this any longer," Melindra says. "A part of me really wishes I could have taken you with me, but I also don't want to separate you from your friends. Of all the people here, you're definitely the one that I'll be missing the most."

"Can I at least-- can I call you often?" Flower says. "While you're gone?"

"As often as you want!" Melindra says. "And like Kate said, we'll still meet again during the rituals, so I'm sure we'll be seeing each other very soon."

"Okay..." Flower says, as she slowly stops sniffling. "I can live with that."

"Well..." Melindra says, as she takes one last look at each of us. "I suppose this is it, then."

"Aye," Hadrik says. "This is it."

"Not to ruin the mood or anything," Daren says, "but I'd advise moving slowly when you fly away from here, as an extra precaution. Normally, the enchanter's oath that you've taken should not require you to do anything else, now that we are in possession of the pinecone detector, but it never hurts to be too careful."

She then taps her transceiver again to close it and she turns towards us.

Flower then starts doing one of her usual military marches as she pushes us all from behind, in order to hasten our pace.

 "That... wasn't... the message you were trying to send her?" I ask him. "Look, if you want to rephrase your message more clearly, I wouldn't mind going back there to--"

"The message was phrased very clearly," Eiden says, in a serious tone. "I have no doubts that she understood exactly what it meant. The fact that she chose to interpret it this way is extremely disappointing, however. From what I had heard, Meridith seemed to be a lot more open-minded than the lessathi leaders before her, so I thought that maybe she would see things differently, and she would prefer to avoid all the unnecessary bloodshed. Perhaps I was wrong."

He then pauses for a few seconds, while the rest of us remain completely silent.

"So, did you take Meridith's offer?" Eiden asks me, bluntly.

"What?" I say, nervously. "What are you talking about? What offer?"

"The offer to kill me in exchange for gaining access to their Magium node, of course," Eiden says. "I'm assuming that this was the reason why Meridith invited you all into her headquarters? Given the circumstances, I really don't see what else she could have needed from you. Maybe we could skip over the pleasantries and commence the battle right now. You all seem to have gotten stronger in the past few weeks, so I'm sure you must have at least entertained the idea of trying to kill me once or twice..."

 "Wait, wait, wait," Daren says. "We didn't agree to anything! She did make the offer to us, like you said, but she gave us time until the end of the tournament to answer her."

"Ah..." Eiden says. "A wise decision! Now that I think about it, I suppose it would have been foolish to immediately accept such an offer, knowing that I can easily tell if you're lying or not from your auras. Well, in that case, there's no rush. Take all the time that you need to consider your options. After all, there is only an entire continent's fate lying in the balance!"

"Continent?" I ask him. "Don't you mean island?"

"You know, Barry..." Eiden says, as he now turns to look at me with his closed eyes. "I'm beginning to think that the real reason why I keep coming back to visit your group is because I've grown fond of hearing your wildly inappropriate and impertinent remarks. I should probably thank you for bringing some color into the otherwise dull and uninteresting experience that I've had since I've returned to Varathia."

"Hey, you're welcome," I say. "Always happy to help!"

 "Indeed..." Eiden says, and then he stays quiet for a few moments, to ponder on his next words.

"Very well, then," Eiden tells us, after a while. "Like Meridith, I too shall await your answer to her offer with great interest. Until then, we will continue to interact in the same way as before. The next time we will be meeting each other will likely be in Galamir. I look forward to seeing how you will handle yourselves in the rather... unique scenario that you will be encountering inside that city. Goodbye, for now."

 "Alright, let's go, then," Daren says.

"Of course," Diane tells him. "Follow me."

As we followed Diane further into the woods, my thoughts very quickly began to drift away from Meridith, Eiden and his message, because to me at least, there were far more important things to think about.

 My magical stats are working, and I also now know for a fact that there is a way to extract knowledge from the Magium without the risk of being erased from existence or becoming insane. All of a sudden, Kate's suggestion of me using knowledge from the Magium to modify my stat device into extracting its energy directly from the magical plane does not seem so far-fetched anymore.

This is quite possibly the closest I've ever been to realizing my lifelong dream. Maybe this wasn't so impossible after all.

Maybe... I can become a mage.
