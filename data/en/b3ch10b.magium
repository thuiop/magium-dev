 "Hey, Daren, there you are!" Hadrik says. "I've been looking for you. Care to join me for a short sparring match? I just came up with a few new techniques, and I want to see how well they work against a seasoned warrior such as yourself!"

"Uh, sure..." Daren says, without diverting his focus from the transceiver that he is currently working on with his enchanting tools. "Just give me a minute."

Hadrik nods, and he walks closer to Daren, so that he can have a better look at what he's doing. It's now been four days since we left Ollendor, but for the past twelve hours or so, we've been stuck waiting in the same forest clearing where we placed our tents yesterday. Melindra told us to wait here while she'd make the necessary preparations to contact her mysterious friend that is supposed to give us our pinecone detector, but she hasn't come back since, so we've mostly been keeping ourselves busy with our training.

Daren, on the other hand has been very preoccupied with his transceiver for the past few hours. At first, it seemed like he was just doing some regular maintenance, but now I'm beginning to think that it's more than that. Perhaps he is working on an upgrade of some sort?

"So, you're still not done with that transceiver of yours, huh?..." Hadrik tells Daren. "What's wrong with it? Did it break or something?"

#if(v_ch11_romance_rose == 0 && v_ch11_saved_rose == 1) {
 "There's nothing wrong with it," Daren says, without interrupting himself from what he is doing. "I'm just trying to improve it. I got an idea after a discussion that I've had with Arraka about auras yesterday, and now I want to see if I can make use of what I've learned from her to further strengthen the magical signal of my transceiver."

"But you said that it was already strong enough to contact people on other continents, right?" Hadrik says. "You want to make it even stronger than that?"

"It can normally contact people who are on other continents, yes, but I can't do it from this place, for whatever reason," Daren says. "Varathia most likely has some sort of signal-blocking spell cast all over the island, to prevent any outside contact except for the one authorized by the kings, and I'm trying to bypass this restriction. I feel like I'm really close to a major breakthrough, here. I just need to do a few final tweaks..."

"You sure are expending a lot of effort for this project of yours," Hadrik says. "Is there anyone in particular that you want to contact outside of Varathia?"

"Yes," Daren says. "My wife."

After hearing Daren's words, we all turn our heads to look at him, while Hadrik just stands there, confused.

"You have a wife?..." Hadrik asks him. "You never told us that you were married!"

 "Yes, well," Daren says, while still not taking his eyes off the transceiver that he's working on, "over the years, I've developed a habit of not mentioning her in casual conversation, so that I can keep her identity a secret in order to protect her. If any of my enemies were to find out about her existence, they might try to harm her to get back at me, and I couldn't take that risk. If you were to look me up in news articles or history books, you would also find it mentioned that I'm not married, because of all the false information that I've spread along the years. Right now, the only people aside from you who know about my wife's existence are the locals from the remote village in the Southern Continent where Sophie and I spent our childhood together, but they're all good people, so they've agreed to keep our relationship hidden from the outside world."

"And how is your wife, Sophie, handling all of this secrecy?" Hadrik says, with a slight grin. "Isn't she upset that she can't brag about being the wife of the famous healer in armor?"

"No, she isn't really the type to brag about such things," Daren says. "And besides, this current arrangement was her idea, not mine. My idea was... a little more extreme than that."

"What do you mean?" Hadrik says.

 "You still haven't managed to contact your wife after all this time?" Hadrik asks him.

"No, and I'm honestly starting to get a bit worried about her," Daren says. "It's been almost a whole month since I last spoke to her, and there was no reason to suspect that the tournament would take this long. I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must have been for her, waiting to hear from me these past few weeks, not knowing whether I was alive or dead. If there is even the slightest chance that I can reach her by doing this, I have to try."

"Alright, well, take your time, then!" Hadrik says. "No need to rush things on my account. You go ahead and make sure that everything's working as expected!"

"Thanks," Daren says. "I'll do that."

 "Hey, moron!" Arraka tells me, from the amulet around Flower's neck. "Stop eavesdropping and pay attention to what I'm doing. It's not often that you get the privilege to learn from a genius such as myself."

"I would pay a little more attention if you weren't so incredibly bad at explaining things," I tell Arraka. "I honestly have no idea how Illuna ever managed to learn anything from you."

"Be quiet," Arraka says. "It takes me a whole hour to cast this spell while I'm in the damned amulet, and I'm not planning to do it twice. The least you could do is have the decency to look at it. Now, are you ready or not?"

"Sure, whatever," I say. "I'm ready."

"Then make sure to observe every last magical particle flowing from my amulet," Arraka says. "If you do that, you will quickly understand why I'm showing this to you. Here it goes."

 "Well, when I first told her that I decided to journey around the world, helping the people in need, I offered her a divorce," Daren says. "I felt that it would have been too selfish of me to ask her to wait for me for years at a time, just for the few moments that we'd be together on the rare occasions that I'd return home. She didn't even want to hear about this proposition, however, so then I offered her a compromise. I told her that since it was my fault that we'd be away from each other for so long, I would not get upset at her if she decided to spend her life with another man, even if we would technically still remain married."

"And did she do it?" Kate asks Daren.

"No..." Daren says. "At first, I tried to push her away, convincing myself that it was for her own good, but no matter what I did, even if I went away for years on end without so much as sending her a letter, she would still wait patiently for my return. Seeing that I couldn't convince Sophie to let go of me no matter what I did, I eventually gave up, and decided to work on improving the quality of our long-distance relationship instead. That's when I came up with the idea to enchant magical transceivers in order to increase their range, so that we could continue to communicate even when we would be on different continents. At least... until now."

"Wow..." Hadrik says. "So, you haven't managed to contact your wife at all since this tournament started? She must be worried sick!"

"I know," Daren says. "Hopefully this will all change today. I think I've almost got this transceiver thing figured out now. I can feel it."

 "Alright, well, take your time, then!" Hadrik says. "No need to rush things on my account. You go ahead and make sure that everything's working as expected!"

"Thanks," Daren says. "I'll do that."

 As Arraka is casting her spell, I don't even get the time to wonder what she meant, because an intense feeling of dread overwhelms me immediately. It is the exact same feeling that I got during the first trial of the God of Time's ritual, and also fifteen years ago, when my sister first turned into a banshee. Come to think of it, I also remember getting a similar feeling, although not quite the same, when Arraka possessed Flower's body after breaking out of her amulet. Could this mean that she is now casting the spell that constitutes the basis of a banshee's awakening?

"It looks like you do recognize this spell," Arraka says, likely after seeing my reaction from the flow of my aura. "That's good. It means we should be making some quick progress today."

"What you did just now..." I tell Arraka. "It was extremely similar to what a banshee does when she awakens, but there was a very subtle difference. I can tell, because I had the opportunity to witness it multiple times during my ritual, and I also have a very good idea about the way that patterns form in most magical flows. I think the main difference was... the focus?"

"Exactly," Arraka says. "See? You can do it if you try. Yes, the main difference is the focus, but can you tell what the focus of this spell is? What is its true purpose?"

ID: B3-Ch10b-Banshees
TEXT:

 "Its true purpose?..." I say, and then I take a few seconds to think about what Arraka said. "Well, when a banshee awakens, the first thing that she wants to do is--"

I stop talking suddenly, because the image of my sister turning into a banshee suddenly flashes in front of my eyes, as I am trying to remember the details of the awakening. Once I calm myself down, I continue with my train of thought.

"The first thing that she wants to do is to seize full control of the host's body," I say. "When I was inside the God of Time's ritual, I could almost... feel the desperation with which the banshee was clinging onto her own life, fighting to drive my sister out of her body, so that she could claim it as her own. But if that banshee really was trying to use the spell you just showed me, then she was clearly using it wrong. That spell was never meant to be focused on the body, was it? Its real target should have been the soul of the victim. That is the real reason why the banshee who possessed my sister turned into an abominable monstrosity, while you and the banshee working for Talmak could retain the forms of your hosts. The true purpose of the spell you just showed me is... soul absorption."

 Immediately after I say these last two words, Arraka casts a spell that makes it sound like she is slowly clapping her hands.

"Bravo!" Arraka says, while the sound of clapping can still be heard in the background. "Bravo. Of the hundreds of people that I asked this question to in the past, you and Illuna were the only ones to have answered it correctly so quickly. Oh, and I suppose Flower figured it out on her own too, but I never really bothered to ask her the question, so it doesn't count."

"You asked this question to hundreds of people?" I say. "But... to whom?"

 "Banshees, mostly," Arraka says. "There was a time in the past where I may have had a... slight feeling of guilt regarding the expulsion of the female spirits from the magical plane. A very tiny, almost insignificant sense of guilt, mind you, but still guilt nonetheless. That is why I've spent the first few days after my banishment five thousand years ago teaching several of the older and wiser female spirits how to absorb souls in order to survive on this plane of existence. At first they refused, of course, but once it became clear to them that they had no way to survive in this world without acquiring an earthen body, most of them reluctantly agreed to use my technique. These older spirits then took it upon themselves to teach the soul absorption technique to as many banished spirits as they could find, and so, the first generation of banshees was formed. I'm not sure how many of those first ones are still alive to this day, but I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few of them were still around. Otherwise, I don't really see how the banshee working for the northern sage would have been able to find out about me and my initial role in the banishment of all female spirits."

"But... why are you teaching me how to absorb souls?" I ask Arraka. "What purpose could you possibly have for doing such a thing?"

"Why don't you try answering that question yourself, Barry-boy?" Arraka says. "What do you think is my purpose for teaching you about this spell?"

 "I think you want me to absorb your soul and steal all your powers."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "Now there's an amusing thought. Maybe it would be worth actually teaching you the technique at some point, just to see if you'd be stupid enough to go through with something like that."

"So, it is not the soul absorption technique itself that you are trying to teach me?" I say.

"No, it is not," Arraka says.

"Then what?" I ask.

Arraka sighs.

"Did you really not notice anything else about the spell I just showed you?" Arraka says. "Nothing at all? Please tell me that I didn't waste all of that time casting it for nothing."

"Hmm..." I say. "Now that you mention it, there was something else I had noticed. When you used your soul absorption technique earlier, you aimed it at the empty air in front of your amulet, correct?"

"Mhm," Arraka says.

"But the air doesn't have a soul..." I say.

 "Go on," Arraka says.

 "Normally, a spell made with a very specific purpose, like yours, shouldn't be able to activate if it does not find an appropriate target," I say. "If you were trying to daze a rock or put it to sleep, it would be impossible, because the rock isn't alive. Using the same logic, your spell should also cancel itself before being cast, if you do not target it at someone who has a soul in the ethereal plane. Since your spell worked even under these conditions, it means that the design of the spell is fundamentally different from the vast majority of spells that are being used by today's mages. The underlying principles behind this spell could potentially lay the foundation for a completely new branch of magic..."

"They already did," Arraka says.

"Come again?" I ask her, confused.

"I did form a new branch of magic, based on the underlying principles of this one spell," Arraka says. "I did it many thousands of years ago, back when I was still on the magical plane, and when designing new spells used to be a lot easier and faster than it is now."

"It used to be easier back then?" I say. "But why?"

"Who knows?" Arraka says. "Maybe it's because less time had passed since the primordial plane got split into three, and the new planes of existence hadn't been fully stabilized yet. Either way, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that I alone have access to these spells, and I'm planning to spend the next few days or weeks teaching them to you."

"Well, that's certainly... generous of you," I say. "What's the catch?"

 "There is no catch," Arraka says. "I would have taught them to you earlier, but you had no way of casting magic, so it would have just ended up being a waste of time. Now, at least you can cast spells on the ethereal plane, so there is some progress to be made. You've been practicing all sorts of spells in the ethereal plane for the past few days with Flower and Illuna's help, right? Well, now you can add these new spells of mine to the list."

"I'm not sure if that's how it works," I say. "As far as I understand, there is no real magic in the ethereal plane. The only reason why I can cast spells there is because people know about them, and so the ideas behind those spells can reach that plane of existence. If you're going to give me some secret spells that only you know about, I don't think I'll be able to cast them."

"It'll work, don't worry," Arraka says. "As long as the root of a spell is correctly imprinted onto the tapestry, you will be able to cast it no matter which plane you're on."

"I'm sorry," I tell her. "Imprinted on the what?..."

"I'm not exactly sure if this was supposed to be a joke or not," Arraka says, "but if something as simple as 'absorbing the Magium' would have ever been possible, I assure you that I would have done it many years ago."

"Okay, well, in that case I'm running out of ideas," I say. "Just what is it that you are trying to teach me?"

 "The tapestry," Arraka says. "That's what we call it on the magical plane. I'm not sure if you have an equivalent word for it here on the earthen plane, or if your people even know about it, but it's the place where all spells are defined. You know how most spells have certain rules and limitations, right? Well, the tapestry is the place where these rules are imprinted when the spells are first created. Every mage can access it subconsciously, although it takes a great deal of skill to find a spell in it that you don't already know about from somewhere else. Normally, you should have also had access to the tapestry when you had the opportunity to use your magical stats."

"Now that you mention it, what you say does sound somewhat familiar," I tell Arraka. "I always did figure that the spells must be coming from somewhere on the magical plane, but I never stopped to think about how it all worked until now."

"The tapestry is not on the magical plane, or on any other plane for that matter," Arraka says. "It is one of the few remnants from the days when all three planes of existence were still united, just like the auras and the primordial spells."

"Right," I say. "So basically what you're saying is that if I switch my consciousness to the ethereal plane right now, I should be able to cast that soul absorption spell of yours?"

 "No, not the soul absorption spell," Arraka says. "I only showed that to you so you could understand the basic principles behind it. Even the very crude version of the spell that I taught to the banshees would be too difficult for you to understand, since you're not a magical spirit that can learn these things intuitively. However, I do have a few spells in mind that will be particularly useful against the God of Time, and against that sad copy of me from the parallel universe that we were sent to during the ritual."

"But what about Eiden?" I say.

"I don't know," Arraka says. "What about him?"

"You fought against him before, didn't you?" I ask her. "Surely you must know some of his weaknesses! Or at least a few of the loopholes that he used to defeat you."

"His 'loopholes', as you call them were largely irrelevant on their own," Arraka says. "The first time when I fought Eiden during the still winter, he was barely comparable to one of the low-tier gods that I massacred on the magical plane when I went on my initial rampage. Sure, he had a ridiculous amount of magical power, and his inventive way of bypassing the rules of spells was rather impressive, but those were not the kind of tricks that I was complaining about when I told you before about my fight against him."

"They're not?" I say. "Then what?"

 "Like I was saying, in my first battle against Eiden, I bested him easily," Arraka says. "I would have killed him too, if that idiot stillwater Therius hadn't stopped me, giving the golden fox enough time to swoop in and teleport Eiden away from danger."

"How exactly did the stillwater that you were fused with stop you?" I say. "Didn't you say before that he was supposed to be a weakling?"

"He was a weakling compared to myself or Eiden, but he was still stronger than every other stillwater in that war, and he was also an ethereal," Arraka says. "The problem with ethereals is that their power gets multiplied exponentially while you fight them on the ethereal plane, especially inside their own mind. Therius may have been weaker than me on the earthen plane, but on the ethereal plane he was just strong enough to force a stalemate against me when I invaded his mind, and to cause our souls to fuse, instead of letting me absorb him. In practice, this meant that the two of us were forced to live inside his mind together for the duration of the still winter war, just like Flower and Illuna are doing now. Being of equal strength to me on that plane of existence, Therius was able to interfere with me on multiple occasions, including that one time when he saved Eiden from being killed, because they were apparently 'friends', or something. Not that their friendship really amounted to much when his old pal Eiden came back to murder us both, of course."

 "So, how did Eiden manage beat you the second time, then?" I ask. "Was it because he got help from the fox?"

"He got a lot more help than just from the golden fox," Arraka says. "The second time when I fought Eiden, it was like I was facing a completely different person. He wasn't using just loopholes anymore. He was essentially completely rewriting the rules of magic in increasingly more ridiculous ways all throughout the fight. It was an extremely frustrating experience, especially for someone as well-learned in the arts of magic such as myself."

"Are you sure that he wasn't just using loopholes that you didn't know about at the time?" I say.

"Of course I'm sure!" Arraka says. "Half of the things that he was doing in that fight were literally impossible. I'm honestly surprised that I even lasted as long as I did, considering how stupidly unfair that whole battle was."

"But if what you're telling me is true, and Eiden really can bend the laws of magic for real, how could anyone hope to ever defeat him in his current state?" I say.

 "I said that he 'could' bend the laws of magic at will, not that he still can," Arraka says. "At this point in time, he probably only has access to a very small selection of tricks, compared to what he had during his last fight against me. My theory has always been that his unparalleled magical knowledge during that fight somehow came from the Magium, but more recently, after having seen how a Magium fragment possessed the Overseer and almost undid our whole universe in an attempt to hunt down the other Arraka, I think I might have finally figured out what happened all those years ago. My guess is that one of the Magium fragments somehow came into contact with Eiden and the fox at some point after my first fight against him, and it gave them access to forbidden knowledge, for the specific purpose of defeating me. Once their purpose was fulfilled, they must have lost most of their new knowledge, except for the small parts of it that they got to keep as a reward for their cooperation. That is why they were able to invent a spell that creates food out of nothing, which normally should have been impossible by using only the knowledge available at the time."

 "So, you're saying that there's still a chance, then?" I ask her. "Eiden can still be beaten?"

"Why are you so obsessed with finding ways to defeat Eiden?" Arraka says. "He has hardly shown any interest in fighting against you in the past. As long as you don't openly provoke him yourself or step on his toes somehow, I don't see why you would have to fight him before you leave Varathia."

 "Maybe you're right. Maybe I should just concentrate on the God of Time."

"Focusing on Selkram is fine and all, but you'd better not forget about the other version of me from the past," Arraka says. "We will likely be forced to fight her before we'll have our final battle against the self-proclaimed God of Time."

"Yeah, I haven't forgotten about her," I say. "We'll make sure to be ready for her by the time we resume the ritual."

"Alright," Arraka says. "Do you have your notebook with you?"

"Yeah, it's right here, give me a second!" I say, as I pull the notebook and a pen out of the backpack that was lying next to me on the ground.

"Then prepare yourself," Arraka says. "You're going to have a lot to write down if you want to learn any of my spells."

Not long after Arraka starts giving me the details about her spells, we hear a very loud, distorted noise coming from Daren's transceiver while he is still working on it.

 "Can you shut off that infernal racket?!" Arraka shouts. "Some of us are trying to teach, here!"

"You're acting as if there is anyone in the world who could tell the difference between this noise and the inane ramblings that you call 'teaching'," Daren says, while he continues to work on his device.

"What is it that you are even trying to do, you oaf?" Arraka says, loudly. "Annoy us all to death?"

"You will see soon enough," Daren says, as he once again moves one of his tools and the pitch of the sound that the transceiver is making becomes even more unbearable to listen to.

After twenty more seconds of this colorful musical performance, the noises from the device finally stop, and they are replaced with a short period of complete silence, until Daren finally decides to pick the transceiver up in his hand and speak into it.

"Hello?" Daren says. "Can you hear me?"

There is a brief pause, but then we hear a woman's voice coming out of the transceiver, talking in a very hesitant tone.

"...Daren?" the woman says. "Daren, is.... is that really you?..."

"Yes, Sophie," Daren says. "It's me... I've been trying to contact you ever since I got here, but--"

 "You idiot!!!" Daren's wife shouts, sounding as if she were on the verge of crying. "Do you have any idea how worried I was about you?! I thought you were dead! I thought you were dead..."

We then hear her catching her breath a few times, while trying to stop herself from bursting into tears.

"I know," Daren says. "I'm really sorry. This island seems to block all outside communication that isn't authorized by the organizers of the tournament. I had no idea about any of this before coming here. If I had known, I would've--"

"I warned you not to go there..." Sophie interrupts him. "Why do you have to take these huge risks every single time? Why does it always have to be like this? Why couldn't you at least take me with you?..."

"Sophie, it's much too dangerous here for you!" Daren says. "I could not have protected you!"

"I can handle myself in a fight!" Sophie says. "You know that!"

 "This isn't the fighting ring back at home," Daren says. "Everyone here is a mage! Well... almost everyone. You would have stood no chance against them! Sophie, please, I know that you've been training hard all these past years while I was away, hoping that I'd one day take you with me on one of my journeys, but this was the very last place where I would have wanted you to join me. The things I have seen here... You couldn't even imagine--"

"Hey, jackass!" Arraka shouts, all of a sudden. "How about you get up from that rock, grab your transceiver and take that conversation of yours somewhere else? Preferably somewhere far away from here, where I won't be forced to listen to your grating voice while I conduct my lesson."

"How about I take your amulet and throw it in a river, you annoying old hag?" Daren snaps. "Can you seriously not keep quiet for even one minute?"

"Uhm... Daren?" Sophie says. "Who was that?"

"Oh, that was..." Daren says, trying in vain to find a way to describe Arraka to someone who has never met her before. "That was, uh--"

"Her name is Arraka," Hadrik intervenes. "She is a ten-thousand-year-old spirit trapped in an amulet who has threatened to destroy the entire world several times in the past, and she also killed more than half of the gods by herself. I'm Hadrik, by the way. A good friend of Daren's. Very pleased to make your acquaintance!"

 "A friend?..." Sophie asks, sounding very shocked. "But... Daren doesn't have any friends!"

"Hahahahaha!" Hadrik laughs. "I thought you might say something like that. I assure you that I am quite real, and not at all imaginary, if that is what you are implying!"

"No, you don't understand!" Sophie says. "Daren always travels alone. He's done it all his life. And even when he comes back here, he barely interacts with anyone from our home town. He's practically been pushing people away for as long as I can remember! I've heard many people being grateful to him for saving them, or singing his praises because of his heroic deeds, but I've never heard anyone openly calling him a friend before. What has changed? Is he not still the same grumpy and unapproachable Daren that I've known since we were kids?"

"Oh, you don't need to worry about that!" Hadrik says. "He's still just as grumpy as ever. But we've all gotten used to it!"

 " 'All'?..." Sophie asks, confused. "There are more of you? How many people are travelling in your group right now?"

"There are currently... eight of us, depending on how you want to count us," Daren says. "Technically, two are living inside the same body, but they are still two different individuals, so--"

"Eight people?!" Sophie says. "You are travelling with seven other people? And... are the rest of these people your friends as well?"

"I mean... yeah, I'd like to think so!" Daren says. "Some of them, at least."

 "Don't worry, we're all his friends. Your husband is in good hands."

"Speak for yourself, you lunatic!" Arraka says. "If the day ever comes when I'll be calling any of you my friends, you have my permission to slit my throat and put an end to my misery, because that would be the day when I've clearly taken leave of all my senses!"

All of a sudden, Daren's wife lets out a burst of laughter.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh," Sophie says. "It's just that... I'm so happy for you, Daren! I never thought I'd see the day when you would be surrounded by a group of friends, bickering with each other. It all feels so surreal... Maybe something good came out of this mage tournament after all!"

"I don't mean to interrupt," Kate says, "but I'm finding it rather odd that you were more shocked about Daren having friends than about the mention of a ten-thousand-year-old spirit in an amulet, or the two individuals living inside the same body. Can we be certain that all the words are being properly transmitted through the transceiver at this time?"

"Oh, no, I heard about the spirit in an amulet and all the other stuff, but... Daren and his friend, umm... Hadrik were just joking, right?" Sophie says. "There's no way that they were being serious about you travelling with an evil spirit that has killed half of the gods, right?..."

She then pauses for a little, seeing that none of us answer her.

"Right?..." she asks again, this time in a more uncertain tone.

 "Sophie," Daren says, "I think you might need to grab a glass of water and sit down somewhere. There are a lot of things that I need to tell you about."

It takes Daren over half an hour to properly summarize all of the things that have happened to us ever since we came to Varathia, but eventually he manages to bring his wife up to speed with most of the main events that occurred during our time here. 

Sophie had to ask Daren multiple times during his recounting of the events if he was being serious or not, due to just how unbelievable some of his stories were, but eventually she understood that none of what he was saying was a joke, and she trusted him enough to not doubt any of the things that he told her about, no matter how ridiculous they may have sounded from an outsider's perspective.

Once Daren is done with his story, Sophie stays silent for a short while, trying to put everything together in her head.

"Daren..." Sophie says, eventually. "These things that you have told me... Your ongoing efforts to defeat one of the gods... your travel to a world from the past, where there were metal vehicles flying in the sky...  your talk about an entity that can erase entire universes from existence... This is a lot to take in."

"I know," Daren says. "Trust me, I've experienced all of this first-hand, and I still find some of it hard to believe. But it's all true, I promise!"

 "Daren, I believe you, but-- don't you think you might be pushing yourself too much?" Sophie says. "At first, it was only about saving as many people as possible. Then, you wanted a way to save all the people from suffering. I thought you had finally found a way to do that by joining this tournament, but now I find out that this world of ours isn't even all there is to it. From what you've told me, there must be thousands of other worlds out there, maybe even millions, all of them with different versions of ourselves doing different things. Will you want to save those worlds too? Where does it all end?"

"I... haven't really thought about that," Daren says. "Maybe once I'll gain access to the Magium, I'll be able to travel between worlds, and then I'll--"

"NO!" Sophie shouts. "No, no, no! Letting you leave to other continents is one thing, but letting you go to whole other worlds is too much! If you want to travel to other worlds, you're going to have to take me with you, do you understand? I'm going with you! I don't want to live through the fear of losing you like this ever again!!!"

"Okay, okay!" Daren says. "I'm sorry! Next time I leave anywhere, I'm taking you with me. I promise!"

"...Do you really mean that?" Sophie asks.

"Yes!" Daren says. "You have my word!"

"I will hold you to this promise, you know..." Sophie says. "I will remind you of it until the day you die."

"I wouldn't have it any other way," Daren says, while smiling.

 "Ahem..." Hadrik says. "I realize that you two haven't talked in a long while, and I really hate to interrupt, but maybe it's time to move this conversation somewhere else. As patient as Arraka has proven to be until now, I think she might actually start casting curses on us in our sleep if we delay her magical lesson any longer than we already have."

"Oh, there is no need!" Sophie says. "I've already gotten the main gist of what's happened these past few weeks, so we can stop our discussion here, for now. I'll go run some errands, and then Daren and I can talk more later, when you're all less busy. Would that be alright with you, Daren?"

"Of course," Daren says. "I'll talk to you later, then!"

"Bye!" Sophie says. "Oh, and it was nice meeting all of you! Please take good care of Daren... From what you've been telling me, I expect that he'll need all the help he can get."

"Will do, miss Sophie," Hadrik says. "Will do!"

"Goodbye!" Sophie says, and then she closes the transceiver.

"Finally!" Arraka says. "I thought you two would never shut up."

"I don't know why you're complaining so much," Daren says, as he puts his transceiver down and begins to gather his enchanting tools, to put them in his backpack. "If anything, you should be happy that I actually managed to put some of your worthless teachings to good use."

 "I will stop complaining when you will start-- wait, what do you mean my 'teachings'?" Arraka says. "Are you talking about my aura lessons?"

"Yeah," Daren says. "I remembered what you told me yesterday about how one can bolster the link between two auras by identifying key points in the flow that appear to be 'tied into knots' and gently pulling on the invisible strings until I can untie them. These so-called 'knots' sounded very similar to the typical blockages that I would normally encounter when enchanting my transceivers to have a more powerful signal, except that I would always try to either find my way around them or eliminate them entirely, and I had never once thought that I had the option to simply untie them as if they were strings. As soon as I applied this process to my enchanting, everything became much easier."

"...Flower, can you take me closer to Daren?" Arraka says. "I want to have a better look at this transceiver of his."

"Umm, sure!" Flower says, and then she does as Arraka asked.

Once her amulet is closer to the transceiver, Arraka spends about thirty seconds observing it in silence. Just as we were about to ask her what she's doing, Arraka finally speaks, in a very calm, but obviously restrained tone of voice.

 "Daren..." Arraka says. "Do you remember how on the very first day when we started your aura training, I told you that in order to contact the spirit from the magical plane that is linked to your aura, you would need to untangle the flow of your aura with your mind, and that then you would need to pull on the invisible string to get the spirit's attention?"

"Mhm," Daren says.

"Correct me if I'm wrong," Arraka says, "but from what you told me in the past, your main problem was that you couldn't identify the string that was linking you to your spirit. You said that even after the goblin Kelrim finally got you to understand what I meant by untangling the flow of your aura, you still couldn't complete your task because you would have no way of knowing how to isolate the strings well enough to be able to analyze them individually. Were these not your exact words?" 

"That is what I said, yes," Daren responds to her.

"Then would you mind explaining to me why this device, created by you, is able to perform the exact task which you said was impossible for you to do?" Arraka asks, sounding as if she were barely able to contain her anger.

 "Of course," Daren says. "You see, it's quite simple, really. The transceiver is an object, which means that as an enchanter, I can use my enchanting tools on it to freely manipulate its aura in any way I see fit. Obviously, I've only learned this fact recently, after I found out that objects have auras, because until a week ago I was sure that I was just using my tools to cast enchantment spells on these items. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that I can't use my enchanting tools on myself, because I'm not an object, so analyzing my own aura in order to find the invisible string you are talking about still remains just as impossible to me as before."

"Then use your transceiver, you bumbling imbecile!!!" Arraka finally snaps. "Do I really have to tell you everything?!"

"You want me to use my transceiver to... contact a magical spirit on another plane of existence?..." Daren asks, confused.

"YES!" Arraka says. "Just what kind of a moron are you? I can't believe that I've wasted so many hours of my life trying to explain all these abstract concepts to you when you could have easily done what I asked of you from the very beginning! If it wouldn't take me so long to conjure two physical hands from this amulet, I would strangle you to death on the spot!!!"

 "You're not making any sense..." Daren says. "You told me that the only way to contact this spirit is through the link that exists between our two auras. How exactly is my transceiver supposed to help in this situation?"

"You need to LINK it to your aura, genius," Arraka says. "First you link your transceiver to your aura, then you rotate that dial of yours until you find the correct frequency, and once you've identified it, you use your enchanting tools to untangle the flow of the aura. I can't believe that I need to actually tell you how to do your own job."

"If you knew that it was possible to do all this with a transceiver, then why didn't you just tell me?" Daren says. "It would have saved us both the trouble."

"How was I supposed to know that this is how your transceiver works, you buffoon?" Arraka says. "I already told you once before that I couldn't have any less of an interest in tinkering with devices. Enchanting is the one type of magic that I know almost nothing about, because I never could be bothered to give a damn. There are no physical objects on the magical plane, so I had no idea that this branch of magic even existed until I was banished to this realm. You're the only one here who knew enchanting well enough to be able to figure it out!"

 "Okay, fine," Daren says. "Next time, I won't make the mistake to assume that you know what you're talking about. I've learned my lesson."

"Just shut up and get to work," Arraka says. "If we're lucky, we might be able to contact that spirit of yours before it's time for you to go to sleep. The one good thing about all of this is that your transceiver will allow every one of us to talk to your spirit, not just you, so at least I'll be able to communicate with him directly. You'd better not mess this up."

"Yeah, yeah," Daren says, as he is now getting his enchanting tools out of his backpack again, so he can work on his transceiver.

 For the next hour or so, Daren focused on linking his transceiver to his aura like he said he would, while Arraka continued to teach me about the spells that she created while she was still in the magical plane. By the time she was finished telling me about the most basic spells in her repertoire, I had already filled ten pages of my notebook with all of the obscure and technical details she had given me.

In the meantime, each of the other members of our team had kept themselves busy with individual trainings of their own, aside from Melindra, who still hadn't returned since this morning. As Arraka was just about to end her introductory lesson and move on to somewhat more advanced notions, we hear Daren calling out to us.

"Guys, I think I did it!" he says in a loud voice. "Come over here for a second."

We all gather slowly around Daren, to see what he's talking about. Upon getting closer to him, I realize that the transceiver does indeed feel different from before. It's hard to describe exactly what is different about it, but if I were to try and put it into words, I'd say that the device seems to be perfectly in tune with Daren's aura, to the point where it reacts to his every movement, or even a slight change in his emotions or tone of voice.

 When he sees that we are all close enough to hear him clearly, Daren takes the transceiver in his hand and then turns towards Arraka.

"The transceiver is linked to my aura now, and I've taken care of all the blockages that could obstruct the communications channel to the magical plane," Daren says. "The only thing that remains to be seen is if the frequency that I set it to is correct."

"There would have been no blockages to take care of if you hadn't chosen the correct frequency, so I doubt there's any way you could have gotten it wrong," Arraka says. "Either way, we'll know for sure that it works as soon as we contact your spirit. Now hurry up and activate your transceiver! I'm curious to see which spirit you've been linked to, and whether I know them or not."

"I'm not talking about the main topic of our conversation, but about the way we'll be interacting with this spirit," I say. "What if we're really unlucky and Daren is linked to one of the gods that you fought five thousand years ago? Or even worse, what if he's linked to the God of Time himself?"

"If Daren is linked to Selkram, then we're obviously screwed," Arraka says. "The chances of that happening are almost non-existent, though. If it's one of the gods, it will be a bit harder to get them to do what we want, but I'm sure we can work things out with a little effort."

"See, that's what I was trying to say!" I tell her. "We don't have a proper plan for when things go horribly wrong. There is too much at stake here to rely purely on improvisation!"

"Okay, smart-ass," Arraka says, "so what do YOU propose we do, then?"

"Well, the way I see it, most of our problems stem from the possibility that this spirit recognizes you and hates your guts, right?" I say. "So how about we let only Daren talk for the first few minutes, and we'll see if he can get the spirit to help him repair their link, at least. Then, we'll see if he can convince the spirit that he knows from 'credible sources' that the God of Time and the God of Death have been absorbing other denizens of the magical plane."

 "They won't believe him unless he gives them enough details about the soul absorption technique to verify this information for themselves," Arraka says. "And if you do give them those details, then they will surely know it's from me."

"Has it not been thousands of years since you last spoke to anyone on the magical plane?" I say. "For all they know, you could very well be dead by now, and the only reason why we are familiar with your soul absorption technique is because you taught it to others on the earthen plane, and then they taught it to their descendants... which could technically be true, since you did say that you told the early banshees about your technique."

"Alright, fine," Arraka says. "I see your point. I'll give Daren the details he needs to convince the spirit, and if he can't explain it well enough on his own, only then will I intervene. Are you happy, now, or do you have something else to add?"

"No, I'd say that should be about enough," I answer her, and then Arraka begins to give Daren the information that he needs to relay to his linked spirit in order to make them believe him.

Once she is done, Daren tells us that he is about to open the channel, and he taps his transceiver. 

"Hello?" Daren says. "Is there anyone there?"

He waits for a few moments, but he does not get an answer.

"Can you hear me?" Daren asks again.

}
#if(v_b3_ch10_beforehand == 0) {
 "Wouldn't it be a bad thing if they knew you, considering your history there?"

"Not necessarily," Arraka says. "Sure, I made a lot of enemies back in the days, but believe it or not, I also had a few allies. Since I was mainly targeting the gods and their followers from the magical plane, some of the spirits who didn't like the gods' policies were rallying behind me, thinking that I was trying to start a revolution or something."

"And you think any of them might still be alive?" I ask.

"Anyone who was dumb enough to mistake my personal beef with the gods as some sort of crusade against evil tyrants was likely executed soon after my banishment, as punishment for fighting together with me," Arraka says. "There were, however, plenty of spirits who chose to not take any sides during that conflict, and I see no reason why some of them would not still be around today."

"Well, then let's hope that the spirit I'm linked with is one of the neutral ones, because otherwise this whole thing may end up being a huge waste of our time," Daren says. "I'm opening the channel now. Get ready."

He then taps the transceiver and begins to speak into it.

 "Hello?" Daren says. "Is there anyone there?"

He waits for a few moments, but he does not get an answer.

"Can you hear me?" Daren asks again.

}
 "Who are you?" we hear a heavily distorted male voice with a powerful echo, coming from the transceiver. "What do you want?"

"Uh... my name is Daren," says Daren. "I'm contacting you from the earthen plane, to ask you if you can help me with--"

"The earthen plane?" the spirit says. "Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?"

"No, sir," Daren says. "I'm calling you because our two auras are apparently linked together, and you are acting as some kind of funnel for me to extract energy from the magical plane. My problem is that--"

"You will undo this link at once!" the spirit says. "Do you understand?"

"Look, even if I wanted to, the link was done subconsciously ever since my birth," Daren says. "I don't think it would be possible for any of us to cancel it of our own free will. Now, if you could just listen to me for a second, there are only a few things I want to ask of you and then I will leave you alone."

"Unacceptable," the spirit says. "No earthen creature will extract my energy without my permission. If you will not cease your actions immediately, you will be faced with severe consequences."

 "What consequences, man?..." Daren says. "We are on different planes of existence. Are you seriously trying to tell me that if I don't stop using magic, you'll come here and beat me up?"

"Your insolence does not amuse me, earthen creature," the spirit says. "I have given you a warning, and you would do well to heed it."

"Why do you keep calling me 'earthen creature'?" Daren says. "Is it because of some magical plane dialect that I don't understand, or are you just saying that to fool yourself into thinking that you are superior to me?"

"You are trying to provoke me with your words, but the only thing you will get from me is pity, nothing more," the spirit says.

"You do realize that I won't leave you alone until I get what I want from you, right?" Daren says. "We can do this all night. I've got all the time in the world."

"Then you will be speaking to yourself," the spirit says. "I have nothing more to say to you."

"Hey, you asked for it," Daren says. "I should warn you, though... I know the verses to a lot of old folklore songs, and I am a terrible singer. Just tell me when it's too much for you, and I'll stop."

 Daren then begins to sing what appears to be the national anthem of one of the countries from the Southern Continent, and I can confirm that he is indeed a horrible singer. I don't think he's hit a single correct note so far, and it doesn't really feel he's planning to, either. The problem with this plan of his is that the spirit from the magical plane isn't the only one who has to listen to him sing, and it looks like some of us are already reaching our limits.

"Good gods!" Hadrik says. "Daren, have mercy on us, please!"

"This cannot be a real song," Kate says, while covering her ears with her palms. "I refuse to believe it."

"So, is it safe to assume that you'd like me to intervene now, or would you perhaps prefer to listen to the whole concert?" Arraka asks me.

"Fine, you win," I tell Arraka. "If it will make the singing stop, then do what you have to do."

"Very well," Arraka says, and then she starts shouting so that the spirit can hear her through the background noise of Daren's singing. "Hey, Jirinn! Are you enjoying the serenade? There's no shame in begging him to stop, you know. Even 'supreme beings' such as yourself must have their breaking point."

"That voice..." the spirit from the magical plane says, as Daren has now stopped his song. "I haven't heard that voice in thousands of years. Could it truly be... Arraka?"

}
#if(v_b3_ch10_beforehand == 0) {
 "Oh, lighten up, Jirinn," Arraka says. "It's been five thousand years, and you're still just as uptight as I remember you."

 "That voice..." the spirit from the magical plane says. "I haven't heard that voice in thousands of years. Could it truly be... Arraka?"

}
 "You got it right on the first try," Arraka says. "I guess they don't call you 'enlightened' for nothing."

"I should have known that you would still be alive after all this time," says Jirinn, the spirit. "You always were particularly hard to kill. Just like a cockroach."

"They have cockroaches on the magical plane?" Daren says. "Wasn't everything there supposed to be non-corporeal?"

"I already told you that almost every earthen race has an equivalent on the magical plane, you twit," Arraka says. "That obviously also includes all manner of animals and insects."

"So, after five thousand years, you finally found a way to make contact with the magical plane, did you, you old hag?" Jirinn tells Arraka through the transceiver. "So, what's next, then? Are you planning to come back and finish what you started? Because I've been itching to kill you ever since the last time we fought, and I could definitely use the practice."

"If you're in the mood for a fight, then I have just the thing for you," Arraka says. "What if I told you that the reason for the banishment of all females of the civilized races from the magical plane was a lie fabricated by the God of Time, the God of Death and the God of Fate? What if I were to tell you I have unquestionable proof that Selkram and Ulruk themselves have used my soul absorption technique in the past?"

 "You're talking about that spell of yours which you used to absorb other spirits?..." Jirinn says. "If I recall correctly, this was the reason invoked by the three gods you mentioned that convinced all the other gods and powerful spirits to agree with the plan of banishing the rest of the women along with you. I remember that they came up with some very weak proof that only women of the civilized races could cast the spirit absorption spell and that there was an imminent danger that others like you could start popping up every second. The other spirits were so scared of your spell at the time that they bought their arguments easily, but I always did think there was something off about their explanation."

"Mhm..." Arraka says. "In fact, one of the main reasons why they needed to send the other females along with me is because Memphir didn't know of a way to banish me, specifically, from the magical plane. Believe it or not, as long as you know what you're doing, it is actually easier to tamper with the Magium to banish half of the spirits from the civilized races to another plane of existence than it is to single out just one spirit and send that one to the earthen plane. You only need access to a tremendous amount of energy, which was provided of course by all of the idiotic spirits that they were able to con."

"If what you say is true, then this information may well turn our whole world on its head..." Jirinn says. "The war that would be started because of this could cost thousands of lives. Maybe tens of thousands. Is this what you are after? Do you want us all to kill each other for your entertainment, because you are no longer here to do it yourself? Why do you think I would agree to be part of such a scheme?"

 "Don't be like that, Jirinn..." Arraka says. "If you were any other spirit, I would preach to you about the injustice of all the female spirits that have essentially been sentenced to death for the wrong reasons, but you and I both know what you really want. You want there to be chaos just as much as I do. Maybe even more than me. Isn't that the real reason why you founded your little group of 'enlightened' warriors? At first, you were fighting against the gods, but when I began my rampage, you immediately switched targets and began going after me. Now, you may have fooled the others into thinking that you were doing this for the right reasons, but I think you know very well that this was never the case. The real reason why you wanted to hunt me down was because you liked the challenge of it. You were only fighting the gods initially because you perceived it as a hopeless battle, but when I showed up, you immediately recognized my strength and decided to oppose me instead. Tell me, what have you been doing these last few thousands of years? Have you ever managed to recreate the feeling that you got when you were fighting against me and my allies? Has there ever been a moment when you have felt more alive than then?"

"...No," Jirinn says. "After your banishment, I did go back to fighting the gods, together with my enlightened warriors, but as you say, it was never quite the same. Eventually, my group disbanded and in the following years the gods gained more influence than ever. There is hardly anyone left who challenges their supremacy now, and even for someone as me, it would be nothing short of suicidal to openly oppose them at this point."

 "You see?" Arraka says. "That is exactly what I was talking about. What you are now is only a hollow shell of your former self. What I am granting you is the opportunity to go back to your days of glory. As soon as you will let everyone know the truth, there will be a great divide forming between the gods' factions. This will make them weak, and it will provide you with the much awaited chance to reorganize your enlightened group, and to once again become a force to be reckoned with. Think about it. Is this not what you've been looking for your entire life?"

"You are still as shrewd as ever, I see," Jirinn says. "At least I know that all those years spent on the earthen plane did not make you any less cunning. Hmm... I will have to think about what you told me... You will provide me, of course, with undeniable evidence to support your claims?"

"Naturally," Arraka says. "I even met Selkram a week and a half ago, so I can personally confirm that the spirits are indeed still absorbed by him. Verifying this fact will be trivial."

"You met with Selkram?..." Jirinn asks. "How?"

"He materializes on the earthen plane for a short while every time when he does his rituals," Arraka says. "That's how I was able to speak to him. Anyway, before I give you all the details that you need, I have one additional matter to discuss with you. It is about the human who is linked to you. The one that you spoke to earlier."

"You can't be serious..." Jirinn says. "Are you really going to ask me to help this... primitive creature?"

"You would be helping him, of course, but in doing so, you would also be helping yourself," Arraka says.

"What are you talking about?" Jirinn asks.

"Haven't you noticed something strange going on with your magical powers in the past... let's say, forty-five years or so?" Arraka says. "Have you not found it harder to concentrate on casting spells, for instance? Or maybe your magic has not been as strong as it used to be?"

"Yes, but... I assumed that it was all happening because of my old age," Jirinn says. "Are you telling me that all of the problems I've had for the last half of a century were because of my link to that earthen creature?"

"Indeed," Arraka says. "Oh, but don't even think about trying to undo the link, because I guarantee you that it can't be done. Best case scenario, you will only end up hurting yourself by removing it. Worst case scenario, you may well end up dead."

"So, what do you propose, then?" Jirinn asks.

 "The reason why you and the human in question are both having trouble with your magic is most likely because the link was done incorrectly," Arraka says. "We already know that his soul's aura had this particular problem, so the chances are very high that the same thing happened with the link between the two of you. Illuna, you told me that Flower had some sort of medicine to fix Daren's nausea in the ethereal plane. Can you tell me what the medicine was meant to do, exactly?"

"I don't know if this means anything to you," Illuna says, "but Flower told me that the purpose of the medicine was to align the spinning essence with the spiraling blob. Isn't that right, Flower?"

"Yeah, that's what it's for," Flower says.

"Okay, so in other words, the link is slightly out of position," Arraka says. "Jirinn, I believe that for someone of your skill, it should be easy enough to do the appropriate readjustments as long as you know what to look for, correct?"

"I think so..." Jirinn says.

"Perfect!" Arraka says. "Then I recommend that you get to work immediately. If you get started now, you should normally have it done by tomorrow morning."

"What is this... morning you speak of?" Jirinn says.

 "I can see that your complete lack of interest for anything that goes on in the earthen plane has not changed one bit since the last time I spoke to you," Arraka says. "To answer your question, a morning on the earthen plane is when the sun first rises in the sky, and when a new day begins. Do you remember how a long time ago, after the gods began to heavily involve themselves with the people of the earthen plane, we began to borrow their time measurement units, like days, hours, minutes and years? Well, a full day is measured as the time between two sun rises, and a year is the time that it takes the large spherical earthen object that we are currently standing on to rotate around the sun. Or at least that's my theory around it. Most people here seem to think that the sun is the one rotating around us and that the earth we are standing on is just one long flat surface, so I try not to discuss this topic with them in order to preserve my sanity."

"Hey, Daren, did you hear that?" Hadrik says. "Arraka thinks that we're standing on top of some big sphere that spins around the sun. HAHAHAHAHA!"

"See, this is exactly why I don't talk to them about such things," Arraka tells Jirinn, while Hadrik is still laughing loudly in the background. "It's a complete waste of my time and energy."

"You seem to be on quite friendly terms with these... humans," Jirinn says. "The Arraka I knew would have never been joking around with earthen creatures or asked a former enemy for help on their behalf. What has changed?"

 "A lot of things have changed, Jirinn," Arraka says. "A lot of things. Either way, I think we've held you long enough. Once I've given you all the details that you need regarding my soul absorption technique, we'll leave you alone, and then we'll contact you again in a day or two, so you can give us some update on your progress concerning the matters that we've discussed. Hopefully, it will be only good news. Oh, and make sure that you don't let anyone know of the fact that we've been in contact with each other. I don't want any of the gods to know that I'm the one secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes."

"Right," Jirinn says. "Let's hear those details, then. I'm all ears."

For the next twenty minutes or so, Arraka gives Jirinn a very thorough explanation on how the soul absorption process works, and why the wrong application of her technique can lead someone to permanently speak in multiple voices, as is the case for Selkram and Ulruk. She then also takes the time to teach him how to use the same basic version of her technique that she taught the banshees on the earthen plane, so that he can properly understand what she's talking about.

 Once Arraka makes sure that Jirinn has been given enough evidence to believe her side of the story, she begins to discuss with him a very elaborate plan on how to expose the God of Death and the God of Time in front of all the other gods, in a way that would make it obvious for everyone that they have absorbed spirits in the past.

According to her, there is a way to temporarily awaken the spirits absorbed by Selkram and Ulruk from their long hibernation, but it can only be done for a very brief period of time, so it is important that there are as many witnesses as possible at that given moment.

In order to bring all of the gods together, Jirinn has agreed to contact them tonight and to falsely claim that he wants to pledge his loyalty to them tomorrow, before noon. Considering that he is the former leader of the largest and most powerful group that have opposed the gods in the past, such an offer will be hard for them to refuse, since his surrender would most likely greatly demoralize any spirits who still had any thoughts of resisting the gods' rule.

 In fact, the gods will almost certainly use this opportunity to invite as many spirits as possible, so they can make a public showing of Jirinn's humiliation. Once all the spirits are gathered together and Jirinn has their undivided attention, he will cast a soul awakening spell provided to him by Arraka, causing Selkram and Ulruk's absorbed spirits to cry out desperately for help in their old voices, so that anyone who personally knew them five thousand years ago would recognize them immediately.

Taking advantage of the ensuing chaos, Jirinn would then shout about how the gods have betrayed them, and how they have been secretly absorbing spirits to increase their powers for all these years. He would also then claim that the true reason why they banished Arraka and the other females of the civilized races was because they were afraid that they could become powerful enough to challenge their rule, and because they wanted to keep the soul absorption technique a secret, so that they alone would be able to use it.

 In the ideal scenario, Jirinn's speech should be enough to rally most of the spirits to his side, giving him the chance to escape while the gods would be too busy fighting amongst themselves to apprehend him. Thus, Jirinn would have the chance to form a new group of enlightened warriors in the next few days, while the gods would need to choose whether they'd want to side with Ulruk and Selkram or fight against them in the inevitable upcoming war.

Obviously, the ideal scenario is nowhere near guaranteed, and a lot of things could go wrong, but Jirinn definitely seems motivated enough to carry this through, no matter the risk. As we have already established, Jirinn will be giving us regular updates about the situation on the magical plane, although we've agreed not to contact him in the next two days, so as to avoid exposing him to any unnecessary risks by being caught having a conversation with us.

 As soon as the discussion between Arraka and Jirinn ends, we all decide to go to bed, since the moon was already pretty high up in the sky by the time everything was said and done. Luckily for me, I do not have any night shifts scheduled for today, so for once I am finally able to sleep uninterrupted until late in the morning.

 In the ideal scenario, Jirinn's speech should be enough to rally most of the spirits to his side, giving him the chance to escape while the gods would be too busy fighting amongst themselves to apprehend him. Thus, Jirinn would have the chance to form a new group of enlightened warriors in the next few days, while the gods would need to choose whether they'd want to side with Ulruk and Selkram or fight against them in the inevitable upcoming war.

Obviously, the ideal scenario is nowhere near guaranteed, and a lot of things could go wrong, but Jirinn definitely seems motivated enough to carry this through, no matter the risk. As we have already established, Jirinn will be giving us regular updates about the situation on the magical plane, although we've agreed not to contact him in the next two days, so as to avoid exposing him to any unnecessary risks by being caught having a conversation with us.

 As soon as the discussion between Arraka and Jirinn ends, we all decide to go to bed, since the moon was already pretty high up in the sky by the time everything was said and done. Luckily for me, I do not have any night shifts scheduled for today, so for once I am finally able to sleep uninterrupted until late in the morning.

When I wake up in my tent about ten hours later, I notice that my stat device is beeping next to me, although I'm not sure for how long it's been doing this. It looks like I've received some new points. It was about time.

 Once I am done with the stat booster, I change out of my pajamas, I put the device in my right pocket and then I walk out of the tent.

"So, I was thinking..." I hear the voice of Hadrik, as I leave the tents area and get closer to the river. "Arraka, you said yesterday that all the banshees learned to possess people from you or from spirits that were taught the technique by you, right? So what happens to all the other female spirits who get born into this world and don't know how to possess people?"

"They die," Arraka answers him, simply.

"But... you said that a part of the Magium is in charge of creating new spirits to balance out the ones who die, didn't you?" Hadrik says. "Does this mean that there are thousands of female spirits that are just reborn every day only to die over and over again? And this has been going on for five thousand years?"

 "Sort of," Arraka says. "First of all, they are not 'reborn' in the true sense of the word, since the new banshees that get created do not have the memories of the old ones that died. Secondly, the spirits do not die immediately after they are brought into this world. They usually fly around aimlessly for a few days at least before they inevitably succumb to their deaths. They don't have bodies, voices, or any real means to communicate with anyone from the earthen realm, but sometimes their presence is felt by certain people, who see them in their dreams or who can make out their shapes late at night. These spectral apparitions are typically referred to as ghosts. Oh, and it's not 'thousands' of female spirits that are reincarnated every day only to die, but rather tens of thousands, or even more than that."

"Tens of thousands?!" Hadrik asks, shocked. "And you are okay with this?"

"What is there to be okay with?" Arraka says. "I gave them a fighting chance, didn't I? I taught them how to survive. Now, the rest is up to them. And besides, it's not like I could have done much more for them even if I wanted to. I was trapped in a mountain for more than four thousand years, remember?"

 "Yes, but you said that you've been roaming free in animal bodies ever since the still winter and until you got trapped in the amulet twenty years ago," Hadrik says. "That's what... six hundred years, almost? You could have helped them during this time!"

"Help them to do what, exactly?" Arraka asks. "Kill all of your women and steal their bodies? You do realize that even with my soul absorption technique, someone still needs to die, right? With the exception of ethereals, it is not possible for a banshee's and her host's souls to live together inside the same mind. If anything, you should be thankful that I didn't teach more female spirits my soul absorption technique. Right now, the number of banshees in your world is very small, so they are still manageable due to the existence of banshee hunters, but if every single female spirit were to acquire a body, they would quickly drive your whole population into extinction. This could have been amusing for a while, sure, but a world that has been emptied of all its locals would likely get boring very quickly."

 "So, am I to understand that we have Arraka to thank for our world not being destroyed?"

"Of course you have me to thank for it," Arraka says. "Hell, I've practically been saving your world every day for the past six hundred years simply by choosing not to destroy it."

"I think you meant to say for the past five hundred and eighty years," Illuna says. "Unless you were implying that there was any possible way in which you could have threatened to destroy the world from inside that amulet."

"You would be surprised," Arraka says.

"I'm sure I would," Illuna says, in a dismissive tone.

#if(v_b3_ch10_destroyed == 1) {
 "Why are you assuming that the earthen races would lose against the banshees?"

"Why do you think?" Arraka asks me. "It's obviously because every spirit from the magical plane can cast magic, while on your plane of existence only mages can do that. If you also add to this the fact that the average spirit is likely going to be better at magic than the average mage from the earthen plane, the outcome is easy for anyone to predict."

"Yes, but you forget that we have non-mage warriors and assassins who can use enchanted weapons and also tinkerers who can create magical devices," I say. "So, it's not necessarily only the mages that the banshees would be fighting."

"Hah!" Arraka says. "If you think any of those shmucks would stand a chance against a magical spirit, then you haven't been paying attention."

}
#if(v_b3_ch10_destroyed == 2) {
 "Why do you think that there are so few banshees out there right now?"

"Well, one of the reasons is clearly the existence of banshee hunters, which I only just mentioned," Arraka answers me. "Then there are also some white mages who specialize in purifying women before the banshees possessing them are fully awakened, so I imagine that many spirits are killed by them as well. But most of all, I think it's because the banshees that I've taught my soul absorption technique to initially haven't really done a very good job at making sure that this knowledge got properly passed on to future generations. Considering that so many banshees do not even know that they need to target the host's soul with the spell instead of their body, I shudder to think what other information may have been passed on incorrectly along the years."

"And you've never had the curiosity to find the spirits who are spreading the wrong information in our current day and age so that you could set them straight?" I say.

"Nope," Arraka says. "Like I said: it's not my problem anymore."

}
 "Hey, Barry, do you have a minute?" Melindra says, from somewhere behind me. "I need to talk to you about something in private."

"Oh, hi Melindra," I say. "I didn't know you came back. Sure, I've got a minute."

I then follow Melindra away from the others, while Hadrik and Arraka continue their conversation in the background.

"Look, I wasn't suggesting that you should let the banshees kill all the women," Hadrik tells Arraka. "I was thinking that maybe you'd find some other way to help them out."

"Well, I could put them out of their misery a little faster than the time it takes them to die on their own, if you want," Arraka says. "Would that be helpful enough for you?"

"Damn it, you know what I meant!" Hadrik says.

 As soon as we get out of earshot of everyone else, Melindra begins to speak, with a rather serious look in her eyes.

"Barry, you've known Kate for longer than I have..." she says. "How do you think she'd react if she felt... somewhat betrayed by someone whom she considers to be her friend?..."

"We're talking about a purely hypothetical scenario here, of course?" I ask her, knowing full-well that she was in fact referring to herself.

"Yes, yes... purely hypothetical!" Melindra says.

"Well, to answer your question," I say, "the last time when Kate thought I had betrayed her, she pinned me against a tree and put a knife to my throat."

"Oh..." Melindra says, in a tone suggesting that this wasn't exactly the answer she would have liked to hear. "And, umm... how did you manage to convince her that it was a misunderstanding?"

"Look, if you're not going to tell me anything specific, I won't be able to help you," I say. "What was it that you did which Kate might consider to be an act of betrayal? Does it have anything to do with those lessathi that you are acquainted with?"

"It's... more complicated than that," Melindra says.

"When she put the knife to my throat, she thought I was in league with the lessathi too, because of my lineage," I say, "but we managed to work things out, eventually. I'm sure you can too. As long as you're sincere about it, I see no reason why Kate wouldn't--"

"Hey guys, we're back!" Daren shouts from a distance, as he and Kate are slowly approaching us. "We've got good news! Where's Hadrik? I want him to help me try out something."

"I guess not..." Melindra says.

 "I asked Kate if she could fly around on her ice platforms and throw rocks at me from all angles," Daren says. "I managed to block them all with my magical barrier. It's amazing! I never thought that my shield spell would ever work this well in my lifetime!"

"Nice!" I say. "So this means that Jirinn, or whatever his name was, fixed the link between the two of you, right? How strong do you think your shield is against physical attacks, compared to what you can do against magic? Is it anywhere near that level?"

"That's what I intend to find out," Daren says, as he now reaches me and begins to shout for Hadrik. "Hey, Hadrik, can you come out here for a second? I want to test something!"

 "Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there," we hear Hadrik's voice, and then he walks out from behind the trees and into the clearing that we were in.

"What's going on?" Hadrik asks Daren, as he gets closer to us and Flower is now coming towards us as well, with Arraka's amulet around her neck.

"Hadrik," Daren says, "I want you to hit me as hard as you can. Give me your best punch. Come on!"

As he is saying this, Daren is taking a defensive stance, with his shield in front of him and his semi-transparent barrier surrounding him.

"As hard as I can?" Hadrik says. "I don't think this is such a good idea."

"Nonsense," Daren says. "I can take it. Show me the best you've got!"

 "Okay, here's how we're gonna do this," Hadrik says. "I'll start with one of my weaker punches first and if you can handle that, we'll move up from there. Does that sound good to you?"

"Fine, fine, but hurry up," Daren says. "I am shivering with anticipation."

"Alright then," Hadrik says, as he readies his punch. "Here we go!"

As soon as Hadrik's fist hits Daren's shield, there is a loud clanging noise from when he hits the metal, but despite the rather considerable force that Hadrik seems to have put behind his 'weaker' punch, Daren didn't move one inch from his original position.

"Well, I'll be damned!" Hadrik says, with a grin. "Okay, Daren, you've convinced me. I'm going to give you one of my best punches. You'd better not disappoint me!"

"I wouldn't dream of it," Daren tells him.

This time, Hadrik brings his arm all the way back, in order to make sure that his next attack will live up to Daren's high expectations. When his fist finally hits Daren's shield again, the sound that the shield makes is so loud that it makes all the birds fly from the trees, and the noise just keeps on going for about another ten seconds, while the shield vibrates continuously from the strength of the punch.

Daren was pushed back around thirty inches or so by the impact of the hit, but for the most part he stood his ground, and unless he sustained any non-visible injuries that I am unaware of, he seems to be completely unharmed.

 "Hahahaha!" Hadrik laughs. "So, this is what the healer in armor is like when all of his limitations have been removed! I've been dreaming of a moment such as this. The moment when I could finally test my powers against a world-renowned hero who is able to fight me at his full strength. How about it, Daren? Would you be interested in ditching this training session and going for a full-on sparring match instead?"

"I was actually going to ask you the same thing," Daren says. "Just give me a minute, so I can get out of this armor."

"Oh?" Hadrik says. "This should be interesting!"

It takes him about two minutes or so, but with a little help from us, Daren manages to take all the pieces of his plate armor off, leaving himself dressed only in a short-sleeved dark-green tunic that he was wearing underneath, a pair of brown pants and his boots. Once everything has been prepared and the rest of us are out of the way, the fight can finally begin.

The first thing that Hadrik does is to dash straight for Daren, to see if he can overwhelm him with his inhuman speed. Normally, I would have expected Daren to use his newfound ability to block the dwarf's attack head on, but instead what he does is that he casually steps out of the way, even if he shouldn't have had any time to react to that without his reflexes somehow being magically enhanced.

 "You thought I wouldn't expect a surprise dash right at the beginning of the battle?" Daren says, with half a grin. "Come on, Hadrik! You know me better than that! I've been watching you fight for weeks. You're going to have to be a little more unpredictable if you actually want to win this."

"Hah!" Hadrik says. "I should have known that you wouldn't let me end the fight so quickly. But what if I do this?"

He then jumps towards Daren, trying to hit him with his fist again, but Daren steps out of the way once more, making it look as if he were expecting this attack as well. Seeing that surprises don't seem to work on his opponent, Hadrik decides instead to strike many times in quick succession, in order to give Daren as little time as possible to outmaneuver him.

To all of our surprise, Daren's moves flow like water from one another, avoiding one punch after the other, without letting himself get hit even once. His new style of combat looks like a combination between the style of his old master Nolderan... and that of Eiden.

"I see that Daren is combining his many years of combat experience with what I taught him about auras in order to read his opponent's moves and predict his attacks before they happen," Arraka says. "Not bad. Maybe I didn't waste all that time teaching him for nothing."

 After seeing that none of his attacks are connecting, Hadrik decides to change his strategy a little and to employ the same tactics that he used against Gontrok in their last battle, changing his body size and proportions constantly in order to confuse his dueling partner. From what I can tell, this does seem to be having an effect on Daren, likely because he hasn't really had the chance to see Hadrik fight in this new style for very long, making it a lot harder to predict. After a few very close calls, Daren is eventually forced to go on the defensive, blocking a lot more hits with his shield than he did before.

On the other hand, Hadrik isn't letting Daren's sword get anywhere near him, knowing full-well that it could easily cut through his aura hardening and his tough giant skin even if Daren is not aiming for any of his weak points. This carefulness of his around Daren's weapon makes some of his strikes weaker than they should be, due to him being caught on the wrong footing half of the time.

"It looks like it won't be long now until Daren concedes," Kate tells us.

"What are you talking about?" Flower says. "Why would he give up? He's totally winning!"

"He looked like he was winning at first, but not anymore," Kate says. "As soon as he started going on the defensive, the fight was lost for him."

 Hadrik and Daren's battle went on for a long while, just as Arraka predicted, and the two of them were indeed evenly matched for the entirety of their duel, however what nobody could have predicted was that the fight ended by Daren conceding, because he was getting hungry and Hadrik was too stubborn to end the match in a draw.

While this was not exactly the outcome that I had in mind when I made the bet with Kate, I am a man of my word, so I decided to uphold my end of the bargain and to abstain myself from eating any of Flower's delicacies for the rest of the day.

Once Flower was done making food out of thin air for everyone except me, we all began to eat our meals, while discussing our plans for the rest of the day.

The only thing that I'm not certain of is if he will get out alive or not after he holds his little speech, rallying everyone against the gods. Eh...

 "What the--" Daren says, as he immediately gets up from the ground and his plate falls from his lap. "You mean to say that you sent that arrogant prick on a suicide mission while knowing full-well that his death would mean the loss of my magic?! What were you thinking?"

"Relax..." Arraka says. "If it does happen, then it will only be a temporary setback. Usually, it doesn't take more than a day for someone to link themselves subconsciously to another spirit if the one that they were already linked to ends up dying. And even if you link yourself wrong again, we'll just have a talk with this new spirit and tell him to fix it. One day without magic won't kill you. You still have your enchanted weapon, shield and armor, so it's not like you'll be defenseless or anything."

"Yeah, but I only just got used to fighting without my armor again!" Daren says. "Do you have any idea how long it's been since I could move so freely, without all that heavy metal dragging me down? Damn it, I really hope that bastard of a spirit doesn't get himself killed."

"He'll be fine," Arraka says. "He is one of the few who survived after making me into his enemy, so at the very least I can personally vouch for his resilience."

"Daren, may I ask what you're planning to do with your armor, now that you're not going to wear it anymore?" Melindra says. "From the looks of it, most of those pieces of armored plate are too big to fit into your backpack. Surely, you're not planning to just leave them here, are you?"

 "Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me!" Daren says. "Hey, Hadrik, I've been wondering this for a while now, but that backpack of yours is not currently at its real size, is it? You once told me that you paid extra money on its enchantments so that it could hold hundreds of dwarven ale bottles inside it and prevent them from breaking, but even so, I can't imagine that any enchanter worth his salt would allow for so many items to be stored inside such a small backpack, since it would put way too much strain on it."

"You're right," Hadrik says. "One of the backpack's enchantments makes it change its size along with me, as long as I wear it when I shapeshift. It's the same type of enchantment that I have on my clothes, armor and boots. In reality, the backpack's size is much bigger."

"I knew it!" Daren says. "In that case, can you do me a favor? Would you mind changing your size temporarily, so I can fit my armor inside your backpack? It would be a real pain to have to strap all of these pieces to my backpack so I can carry them..."

"Hmm..." Hadrik says. "Well, the gnome king told me that I wouldn't be allowed to turn into a giant for the duration of this tournament, but I suppose that if I shapeshift into a slightly bigger size only for a short while, it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Alright, consider it done!"

"Thanks a lot!" Daren says. "This really takes a load off my mind. So... when are we leaving? Melindra, did you finish your negotiations with that friend of yours who has the pinecone detector? When can we meet them?"

 "Umm, soon!" Melindra says, looking a bit uncomfortable. "Very soon! There are just... a few last-minute arrangements that I need to take care of, and then we'll be on our way."

"Right..." Daren says, in a somewhat unconvinced tone. "Well, take as much time as you need. Just make sure to not forget about the enchanter's oath. So far it hasn't been acting up in any way, but it might have some sort of negative reaction if the spell considers that you are stalling too much."

"I know," Melindra says. "I haven't forgotten. I'll... make sure that there are no unnecessary delays that could cause trouble with the spell."

"As long as you understand, it's fine," Daren says. "Anyway, we should hurry up and finish eating. To be honest, I'm still a little bit pissed about how my fight with Hadrik ended, so I'm kind of itching for a rematch."

"Hey, I offered a compromise, didn't I?" Hadrik says. "I said we could eat while still fighting. You're the one who surrendered out of the blue before we could talk things through!"

"Yeah, yeah," Daren says. "Whatever you say, Hadrik. Don't worry, this time there won't be any more interruptions, so I'm sure that we'll have a clear winner soon enough."

 After we're all done eating, Daren and Hadrik both get ready to begin round two of their battle, like they said they would. However, just as they are about to start, a new spectator suddenly joins us, teleporting right next to our group, while acting as casually and nonchalantly as we've come to expect from him by now.

"What's the matter?" Eiden asks us, with his eyes closed as always, after we all stare at him for a few seconds without saying anything. "There's no need to stop the fight on my account. By all means, please continue!"

"Eiden again..." Daren says, and then he sighs. "I see that you're still walking around with your eyes closed, dressed in pajamas as if you've just gotten out of bed. Some things never really change, do they?"

"These aren't pajamas," Eiden says. "They are high-quality fabric made from the finest of silks. They used to be quite popular six hundred years ago. Melindra, I'm surprised that you've travelled so long with them and you haven't told them this by now."

"Hmph," Melindra says, as she crosses her arms and turns her face away from him, with a pout. "I'm not talking to you."

"Now, now, is that any way to treat an old friend?" Eiden says, as he walks closer to her.

"You're not my friend," Melindra says. "Friends don't ignore each other in their time of need. You even went as far as casting a silencing spell on me in the Thilias arena and making me look like an idiot when I was talking to you. Don't think that I'll ever forget that!"
