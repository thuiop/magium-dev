 "Were the buildings in this city always so weird?" I ask Melindra. "I'm honestly surprised that some of these structures haven't collapsed, yet."

"There were houses like this in the city before I was kicked out, but not as many as there are now," Melindra says. "They must have demolished some of the older houses in order to build the new ones on top of them. It's probably the work of Billy Bob, the rogue lessathi that I was telling you about earlier. He kind of fancies himself a genius in every domain, including architecture, and the king has been giving him a lot of liberties, as a reward for his invaluable contributions towards this city's sudden and abrupt technological advancement. As a result, old Billy Bob has taken the opportunity of experimenting with all kinds of wild and innovative designs for buildings, some of which are a little more questionable than others."

"Excuse me, but did you just say this lessathi's name is Billy Bob?..." Daren says.

"Oh, that's not his real name," Melindra says. "That's just what we used to call him because his name was nearly unpronounceable. His full name is Biliborrathrathsarran, and since the first few syllables kind of sound like Billy Bob, that's the nickname he ended up with."

"I guess his parents really went all out when they named him, huh?" Hadrik says.

 "Honestly, it doesn't sound that much more ridiculous than your typical lessathi name, to me," Melindra says. "It's just the length of it that's really exaggerated. There were just so many ways in which they could have shortened the name to turn it into something more manageable, that it makes me think his parents simply named him like that as a cruel joke. What better way to ruin your son's life than to give him a name that-- hey look, a flying golem head!"

"What?..." Hadrik says.

"Over there, look!" Melindra says, as she points towards a strange contraption that is currently flying towards us.

This 'flying golem head' seems to be nothing more than a metal ball the size of a human head, with a propeller on top and a sort of large eye in the center, which appears to be illuminated by a red light. As the flying metal ball gets closer to us, it turns itself left and right, so that its eye can get a good look at us, and then it begins speaking in a metallic-sounding monotone voice.

"This unit does not recognize you," the flying ball says. "Identify yourselves."

 "Oh, this brings back so many memories!" Melindra says, as she looks at the metal ball in front of her. "I remember how Billy Bob had an obsession with these one-eyed golem heads. He wanted to make them intelligent! I believe he used to call them... droons? Yeah, I think that was the name. Anyway, so Billy Bob had this dream that he could one day fill the skies with these 'droons' of his, and that they would somehow monitor the citizens even in the absence of the city guards. Needless to say, his dream remained only a dream, and the most he managed to get out of these old relics was to get them to ask for your name. If you don't answer them, they'll keep pestering you until you tell them something. But if you give them any name whatsoever, they'll simply fly away and leave you alone. How's that for a useless invention?"

"This unit shall not repeat itself again," the flying metal ball says. "Identify yourselves, or face the consequences!"

"Wait, was that it?" Hadrik says, as the metal ball flies away from us. "Isn't it going to ask for the rest of our names?"

"I did say that these 'droons' aren't exactly very intelligent, didn't I?" Melindra says.

"Yeah, but still..." Hadrik says. "Is it just going to call us all Felran from now on, or what?"

 Instead of giving the metal ball an answer, I pull my dagger out and stab it in the eye. The flying ball squirms for a little bit while making some strange monotone noises, but then the light from its eye fades, the propeller slowly stops moving, and the so-called 'droon' crashes to the ground, lifeless.

"Huh..." I say. "I was kind of expecting some sort of defense mechanism to activate, or something."

"I told you," Melindra says. "These flying contraptions are completely useless. They're nothing more than a waste of space. Anyway, it doesn't really matter. Now that the 'droon' is dead, it shouldn't bother us anymore. Let's proceed, shall we?"

}
#if(v_b3_ch2_name == 4) {
 "I say we simply ignore it," I tell everyone. "I see no reason why I should give this flying contraption my name."

"You can't ignore it," Melindra says. "It's just going to keep bugging you until you give it a name."

"Let's just keep going towards the castle, shall we?" I say.

Melindra shrugs.

"Suit yourself," she says.

She then goes back to leading the way, as we all slowly move to follow her.

"This is your last warning!" the metal ball says from behind, as it keeps flying after us. "Identify yourself, or you will face the consequences."

"How many last warnings does this thing give, anyway?" I say. "Didn't it also say last time that it would 'not repeat itself again'?"

"These are all empty threats," Melindra says. "It's just going to keep giving you last warnings until you say something. I'm telling you, there's no way around it."

 "Refusing to identify yourself is a direct violation of the law," the flying ball says. "State your name now, or you will deemed a criminal!"

As the metal ball keeps pestering us, more and more of the citizens we are passing are turning around to look towards us, with somewhat worried expressions on their faces.

"We're drawing too much attention to ourselves with this thing following us," Daren says, and then he turns towards the metal ball. "Hey you! Flying contraption! My name is Daren. Do you understand? Da-ren!"

"Designation acquired," the metal ball says. "You will henceforth be referred to as Da-ren. Have a pleasant day."

"Wait, was that it?" Hadrik says, as the metal ball flies away from us. "Isn't it going to ask for the rest of our names?"

"In order for this unit to be able to properly guide you through the city, you will first need to specify your intended destination," the metal ball says.

"Negative," the metal ball says. "All merchants coming from foreign cities are our esteemed guests. It is this unit's job to ensure that your business is conducted as smoothly as possible. However, in order to guide you, this unit will first need to know where you are headed."

"And what if we don't give you our destination?..." Daren says.

"Well, damn..." Hadrik says, as the metal ball is flying away from us. "I was almost sure that the blasted contraption would sound the alarm after everything it just said. Do you think there's any risk that the golem head will tell anyone else about that whole 'analysis'?"

 "I don't know, but I don't like the way everyone is looking at us," Daren says, as he nods his head towards a few citizens who are watching us from a distance, with slightly anxious expressions on their faces. "I'm not sure how much these people heard of what the golem head just said, but we'd best be moving along before we become even more suspicious-looking than we already are."

"So, how do you reckon that metal ball figured out all that stuff about us?" Hadrik asks Daren in a low voice, as we move away from the people who were staring at us.

"It's possible that they've been monitoring us since before we entered the city," Daren says. "Melindra did say that these 'droons' were originally built for surveillance purposes, and I will admit that I haven't really been paying attention to the sky above us since we came here."

"But if they knew what we were doing from even before we got past the gates, why would they let us come this far?" Hadrik says.

It's anyone's guess, really. There's not exactly much we can do about it other than keeping our guards up, and hoping for the best.

"Calculating your chances of success for assassinating the king of Ollendor," the metal ball says. "Calculation complete. Unfortunately, your odds of successfully completing such a task are very low. Would you like to hear a more detailed analysis?"

"Uhm, sure..." I say. "Why not?"

"Given your group's estimated level of strength, the most likely outcome is that you will be defeated by Ollendor's royal guard before you can reach your target," the metal ball says. "There is, however, a scenario in which you could stall them for long enough to assassinate the king, although you would likely still be killed soon afterwards." 

"And what is this scenario?" I say.

 "You would need to take advantage of the ever-growing tensions between the old members of the royal guard and the newer members, who only joined recently, during the Magium tournament," the metal ball says. "Some of the older members are currently suspecting that the new ones only sought to be recruited into the royal guard so that they could gain easy access to the treasury and steal from their kingdom. The leader of the group in particular is always keeping an eye on the new members, and he makes sure to never let them walk around unsupervised. If you were to generate an internal conflict within the ranks of the royal guard by using this information, your chances of success would slightly increase."

"You don't say..." I tell the 'droon'. "What about any other scenarios in which we could stall the royal guard? Do you have any more useful advice to give us?"

"Unfortunately, the Overseer protocol does not have any more information to offer you regarding this subject," the metal ball says. "Keep in mind that the Overseer protocol is still experimental, and therefore it may not always be able to give you the exact guidance you require.

 "Not too long," Melindra says. "We should probably get there in the next few minutes."

Just like Melindra said, it didn't take too much time for us to get to the Perrelion plaza, and as soon as we reached our destination, we realized that there were quite a lot of people gathered up there, standing in place, as if they were all waiting for something.

"Do you guys think there's some sort of spectacle scheduled around this time?" I tell my friends as we make our way through the crowd.

"Could be," Daren says. "They may also be waiting for some high ranking official to give a speech at this hour. Whatever it is, it shouldn't really concern us. Let's keep moving."

All of a sudden, a very large magical holographic screen appears in front of the crowd, floating a few dozen feet above the ground, so that everyone can see it properly. On the screen, we see a fat man with a gray beard wearing a crown and royal garments who I'm assuming is the king of Ollendor, a man wearing blue robes holding a scepter who is likely the city's high priest, serving the God of the Seas, and an eighteen year old boy wearing pajamas, holding his hands in his pockets and keeping his eyes closed, while having a polite smile on his face.

"Damn it!" Daren says, as he takes a look at the screen. "Not him again..."

As if he'd heard him commenting, Eiden looks straight at Daren through the screen with his eyes still closed, and he smirks at him.

 "Did you see that?" Daren says in a low voice, so the other people in the plaza won't hear him. "He was looking right at me when he smirked! How did he hear what I said? Do you think they are somewhere nearby?"

"Be serious..." Arraka tells Daren. "He didn't need to hear exactly which words you used to figure out what you were going to say. You say the same thing every time Eiden makes an appearance. All he had to do was use his magical sense to figure out where you were situated in relation to the screen, and then read the fluctuations in your aura to figure out when you were done talking, so he could smirk at you. You would know these sorts of things if those 'ex-sage' teachers of yours had spent a minimum amount of time giving you aura training exercises instead of teaching you how to pick daisies."

"I swear," Melindra says, "if Eiden is planning to give away our position to the king after he didn't even bother to say hello to me at the arena in Thilias, I am going to strangle him with my own hands."

 "He's not giving away anything," Illuna says. "Look at the screen. They're clearly preparing for a ceremony of some kind. The king and Eiden are both staying silent, while the man in robes is chanting obscure mantras and smacking the ground repeatedly with his scepter. I recommend that we ignore them and keep following Melindra towards our destination. This ceremony of theirs is probably going to take a long time."

"Yes, well, you see..." Melindra says. "The thing is that it's been a while since I last visited this plaza, and I don't really remember which way we're supposed to go from here. They've changed so many things with the architecture that nothing looks the same anymore, and it's all very confusing. Just... give me a minute, and I'm sure I'll figure it out."

After we walk for a few more minutes, we start to notice that a lot more metal balls with propellers on top are slowly gathering in the air above, and that they are all flying in one big circle. No matter how fast or how slow we're moving, the metal balls are always making sure that they're positioned right above us, although aside from following us, they don't seem to be doing much else. At least for now...

"Melindra," Kate says, "is it normal for the flying golem heads to behave in this way?"

"No, I've never seen them act like this before," Melindra says. "It looks like they're preparing for something. But I'm not sure exactly what."

"We haven't seen any guards since we got past the gates, and I'm noticing that there are fewer and fewer civilians the further we move into the city," Daren says. "Logically speaking, there should be at least some sort of ambush waiting for us soon. Don't you think that these flying contraptions are also a part of the ambush in some way?"

"I don't know," Melindra says. "I've never seen them attack anyone before. As far as I'm aware, they shouldn't have any offensive capabilities, but it's been a long time, so things might have changed since the last time I saw them."

#if(v_premonition < 3) {
 "They could still be transmitting our position to the other guards, so they can better know where to wait for us," Daren says. "I think it would be safer to take all the metal balls out before we go any further. Kate, could you do the honors?"

Kate nods, and she then starts preparing about twenty or so icicles in the sky above her, so she can shoot all of the flying golem heads at once with them.

Kate nods, and she then starts preparing about twenty or so icicles in the sky above her, so she can shoot all of the flying golem heads at once with them.

All of a sudden, I see a premonition in which the metal balls swiftly dodge almost all of Kate's icicles, and before any of us can react, the 'droons' dive down upon us, attacking us with various types of magical beams and projectiles.

"Wait, don't shoot!" I shout loudly, and Kate stops her icicles just in time.

"What's wrong?" Kate says.

"I saw a vision of you attacking the metal balls, and they're going to just dodge most of your projectiles," I say. "They'll also start shooting us with all sorts of magical attacks as soon as we open fire on them, so if we're going to take them out, we'll need a better surprise attack than that."

"Flower and I could also ready up some fire arrows and water lances, in order to shoot the metal balls right as they try to dodge Kate's icicles," Illuna says. "No matter how good they are at evading attacks in mid-air, I doubt they'd be able to avoid three consecutive waves of projectiles."

As soon as the icicles are ready, Kate shoots them towards all of the metal balls at once, aiming for their eyes. However, in an unexpected turn of events, most of the flying golem heads manage to dodge Kate's icicles easily, and they're now diving down towards us, while shooting various types of magical beams and projectiles out of their red eyes.

I quickly fly away, narrowly avoiding getting hit by an ice beam from one of the golem heads, and then I pull out my crossbow, hoping that I can take out the metal balls before they get a chance to overwhelm me with their attacks. The ones using electric and acid attacks seem the most dangerous to me, so I decide to target them first.

Unfortunately, before I even get to take my first shot, I suddenly realize that the flying golem heads have completely stopped going after my friends, and now every single one of them is coming towards me, instead. They must have been instructed to prioritize airborne targets over ground ones. Lucky me.

I try to head back towards the ground, but the metal balls have me completely surrounded, and they're coming at me from below as well.

Kate and Flower have already begun shooting down some of the golem heads, but they weren't fast enough. Before I even got a chance to move, one of the metal balls stunned me with an electric attack, while another one melted my entire head with a spray of acid, in a matter of seconds.

 While Kate and Flower are shooting down the golem heads as fast as they can, I am forced to rely exclusively on my reflexes for a while in order to keep myself alive. This does not help me for long, though, because no matter how fast my reactions are, I am still limited by the small delay with which the air currents react to my movements.

I try to shoot down a few of the metal balls myself, but their flying patterns are too hard for me to predict, and eventually a beam of fire engulfs my head, killing me in a matter of seconds.

I therefore decide to buy some time, by shooting down some of the metal balls as well. Aiming while dodging in mid-air is definitely not easy, but I somehow manage to accurately predict the flight patterns of some of the golem heads, and by taking them down, I get to stay alive just enough for Kate, Illuna and Flower to finish off the rest of our enemies.

"I guess that's that for the 'droons', then," Daren says, as he looks at all of the metal balls now on the ground.

"Only for the ones that were following us," Melindra says. "There are likely many more of them roaming around the city, which haven't come to greet us just yet."

"Out of sight, out of mind," Daren says. "Frankly, I'm more worried about the guards that are trying to set up an ambush ahead of us. From what I'm sensing, it seems that they're trying to block off our other escape routes as well. Shaking them off is going to be a little tricky."

"Maybe Daren should make a barrier for us first, just in case."

"Good thinking," Daren says. "Those contraptions might try to retaliate if they see us preparing to attack them. Everyone, come here and I'll shield you."

We move closer to Daren and then he raises his shield, creating a protection barrier around us. Once we're safely inside, Kate unleashes all of her icicles upon the flying metal balls, aiming for their eyes. However, in an unexpected turn of events, most of the flying golem heads manage to dodge Kate's icicles easily, and they're now diving down towards us, while shooting various types of magical beams and projectiles out of their red eyes.

"Damn it..." Daren says, as his barrier is slowly beginning to crack under the pressure of the constant barrage of spells coming its way. "There wasn't enough time for the barrier to regenerate after the battle with the large golems at the gates. At this rate it won't hold out for much longer. Try to finish this as quickly as you can!"

 As Daren's barrier is getting bombarded with more than a dozen spells, ranging from ice and fire beams to acid sprays and electric attacks, Kate sends a second wave of projectiles towards the golem heads, while Illuna and Flower are also attacking them with fire arrows and water lances. They manage to take out about half of the flying metal balls by themselves, but judging by the multitude of cracks visible on the surface of Daren's semi-transparent barrier, it looks we only have a few seconds to go until it collapses completely.

"The barrier is about to break!" Daren shouts. "Be ready!"

Just as the barrier is about to disappear, we all move away in different directions, in order to split up the golem heads that were focusing us. A few of the metal balls come after me and I try to fly away from them, but somehow the only thing that I accomplish with my actions is to attract the attention of even more golem heads, which are quickly moving to follow me.

I attempt to dodge their attacks, but there are just too many of them and I quickly get overwhelmed. Before my friends manage to save me, I get hit by two fire beams at the same time, which kill me in an instant.

 "Well, well, well," Arraka says. "Look who's finally learned to spot an ambush through the use of magical sense. Maybe all those aura training sessions weren't a complete waste of time after all."

"Some of our escape routes only have a few sentries posted at the exits," Melindra says. "We should be able to overpower them easily."

"Yes, but then they'll announce our position to all of their friends, and they'll come right after us," Daren says.

"Still better than to be caught in an ambush," Melindra says. "We're invading a city here... We can't exactly expect to not encounter any resistance."

"I suppose not," Daren says. "Alright, let's take the most direct path to the palace that avoids the ambush, then. Which way do we go?"

"This way," Melindra says, as she heads down a small deserted alleyway. "Follow me."

It doesn't take us long to find the two guards stationed at the end of the alley, and to see that one of them has a transceiver in his hand. We incapacitate the two of them quickly and we move on ahead, hoping that they didn't get the time to notify their friends of our position before we knocked them out.

Unfortunately, we soon find out that we might have been a bit too optimistic, as the guards that were setting up the ambush earlier are all now running towards us, and at this rate, it should not take them too long to reach our position.

 "What now?" Hadrik says. "Do we stand here and fight them?"

"No," Daren says. "We'll try to delay them as much as we can. Flower, can you cast a wall of fire that is long enough to cover the width of this street? It should take them a while to find a way around it, and that will give us a bit of time to distance ourselves from them."

"Yeah, sure," Flower says, as she conjures a wall of flames behind us, just like Daren said.

"Perfect!" Daren says. "Let's keep going."

"There's still another group of guards approaching us from that other alleyway over there..." Melindra says, as she points towards the entrance of an alleyway that intersects with the one that we're currently on.

Before anyone gets to comment anything, Kate heads over to the alleyway Melindra mentioned, and she shoots a beam of ice out of her hands, freezing the ground completely.

"There," Kate says. "The ground is frozen solid. Unless they've brought ice skates with them, it's going to take them a long while to traverse this passageway. Shall we move forward?"

"Very well," Melindra says. "We'll be reaching the Perrelion plaza soon. Once we're there, we'll decide which path to take towards the palace."

 Just like Melindra said, it didn't take too much time for us to get to the Perrelion plaza, and as soon as we reached our destination, we realized that there were quite a lot of people gathered up there, standing in place, as if they were all waiting for something.

"Do you guys think there's some sort of spectacle scheduled around this time?" I tell my friends as we make our way through the crowd.

"Could be," Daren says. "They may also be waiting for some high ranking official to give a speech at this hour. Whatever it is, it shouldn't really concern us. Let's keep moving."

All of a sudden, a very large magical holographic screen appears in front of the crowd, floating a few dozen feet above the ground, so that everyone can see it properly. On the screen, we see a fat man with a gray beard wearing a crown and royal garments who I'm assuming is the king of Ollendor, a man wearing blue robes holding a scepter who is likely the city's high priest, serving the God of the Seas, and an eighteen year old boy wearing pajamas, holding his hands in his pockets and keeping his eyes closed, while having a polite smile on his face.

"Damn it!" Daren says, as he takes a look at the screen. "Not him again..."

As if he'd heard him commenting, Eiden looks straight at Daren through the screen with his eyes still closed, and he smirks at him.

 "Did you see that?" Daren says in a low voice, so the other people in the plaza won't hear him. "He was looking right at me when he smirked! How did he hear what I said? Do you think they are somewhere nearby?"

"Be serious..." Arraka tells Daren. "He didn't need to hear exactly which words you used to figure out what you were going to say. You say the same thing every time Eiden makes an appearance. All he had to do was use his magical sense to figure out where you were situated in relation to the screen, and then read the fluctuations in your aura to figure out when you were done talking, so he could smirk at you. You would know these sorts of things if those 'ex-sage' teachers of yours had spent a minimum amount of time giving you aura training exercises instead of teaching you how to pick daisies."

"I swear," Melindra says, "if Eiden is planning to give away our position to the king after he didn't even bother to say hello to me at the arena in Thilias, I am going to strangle him with my own hands."

 "He's not giving away anything," Illuna says. "Look at the screen. They're clearly preparing for a ceremony of some kind. The king and Eiden are both staying silent, while the man in robes is chanting obscure mantras and smacking the ground repeatedly with his scepter. I recommend that we ignore them and keep following Melindra towards our destination. This ceremony of theirs is probably going to take a long time."

"Yes, well, you see..." Melindra says. "The thing is that it's been a while since I last visited this plaza, and I don't really remember which way we're supposed to go from here. They've changed so many things with the architecture that nothing looks the same anymore, and it's all very confusing. Just... give me a minute, and I'm sure I'll figure it out."

"I suspect we will soon find out," Kate says. "The priest looks like he is almost done with his preparations."

After smacking the floor two more times with his scepter, the man in blue robes steps back, and he makes way for the king of Ollendor to step to the front.

"My beloved people!" the king says. "As I've announced yesterday, our Creator has finally returned. I've spoken to him yesterday, and he has gracefully agreed to participate in this ceremony, in order to receive the blessing of the God of the Seas, just like every other citizen of Ollendor. Once he becomes one of us, I'm certain that he will guide us to new heights, and together with him we will no longer need to fear any of our enemies!"

}
 "Actually, oh great and wise king," Eiden says, "my role for now will be that of an observer, rather than an active participant in your politics. I have reasons to believe that your kingdom will face a great challenge in the near future, and I am very interested to see how you and your people will handle this crisis. I have heard many praises about your skilled leadership, and I am most anxious to witness your decision-making process up-close. I am confident that you will not betray my expectations."

"Of course, Creator!" the king says. "Whatever this crisis may be, I will make sure that you won't be disappointed. High priest, you may begin the ceremony!"

As soon as the king gives the signal, the priest begins chanting again, and both the king and Eiden fall silent once more.

"I knew it..." Daren says. "That bastard knows exactly what we're planning to do, and the only reason why he came here is to get a better view of the show. He's just going to sit there, sipping his tea, while the rest of us murder each other for his amusement."

"As long as he's not planning to interfere in any way, he can drink as much tea as he wants, for all I care," Melindra says. "Let's just hope that he won't get bored of watching and decide to join in the fun, later."

 As Melindra begins to concentrate on remembering the right way towards the palace, I can feel the air currents around me disappearing, likely because she can no longer maintain her focus on them.

"At least we won't have to worry about being attacked here, with all these civilians standing around," Hadrik says, as he looks at all the people gathered in our area. "What do you all suppose this ceremony is about, anyway?"

"I suspect we will soon find out," Kate says. "The priest looks like he is almost done with his preparations."

I've spoken to him yesterday, and he has gracefully agreed to participate in this ceremony, in order to receive the blessing of the God of the Seas, just like every other citizen of Ollendor. Once he becomes one of us, I'm certain that he will guide us to new heights, and together with him we will no longer need to fear any of our enemies!"

 When we get a little closer to the margin of the plaza, Melindra suddenly signals us to stop, and she begins watching the entrance to an alleyway in front of her very attentively. As we try to understand what got her attention, we see that three men are currently entering the plaza, two of which appear to be participants in the tournament, given that I'm not seeing any warnings to not injure them.

The three of them are wearing similar looking blue-colored uniforms on top of their armors, although the man who is a local from Varathia seems to have different markings drawn on his garments, likely as a result of being higher ranked than the others. Of the two tournament participants, one of them is particularly bulky and tall, reminding me somewhat of Bruce from the Thilias arena, except that he has a long black beard, a bald head, the look of a seasoned war veteran in his eyes, and he does not appear to be holding any weapons.

The second tournament participant is dark-skinned, although his skin tone is of a lighter shade than that of Daren and his ex-mentor. He has short black hair, he seems to be in his early thirties, and he has two long swords hanging from his belt, which indicates that he's likely using a dual-wielding combat style when he fights.

 The man who is of higher rank is also the oldest one in the group, looking like he's over sixty years of age, with long white hair and quite a few wrinkles on his face. Just like the bulky man in their group, he is not holding any weapons, although if I were to take a guess, I'd say that's because he probably uses only magic when he fights, as opposed to his muscular companion, who most likely prefers to fight with his fists.

As the men notice us, they begin to slowly head in our direction, while looking straight at us.

"By the looks of those uniforms, these are likely the king's royal guards," Melindra tells us in a low voice. "Be cautious. They're all heavily suppressing their auras, so I can't tell just how strong they are."

"Well, if it isn't my good old friend, Hadrik!" the bulky man says, with a smirk. "Somehow, I had a feeling that you'd also be participating in this tournament."

"I think he just wants to see how things will play out. I doubt he'll join in."

"I think you might be a little too optimistic, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see how things play out," Melindra says. "Anyway, let's forget about Eiden for now. I'm pretty sure that I figured out which way we need to go next. Come over here."

We all go after Melindra, who leads us towards one of the edges of the plaza where there are considerably fewer people standing around.

As we distance ourselves from the crowd, a short conversation between two people in an alleyway catches my attention.

"Everybody can see that the ceremony's already started," one of the voices says. "Quit your whining. Nothing's going to happen if we're just a little late." 

"Are you forgetting that it's your fault we ended up arriving late in the first place?" the second voice says.

"Nobody forced you to come with me while I was shopping," the first voice says. "You could have gone ahead without me."

"As if I'd be crazy enough to let you out of my sight for even a minute," the second voice says. "You may have fooled all the others, but I know you can't be trusted. As long as you're under my direct command, you'll be doing exactly as I say. Is that understood, temporary recruit Gondrok?"

"Whatever you say, captain," the first voice says, and then they both fall silent.

You're not seriously going to tell me you still resent me for that thing with the dwarf village from all those years ago, are you? Then again, I suppose you wouldn't be the Hadrik I knew if you didn't hold endless grudges for the most insignificant things imaginable."

Gontrok then laughs heartily, as Hadrik is looking like he could easily murder his old 'friend' right here and now.

"I take it that you know this dwarf, recruit?..." the higher ranked man says.

"This man is no dwarf, captain," Gontrok says. "He's a giant, just like I am. He probably got ordered by one of the tournament organizers to stay in his dwarf form if he didn't want to get kicked out, just like they told me to stay in my human form. All giants who want to travel outside their home country need to learn shapeshifting magic to make themselves smaller, or they won't be accepted into other societies."

As I hear the two men talk, I suddenly realize that they are the same captain and recruit that I heard arguing earlier, while they were still in the alley. With a little luck, maybe I'll be able to use what I found out from their private conversation to my advantage later.

 Gontrok then pushes his feet into the ground, and the stone-paved street cracks beneath him as he makes a quick dash towards Hadrik, reaching him in less than a second. Hadrik instinctively jumps back, and away from our group, but Gontrok goes right after him, and he attempts to punch him in the stomach with his left fist. Hadrik immediately tries to block the hit, but it turns out to be a feint, which Gontrok used to force his opponent to leave his upper half undefended. The giant immediately seizes the opportunity, and he grabs Hadrik by the head with his right hand, smashing his face against the ground with so much strength that the impact creates a small crater and sends pieces of rock flying in all directions.

Gontrok does not wait for Hadrik to recover, and while he is still firmly gripping his head in his hand, he throws the dwarf into the air, waiting for him to fall back down, and then he kicks him so hard that he sends him crashing through ten rows of houses, launching him so far away from us that we can't even see him anymore. Seeing the fight that has broken out right next to them, a lot of the citizens that were surrounding us are now running away, screaming in terror.

 In the meantime, Kate has already begun attacking the captain, sending around a hundred icicles in his direction, but all of them stop in mid-air just as they reach him, then they turn themselves around and launch themselves right back at their creator, with breathtaking speed. Kate manages to conjure a wall of ice in front of her fast enough to defend herself from the incoming barrage of icicles, but the captain then makes a quick motion with his right hand, and somehow, an invisible force suddenly pushes Kate to the ground, restricting all her movements, similarly to how Eiden and the God of Time immobilized us during our first encounters with them.

Flower tries flying upwards with her fire jets, but the invisible force pushes her down as well, and it keeps crushing her against the ground, completely immobilizing her. Before the captain gets to do anything else, however, Leila dashes towards him, forcing the old man into close-quarters combat, which is quite clearly not one of his specialties. Unable to dodge Leila's relentless attacks, the captain is forced to repel her with the same invisible force attacks that he used before, although this apparently causes him to lose his grip on the spells that were holding Kate and Flower down, which allows them to somewhat raise themselves from the ground and to start working on a counter-attack.

 As everyone else is fighting, the dark-skinned guard stays true to his word, and he only watches everyone from afar, leaning against a wall with his arms crossed and with a rather unimpressed look on his face. Gontrok, on the other hand, is now slowly approaching Daren and me, while Hadrik is still nowhere to be found.

"Stay behind me, Barry," Daren says, as he raises his shield up.

"Hey, I know you!" Gontrok says. "You're the healer in armor. Wow, this is great! I've always wanted to test my skills against a world-renowned hero. Let's see how well those legends will hold up against the might of a real warrior, shall we?"

He then runs towards Daren, and he attempts to punch him directly, but the healer in armor anticipates his movements and steps to the side, letting the giant punch only empty air. Before Gontrok regains his footing, Daren quickly counter-attacks with a well-timed slash of his blade, although it seems that he wasn't fast enough, and somehow his adversary still had enough time to make a big jump backwards, and to get away unharmed.

"That's not half-bad!" Gontrok says, as Daren rushes towards him. "But it's going to take more than that to defeat a giant."

 As my body is shivering uncontrollably, I suddenly feel several air currents beginning to flow around me, and for some reason, the feeling of the wind moving slowly against my skin has a weirdly calming effect on me, which helps me to regain my composure and to stop my trembling. I immediately realize that this is Melindra's flying spell, and as I turn around to face her, she gives me a very serious look, and she nods her head towards Daren, who is still being kicked around by Gontrok.

She's telling me to go help him. But how? 

As I look around myself to see what I could possibly make use of, I notice that Daren's sword is simply lying on the ground, ripe for the taking. Yes... with a weapon like this I should definitely be able to hurt the giant. That is to say, as long as I can manage to land a hit...

From what I understood, the problem they're having is that the captain thinks Gontrok and the other guy are planning to steal from their treasury.

Gontrok is, however, much too fast for me, and he manages to close the gap between us in less than a second, grabbing my head in his right hand.

So long as I never attack him, I'm not giving him any openings to exploit, and so he is forced to play this waiting game with me, unless I make a mistake.

As I finally manage to distance myself a little more from him, I suddenly feel a very powerful invisible force pushing me to the ground, while restricting most of my movements. I struggle to move my head to the side, in order to see what's going on, and I realize that while I've been fighting the giant, Leila had also been subdued and now everyone who was fighting the captain earlier is being pushed against the ground, unable to get back up.

"Just what exactly do you think you're doing, captain?..." Gontrok asks, as he gets closer to me.

"What's the matter, hero?" Gontrok says with a malicious grin, as he kicks Daren in the stomach once again just when he was trying to get back up. "Isn't this supposed to be the part where you defy the odds and make a spectacular comeback? Don't disappoint me like this... I was having such high expectations of you!"

"If you want to have a proper duel, then come here!" I say, as I grab Daren's sword from the ground and look towards the giant. "I assure you that I'll make it worth your while."

"I'm not sure who you're supposed to be, boy, but a challenge is a challenge," Gontrok says, as he turns away from Daren, and begins heading in my direction. "We'll see soon enough if you're all talk or not."

The giant then makes a dash towards me, but before he can reach my position, I soar up high into the air and out of his grasp.

"Oh, now I get it!" Gontrok says. "You think that by attacking me from above, you can gain the advantage. You have no idea how wrong you are..."

The giant then spontaneously sprouts two dragon-like wings from his back, which he immediately uses to propel himself upwards at an alarming speed.

 Damn it... He only partially shapeshifted himself in order to keep his giant's strength and durability, while taking advantage of a wyvern's high mobility. I didn't even know such a thing was possible. So much for my aerial superiority, I guess...

As Gontrok approaches me, I quickly realize that his wings grant him a far higher mobility than the one I get from Melindra's flying spell.

The only way I could compensate for this would be to react quicker than him, whenever he attacks me, but unfortunately my reflexes are nowhere near good enough for this to happen, and so the giant soon catches up to me, grabbing me with one hand by my shirt and punching me so hard in the face with the other, that he completely shatters my skull and kills me in an instant.

I manage to get out of his way several times, but the delay with which the air currents react to my movements eventually makes it too hard for me to rely simply on my fast reaction speed to avoid his attacks. Luckily for me, my combat technique stat also gives me access to evasive tactics that I can use while airborne, and this allows me to outmaneuver the giant well enough that it makes his higher mobility become irrelevant. I fly through the sky for a while, trying to bait Gontrok into attacking me without exposing myself to too much risk, but my tactical advantage does not last for long, because unfortunately the giant was not the only enemy that I needed to look out for. 

 When I reach a somewhat lower altitude, I suddenly feel a very powerful invisible force pushing me downwards, and I soon find myself crashing into the ground, completely unable to move. While I am still trying to raise myself from the ground without any success, Gontrok lands somewhere close beside me, retracting both of his wyvern wings until they disappear completely, and he looks at his captain, with a resentful look in his eyes.

"Just what exactly do you think you're doing, captain?..." Gontrok asks.

I move my head a little so I can take a better look at my surroundings and I realize that while I've been fighting the giant, Leila had also been subdued and now everyone who was fighting the captain earlier is being pushed against the ground, unable to get back up.

As he's preparing to kick Daren once again, Gontrok suddenly gets a much more serious expression on his face and he instinctively turns to face me, likely because for the first time in this battle he actually sensed that his life was in danger. It barely took me more than a second to dash towards Daren's sword, pick it up and then make a beeline for the giant with my weapon pointing towards him, but somehow he was still able to react in time and step to the side, just as I was about to run him through with my blade. Gontrok doesn't let me regain my footing and he immediately grabs me by my right arm, squeezing it very hard.

"It's not nice to attack people while they have their backs turned to you..." Gontrok says, with a dark look on his face, as he now squeezes my arm even harder, in an attempt to make me drop the sword. "Maybe I should teach you a lesson, by making sure you will never be able to use this arm again."

The pain of him trying to crush my arm is excruciating, but I can easily tell that my bones would have been completely broken by now, if my toughness level weren't so high. I clench my teeth and I spin around, kicking Gontrok in the gut with the back of my left heel, which makes him lose his grip on my arm and sends him flying about a dozen feet backwards, before he lands on his back.

 I immediately dash towards him and try to stab him while he's still lying on the ground, but the giant quickly rolls to the side, dodging my sword by a mere few inches. He then gets back up and lunges at me, in an attempt to grab me one more time, but I do a little spin and then try to stab him once again, which forces him to do a quick jump backwards, only to come back and attack me even more relentlessly one second later. I decide to take advantage of my high speed to confuse my enemy, and I attempt to distance myself from the giant, in order to run circles around him until he can no longer focus on me properly.

As soon as I try to put my plan into action, however, I immediately realize that Gontrok is in fact just as fast as I am, if not even more so. Every time I try to jump away from him, he closes the gap between us in an instant, and it is only thanks to my incredible reflexes and extensive knowledge of combat techniques that I am able to both react in time and predict his next movements, in order to get out of his way in time. The two of us jump around the battlefield for a good few seconds before I conclude that this strategy isn't going to work, and as soon as I find a bit of an opening, I soar high into the air, in the hopes that I'll be able to finally get the better of him by taking advantage of my aerial superiority.

Unfortunately for me, the giant does not let me distance myself from him more than a few dozen feet before he spontaneously sprouts two dragon-like wings from his back, which he immediately uses to propel himself upwards at an alarming speed.

 Damn it... He only partially shapeshifted himself in order to keep his giant's strength and durability, while taking advantage of a wyvern's high mobility. I didn't even know such a thing was possible. So much for my aerial superiority, I guess...

What follows is an intense battle of wits and aerial maneuvering, as each one of us tries to get the upper hand on their adversary by attempting to anticipate their movements. Once again, it seems that my piloting skills are paying off, because for the most part, I appear to be the one driving Gontrok into a corner and not the other way around. That being said, I still can't seem to be able to land a hit on him, and as the battle prolongs itself I am getting increasingly worried that the giant might decide to pull another trick out of his sleeve, so he can gain the upper hand yet again.

As I reach a somewhat lower altitude, I suddenly feel a very powerful invisible force pushing me downwards, and I soon find myself crashing into the ground, completely unable to move. While I am still trying to raise myself from the ground without any success, Gontrok lands somewhere close beside me, retracting both of his wyvern wings until they disappear completely, and he looks at his captain, with a resentful look in his eyes.

 "What's the matter, hero?" Gontrok says with a malicious grin, as he kicks Daren in the stomach once again just when he was trying to get back up. "Isn't this supposed to be the part where you defy the odds and make a spectacular comeback? Don't disappoint me like this... I was having such high expectations of you!"

"Damn it, Gontrok!" I say. "What the hell are you doing?! Attack him now, while he's distracted!"

"What are you blabbering about?..." Gontrok says, as he turns towards me and leaves Daren alone for a second.

"The captain!" I say. "Did you forget all about our plan? You said we should keep the captain busy so you could finally rid yourself of him. Well, now's your chance! Your captain is more vulnerable than ever! So, what are you waiting for? Go kill him!"

"Do you really think that such a weak lie could possibly be enough to--" Gontrok starts saying, but all of a sudden, both he and I find ourselves getting pushed to the ground by an invisible force, which makes it impossible for us to get back up.

As I move my head a little so I can take a better look at my surroundings, I realize that Leila, Kate and Flower have been immobilized as well, and neither of them can get back up either, no matter how hard they try.

"Just what the hell do you think you're doing, you moron?..." Gontrok says, as he struggles in vain to set himself free from his captain's spell.

 "Silence!" the captain says. "It's already difficult enough for me to focus on immobilizing everyone without having to figure out whether you're actually trying to betray me or not. Loyrang, come here and finish these intruders off, will you? I'm afraid that if I move away from this position, I might break my concentration and undo the spell."

"I already told you that unless the king himself orders me to do it, I'm not going to attack any of these people," says the dark-skinned guard, whose name is apparently Loyrang.

"So, now you are working against me as well?" the captain says.

"We're not working against you, you imbecile!" Gontrok says. "We can't even attack any of the locals because of the tournament's protection spell. How exactly would we even go about harming you?!"

"These outsiders should be under the effects of the tournament's spell as well..." the captain says. "And yet, that didn't seem to stop them from attacking me."

"You know what?" Gontrok says. "You're right. Maybe that tournament spell never even existed. Maybe it was all a hoax from the beginning, just to scare us into not attacking any of the civilians. In fact, I feel like testing this theory right now."

 The giant then puts both his hands on the ground, and he pushes with such strength that the stones crack beneath him, while he manages to slowly raise himself up, with great difficulty. He then begins walking very slowly towards the captain, as every single one of his steps creates a small hole in the ground, due to all the pressure that is currently pushing him down.

"Just watch me!" Gontrok shouts very loudly, as he keeps advancing towards his captain, while clearly struggling to hold himself in an upright position. "Tournament spell or not, I am going to come over there and smash your teeth in, you arrogant son of a whore. I will show you what it means to mess with someone like-- wait did anyone else hear that?..."

All of a sudden, Gontrok turns to his right, putting his hands in front of him, and barely a moment later Hadrik flashes right past me, reaching his old friend in less than a second and punching him so hard that a shockwave of air hits us all in the face, when his fist collides with Gontrok's palms. Even though he did successfully block the attack, Gontrok does not manage to completely nullify the effects of the impact, and he gets thrown straight into a wall.

"You sure managed to knock me out cold for a while, there, Gontrok..." Hadrik says. "Luckily, your loud shouts from earlier were just what I needed to get woken up!"

 "What does it look like I'm doing?" the captain says. "I've immobilized your opponent, and everyone else for that matter. Hurry up and finish him off, so you can come kill these other ones too. I would kill them myself, but I'm afraid I might break my concentration if I move too much from this spot."

"You sicken me," Gontrok tells the captain, with a disgusted look in his eyes. "I'm not going to kill some defenseless enemy who can't even fight back. That is not how we giants do battle."

"Please tell me that you are joking..." the captain says. "You know what? Never mind. I don't want to hear the answer to that question. Loyrang, come here and finish these people off, will you? This idiot giant cannot be reasoned with in any way."

"I already told you that unless the king himself orders me to do it, I'm not going to attack any of these people," says the dark-skinned guard, whose name is apparently Loyrang.

"You people are unbelievable!" the captain shouts very loudly. "Do you seriously not understand the basic concept of what it means to be a guard?!"

"If you want to kill them so badly, then you can come over here and do it yourself," Gontrok says. "I'm not going to help you with your pitiful-- wait, did anyone else hear that?..."

 All of a sudden, Gontrok turns to his right, putting his hands in front of him, and barely a moment later Hadrik flashes right past me, reaching his old friend in less than a second and punching him so hard that a shockwave of air hits us all in the face, when his fist collides with Gontrok's palms.

"You sure managed to knock me out cold for a while, there, Gontrok..." Hadrik says. "Luckily, your captain's shouts from earlier were just what I needed to get woken up!"

"And here I was, thinking that you'd gone soft during all those years that you've been away," Gontrok says, as he raises himself from the ground and begins walking towards Hadrik. "Perhaps you are still fit to entertain me after all. Let's see what you've got, 'old friend'."

As soon as Gontrok stops talking, he runs towards Hadrik, and then the two of them clash once more. Meanwhile, the captain seems to have given up on trying to get his teammates to help him, and he is now very slowly trying to advance towards us, holding in his right hand a small dagger that he had been keeping hidden until now.

 This is very bad. Neither of us can move at the moment, so no matter how long it takes him to reach us, as long as he gets here, we'll be completely defenseless against him. Melindra has not been immobilized, but she cannot attack the captain at all, because he is a local, and Daren seems to have been injured too severely to be able to heal himself right away.

As the captain stops for a little bit, to make sure that he does not accidentally break his concentration on the spell that's pushing us down, Arraka, who had been notably silent until this point, finally snaps.

"What the hell is WRONG with you people?!" she shouts. "Is this what I've been training you for? To get offed by a frail old man, crawling towards you with a small dagger? Were you not going to challenge the gods?! How can you all be so incredibly useless?"

"This frail old man is using a spell that I've only seen being cast by Eiden and the God of Time before!" I say. "Are you seriously going to claim that we're fighting just some plain old mage, here?"

 "He's not using a spell, you cretin!" Arraka says. "He is using aura manipulation! He expanded his aura so that it would cover this whole area, and then he started crushing you with it. There's even an easily recognizable focal point floating in the air in front of you that he's using to help him control his aura fluctuations. It's right over there, look! Do you want me to color it for you?"

All of a sudden, a small sphere made of a red colored light appears in front of us, several feet above the ground.

"There it is!" Arraka says. "Now sharpen your elements and shoot it. Shoot it!"

Kate does not wait for Arraka to ask her again, and she immediately sends an ice cone straight at the red orb of light floating in the air. As soon as it is hit, the red ball of light vanishes, and I can already feel the pressure above me weakening, although it is not completely gone. Leila is the first one who manages to break herself free from the invisible force pushing her down, and she immediately starts putting pressure on the captain again, as the rest of us are still trying to get back up.

Just as we were about to break ourselves free as well, we feel the air becoming heavy above us, and once more, we get pushed against the ground.

"Damn it!" Arraka says. "He made another focal point, but he's moving it around, and I can't color it properly. This would be so much easier if you numbskulls could see it for yourselves. Well, at least the mute girl is still in the fight, so our efforts weren't completely wasted."

 While Leila is fighting the captain, we can feel the invisible force above us becoming weak and then powerful again, as the old man is struggling to maintain his concentration. In the meantime, Hadrik and Gontrok are still fighting, and it looks like Gontrok is winning again, but the fight does seem to be more evenly matched this time around.

As we're all still trying to raise ourselves up from the ground, we suddenly hear an explosion coming from the holographic screen, where the ceremony was still being displayed.

"What was that?" the king of Ollendor says, in a slightly panicked tone. "Where did that explosion come from?"

"It sounded like it came from inside this very building, my lord," the high priest says.

"By the gods!" the king says. "Then this must be related to the great challenge that our Creator said we would be facing soon!"

"Actually, this isn't--" Eiden begins to say, but the king interrupts him.

 "Do not worry, Creator!" the king says. "We will show you that our kingdom is strong enough to face any danger! In fact, I will call upon my most skilled guards, so that this problem will get solved as quickly as possible. You see, I have this device here in my pocket which I am to use only in the case of an extreme emergency, and as soon as I press on this button, all of the royal guards will be teleported near my position."

"No..." Gontrok says, in disbelief. "He wouldn't!"

"Interrupt the transmission!" the king says, as he presses on the button of his device. "We'll have to resume the ceremony at some other time."

As the big holographic screen slowly disappears, the three royal guards are all being enveloped by a white light, which means that they are only seconds away from being teleported out of the area.

"Damn it!" Gontrok says, as the white light surrounding him is becoming more intense. "You stupid king! I can't believe--"

Before the giant gets to finish his sentence, he and the two other guards all get teleported away from us, and as a result, the invisible force that had been pinning us to the ground finally disappears. As we get up, Hadrik begins to walk towards us, and when he approaches us we see that he is full of bruises, and that one of his cheeks is red and swollen.

"So..." Hadrik says. "An explosion, huh? I wonder what that was all about..."
