"Barry, I would like to have a word with you, in private," Kate tells me, as the four of us are taking a small break near a river.

I knew this was coming. I've been expecting it ever since we had that discussion about my stat device two hours ago. She barely spoke a word to me after that, and the look she's been giving me for the past hour has been sending chills down my spine. Whatever the reason for her sudden change of attitude towards me, I can't let things go on like this. We need to clear this up, one way or the other.

"Alright," I say. "Lead the way."

Kate goes on ahead and I start to follow her, but before I take my first step, Daren grabs me by the shoulder.

"Remember, Barry... Three taps."

The look in his eyes is dead serious. I realize he's talking about the magical transceiver he gave me last night, which I'm still carrying in my pocket. He told me to tap it three times in case I'm in danger. I guess he must have also noticed that something was wrong with the way Kate's been acting for the past two hours. 

 I nod to him and he lets go of me. I then go on to follow Kate, who is heading deeper into the forest. We walk in silence for about a minute. 

"How far are we going, exactly?" I ask her, but she gives no answer and continues to walk forward.

After about another minute, she finally stops and turns to me, with the same cold look in her eyes that she's been giving me ever since we fought the dragon.

"Are you planning to tell me what--"

Kate doesn't let me finish my sentence and suddenly makes an ice dagger appear in her right hand, which she then almost immediately puts to my throat. I try to step back, but I realize there's a tree right behind me. She is now pressing her blade hard against my throat, and I can feel a trickle of blood running down my neck, as my back is being pushed against the tree's trunk.

"If you make any kind of noise, I will slit your throat here and now. Do you understand?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about. Who is Diane?"

"Damn you!" Kate shouts furiously at me, while tears are starting to form in her eyes. "Damn you to hell! I trusted you! Both you and Rose! Was this all part of your plan to recapture me? Were you trying to get close to me so that you could catch me off-guard? Is Rose working with you too?"

 "Because I'm in love with you!"

When Kate hears my words, she punches the tree behind me so hard that it leaves a big dent and her knuckles start bleeding. I can see her literally trembling with rage.

"Is everything a joke to you?!" she shouts at me.

Suddenly, there's a sound coming from my pocket, and this time it's not my stat device.

"Barry, are you okay?" says Daren through the magical transceiver. "Are you still there?"

I tap the device with my left hand in order to activate it, and answer him.

"Yes, Daren, I'm fine. I'm just having a longer discussion with Kate. I'll let you know when we're done."

"Oh, okay, then. I didn't mean to interrupt, I was just starting to get worried, that's all. Take your time."

"What was that?" Kate asks me, as I turn off the transceiver.

It's funny. She's still holding her dagger at my throat as she speaks to me, but I find myself to be unusually calm about all of this. I wonder if it's because of everything I've been through since I joined this tournament yesterday.

 "That was a device that Daren gave me to communicate with him in case of an emergency," I tell her.

"What?... No, that can't be right. We never talked about this during our strategy meetings. Why wouldn't he have also given me a device like this if it's for emergencies?"

"That's because Daren doesn't trust you."

"But you said--"

"I'm sorry, Kate. I was afraid that you wouldn't believe me if I told you the truth. The fact of the matter is I am the one that convinced Daren to not perform the purification ritual on you when we first met."

"No... You're lying!"

"Am I? Aren't you the one who said that Daren never looked at you as if you were a human being?"

Kate hesitates.

"Why would you of all people--"

"It's because of my sister, who turned into a banshee a long time ago. That's how I knew you were different."

"Do you really expect me to believe--"

She stops, when she sees the look on my face. She must have realized I'm being serious this time around.

 "Because I helped you when we were attacked by the crossbowmen this morning. If I wanted you either dead or captured, that would have been the best time for me to seize the opportunity."

Kate is looking like she may be taking my words into consideration, although there is still doubt in her eyes.

Suddenly, there's a sound coming from my pocket, and this time it's not my stat device.

"Barry, are you okay?" says Daren through the magical transceiver. "Are you still there?"

 "It happened fifteen years ago," I tell her. "My family and I were living in a rather isolated village, where people didn't really know much about banshees and mages in general. When my sister started gaining magical powers, we were all overjoyed, because we thought we had a mage in the family. Then one night..."

I start getting flashbacks of the night when my sister turned into a banshee. It feels as if her sinister laughter is still ringing in my ears.

"One night, I came home to find the bodies of my parents lying in pools of blood, with my sister standing above them. Only it wasn't my sister anymore. Everything was different about her, even her magical aura. She was just about to kill my younger brother, when I picked a pitchfork from the ground, and impaled her with it. I was lucky. The banshee had just awakened, which made her vulnerable. If I had arrived even a few minutes later, I don't think anyone would have been able to stop her anymore."

I pause, and then look Kate straight in the eye.

 "Daren's transceiver is made so that I can let him know when I'm in danger by simply tapping it three times. I could have done that the moment you put your dagger to my throat, but I didn't, for the same reason I didn't refuse to go alone with you in these woods, despite the obvious risks. It's because I wanted to talk things through with you, and make sure that we clear things up between us. Now, tell me, Kate, do you still think I'm saying all of this just so I can gain your trust in order to capture or assassinate you?"

Kate's hand holding the dagger is starting to tremble, and the fierce determination she had in her eyes is slowly dying down. She lowers her dagger, and her gaze turns towards the ground on her left side.

"No, I don't," she answers me. "I'm... really sorry. For everything..."

"That's beside the point! I was ready to slit your throat at a moment's notice. And now you're telling me that we should just forget about this and act like nothing happened?!"

"Okay, I admit, maybe I exaggerated a bit. I didn't mean it like that. I was just saying that we should let bygones be bygones and move on."

"Why?! Why are you still willing to trust me after all that's happened? What's wrong with you? Are you completely out of your mind?"

"Of course I am! Surely, you must have realized this when you found out about the true reason I joined the tournament." 

 She's now looking at me as if she can't believe the words I'm saying.

"So..." I tell her as I hold out my hand to her. "Are we still friends?"

Kate looks like she's still recovering from the shock of what I've just said.

"Friends?... How can you even say such a thing after what just happened? Don't you understand that you're putting yourself in danger by travelling with me?"

"So what? How would travelling with you be any more dangerous than having to fight a stillwater and a dragon in the same day? At least if you're coming with us, I'll feel safer, knowing that you're watching my back."

"You're an idiot," she tells me as she grabs my hand and squeezes it firmly.

Suddenly, a layer of ice forms itself around me and it binds me to the tree behind me.

"This ends now," Kate says, as she pulls her dagger back from my throat, and prepares to give me the finishing blow.

I desperately try to free myself from the block of ice, but the only part of my body that I can still move is my head. Daren, where are you?

"This is for Diane, you bastard!" Kate shouts at me as she swings her ice dagger towards my face.

Her arm stops a few inches from reaching me, and her hand holding the dagger starts to tremble. She looks me straight in the eye and tries to move her arm forward, but she can't bring herself to do it. Her rage is slowly fading away while she looks at me, and her eyes are beginning to water up again. As she stands there with the knife in her hand, the grip she has on her weapon starts to weaken, and eventually it drops to the ground, along with a stream of tears flowing down from her face.

 "I'm sorry..." she says to me, crying. "I'm so sorry... For everything..."

"That's enough, Kate," I hear Daren's voice, as he reveals himself from behind a tree. "Surrender now, and I won't have to hurt you."

"Daren, wait--" I start to say, but he cuts me off.

"I'm sorry, Barry, but now that it's come to this, I can't just let it slide. She's too dangerous to be left alone. I'm going to purify her."

Kate wipes the tears from her face, and regains her cold look, as she turns to Daren and starts to speak.

"Don't sound so disappointed, Daren. We both know that you've been waiting for this moment ever since you first laid eyes on me. And we both know that surrendering is just not in my nature."

 Kate conjures a platform of ice beneath her, and she uses it to raise herself into the air, and out of Daren's reach.

"Come back here and fight fair, damn it!" Daren shouts after Kate as she goes further up.

Once she reaches a sufficiently high point of altitude, she starts raining down swords of ice upon Daren, while he defends himself with his shield. His defensive barrier seems to be holding up a lot better than it usually does against normal weapons. None of Kate's ice swords are getting through it, even though she's attacking him from all directions.

Daren is now raising his sword into the air,  and moving it in a steady circular motion. As his sword moves, I can see the air starting to spin around it at great speed. Once he stops rotating his sword, he slashes powerfully towards Kate, generating a strong gust of wind that blows her off her ice platform.

She manages to quickly conjure an improvised slide of ice below her and immediately after she lands on the ground, she turns towards Daren with her palms pointing at him. A beam of ice shoots from her hands and heads straight for Daren, who is now holding his sword in front of him. The beam hits his sword head on, but instead of getting frozen, the weapon absorbs the energy from the attack and starts radiating a cold magical aura.

 Daren then slashes his sword at Kate, which sends the ice beam right back at her. She manages to get out of its way in the nick of time and attempts to retaliate, but Daren, who had already reached her, slashes his sword at her left ankle, making her drop to one knee. She tries to attack him with a beam again, but all she manages to do is point her palms at him, while the ice refuses to come out of her hands. The block of ice she trapped me in is also starting to slowly melt away.

"No..." she says in disbelief.

"I'm afraid that won't work anymore, Kate," Daren says. "You won't be able to cast any kind of magic for the next thirty minutes. I already told you, I specialize in dealing with elementalists. My shield protects me against most magical attacks, my weapon can absorb the elements, and I have a sword technique that can temporarily sever your link with the magical plane. You never stood a chance to begin with."

Kate tries to get up, but she realizes she can't hope to outrun Daren with her wounded leg. Defeated, she does not say another word and she bows her head, looking at the ground as would a convicted murderer while awaiting their execution.

 "Come, now, Kate. Don't be like that. You should know better than anyone that the purification ritual has  almost no chance of failure. Once we deal with the banshee within you, we'll be able to keep travelling together, just like before."

Daren says an incantation and he readies his sword, which starts glowing with a bright white light.

"Daren, NO! You promised!" I shout at him. 

Daren stops his sword upon hearing my words.

"You promised that you wouldn't try to purify her until you saw her turn into a banshee!"

Kate raises her head and looks at me, with a mixture of sadness and regret visible in her eyes.

"I can't believe you, Barry," Daren says to me. "She almost killed you back there, and you're still saying things like this?"

"She wasn't going to kill me. But if I'm right about her not being a banshee, then you were the one that was about to kill her just now. Please, give me a few more minutes with her. I'm sure if we talk things through we can still fix this."

"Have you gone mad?"

"Why's that? You said it yourself. She can't cast magic for the next half of an hour, and she's not running anywhere with that leg wound you gave her. I won't be in any danger."

 Daren lowers his sword and grumbles, but he doesn't find a good reason to not grant me my request.

"Fine, you can have her. But she'd better have a damn good reason for all of this."

He gestures at Kate.

"Well, you heard Barry. Go with him."

Kate gets up and tries to walk all the way to me, but she trips due to her leg injury. I rush over to her in order to grab her before falling, and then we both start to head deeper into the forest. As we walk, Kate is holding my left arm with both her hands, in order to keep herself from falling again. She does not say a word to me while we distance ourselves from Daren, but she is holding my arm very tightly, even though she hasn't tripped once since we started walking. 

Once we've put enough distance between ourselves and Daren, I help Kate lay down with her back against an oak tree, and she simply stares at the ground, still not saying anything.

Kate doesn't say anything and just sits there, continuing to stare at the ground. Before I get the chance to ask her again, she lifts her head and looks me straight in the eye, with a serious but sad look on her face.

"Barry, why did you save me?" she asks.

"What do you mean? Why wouldn't I?"

"Because I almost murdered you in cold blood a few minutes ago."

"Yeah, yeah, sure. You can act all tough now, but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts to follow through, remember?"

"You..." Kate starts to say as she grabs me by the shirt. 

When she sees me smiling, she calms down and lets go of me, subsequently leaning her back against the tree behind her.

 "I understand now..." she says, looking away from me. "I understand that you're the one that's been keeping me safe ever since we met yesterday. It all came to me in that one moment when I tried to kill you. Why did Daren never look at me as if I were human if he was the one that came to the conclusion that I wasn't a banshee? Why did you and Daren have a secret way to communicate in case I turned against you if he trusted me so much? There was only one way it could have all made sense. I just didn't want to believe it."

She turns her gaze back to me.

"Barry, if you hadn't been there to stop Daren from killing me yesterday, I would have paid dearly for my foolishness. And yet, I have repaid your kindness by putting a knife to your throat. Can you ever forgive me?"

"Hey, now, you're making this sound a lot worse than it actually was! All's well when it ends well, right? What's important is that no lasting harm was done, and once Daren heals your leg and your ice powers come back, everything can go back to normal."

I pause.

"So..." I tell Kate as I hold out my hand to her. "Are we still friends, then?"

 "This isn't really what I imagined saving a damsel in distress would be like."

Kate lets out a sniff and smiles sadly, while still looking at the ground.

"You really are one of a kind, aren't you?" she says.

"I don't know what you mean by that, but I'm going to choose to take it as a compliment."

Kate lifts her head and looks me straight in the eye.

"Barry, why did you save me?" she asks.

"What do you mean? Why wouldn't I?"

"Because I almost murdered you in cold blood a few minutes ago."

"Yeah, yeah, sure. You can act all tough now, but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts to follow through, remember?"

 I take off my backpack and reach inside of it with my right hand. It looks completely empty from the outside, but once I focus on the image of the pack of biscuits I'm looking for, I can immediately feel it materialize in the palm of my hand. As I take it out, I grab one of the biscuits and hand it to Kate.

"Here you go," I tell her. "You must be hungry after all that fighting."

She looks at me confused for a second and then decides to accept my offering.

"...Thank you," she says as she takes a bite and starts eating quietly.

"I got these from a shop near my house. They always had the best biscuits. It's too bad I didn't know Daren back then, though. If I had a backpack like this I would have stacked it with hundreds of these delicious--"

"Barry..." Kate interrupts me as she lifts her head and looks me straight in the eye. "Why did you save me?"

She looks at me, trying to figure out if I'm being serious or not.

"Are you completely out of your mind?"

"Of course I am! Surely, you must have realized this when you found out about the true reason I joined the tournament." 

"How could you even still consider travelling with me after what has happened? Don't you understand that you're putting yourself in danger by just being around me?"

"So what? How would travelling with you be any more dangerous than having to fight a stillwater and a dragon in the same day? At least if you're coming with us, I'll feel safer, knowing that you're watching my back."

Kate pauses, and looks at me hesitantly.

 "Are you sure about this?" she asks.

"Yes, yes, I'm sure! Now, come on. Shake my hand, already! My arm is going numb."

Kate smiles faintly, as she grabs my hand and squeezes it firmly.

"You're an idiot," she says. 

"I know," I tell her as we finish our handshake. "Now, come on, we should get going. If we keep standing around here, Daren will surely start to think that you found a way to attack me again or something. I'm sure I can find a way to smooth things over with him somehow."

"No, wait... We can't go on like this. I owe you an explanation for everything that's happened. It's the least I can do."

 "Does this have anything to do with the Beacon of Hope?"

"Yes... This has everything to do with the Beacon of Hope."

She pauses.

"The Beacon was... an orphanage, of sorts. They took in children from all over the continent and offered them shelter and free meals. I was born in Varathia, and abandoned as a child, so I was sent there at a very young age. The institution was run by a handful of very influential lessathi at the time, who had deep ties with the Varathian royalty. Unfortunately, the true purpose of that orphanage was not to shelter children who had no home, but to exploit them because they had no family members left to ask about them. Through repeated experimentation, the lessathi were trying to find a way to turn regular humans into mages."

"So, what you're saying is that you got your powers as a result of these experiments?"

"I did... Although, the methods they used had an extremely low chance of success. Forcefully injecting magical circuits into a human body is not only a very risky procedure, but also... particularly painful. Of the thousands of orphans that were detained in that institution, only a handful of us survived. Due to the lack of results on their part, the lessathi eventually stopped receiving funds for their project from the royalty, and they were forced to shut down the Beacon."

 "So, uh... did they just let you all go after that?"

"No, they didn't. I was part of the rejects. Their prolonged experiments had somehow failed to kill me, but my magic was so weak at the time that I could barely conjure a snowflake. They had no need for rejects, so they just dumped us on other continents. They used their teleportation magic to transport each of us in various remote jungles across the world, with nothing to our names other than the clothes on our backs, and some knives they gave us to fend for ourselves. I was twelve at the time."

Kate's eyes shift to the left as she talks and her gaze becomes more distant. She must be reliving those moments from long ago as she is recounting them to me.

"I spent weeks in that jungle, hunting small animals and avoiding predators in order to survive. When I finally managed to reach civilization, I was greeted with terrified screams, and people running away at the sight of me. It didn't take me long to find out about banshees, and to understand that there was no longer a place for me in society. As time passed, I started encountering banshee hunters and white mages that wanted to have me purified. Luckily, by the time I started meeting them, my magical powers had increased considerably, and I became able to defend myself."

 "Can you first tell me who these lessathi are, exactly? My understanding was that they were some ancient race from this continent that went extinct a long time ago."

"Yes and no. They are indeed the oldest race on this continent, which is why most people refer to them as simply 'the ancients'. However, even though their civilization fell hundreds of years ago, there are still small groups of lessathi here and there, staying hidden and trying to influence events from the shadows. As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods."

"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?"

"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore. They are very secretive, and also very isolated from all other races. They have their own villages, hidden from the rest of the world, and they are only allowed to marry other lessathi. This is why I'm very surprised you are unaware of your own heritage."

"So, if the ancients are hidden from most of the world, how come you know so much about them?"

Kate pauses.

 "Do you remember how Eiden said I was a survivor from the Beacon of Hope?"

"Yeah. You never did tell me what it was."

Due to her talents, she was assigned to the lessathi's elite task force, and often served as a personal bodyguard to the highest ranked members of their group."

"Wait, if they became so strong, how come they didn't fight back?"

"The lessathi had some collars that they used to prevent the mages from using their magic against them. The effects were somewhat similar to those of the spells preventing us from attacking locals in this tournament.

As the earthquake intensifies, we start seeing a human figure in the distance, getting bigger and bigger, until it reaches a height of fifty feet. The giant man is dressed in leather armor, he has a black beard that reaches down to his chest, and he has a big grin on his face. As he starts to speak, his voice is so loud that it completely drowns out any other sounds in a five mile radius. It doesn't really help that he's shouting either.

"Now that I have everyone's attention," the giant man says. "I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Hadrik, but my friends call me 'the dwarf'. I came to this tournament for only one reason: to test my strength against the strongest mages in the world! So, what do you all say?! Shall we have a fun little practice bout before we get our objectives? I'll be waiting right here for any challengers! I'll try to hold back as much as I can, but I can't make any promises. Ahahahahahahahaha!"

His laugh is loud and jolly, kind of like the laughter you hear from friendly bartenders and innkeepers. What's wrong with this guy? Doesn't he realize what kind of place this is?

The giant starts to shrink slowly as he's laughing, and eventually he disappears behind the trees.

 "Damn!" Daren says. "That is some impressive shapeshifting. He must have a lot of magical power to be able to turn into something this big!"

"Do you have no knowledge of even the basics of shapeshifting magic?" Kate asks him. "You can't just turn into something ten times bigger than your normal size, no matter how powerful you are. It violates the fundamental principles of shapeshifting. This was obviously an illusion."

"Oh yeah? Since you're so sure it was an illusion, could you perhaps care to explain how he managed to make such a realistic earth tremor while he was busy maintaining the illusion spell?"

"How am I supposed to know that? Maybe he has an ally that specializes in earth magic. How is that even relevant?"

Something isn't right here. Although the fundamental principles Kate speaks of should indeed prohibit the use of shapeshifting in such a manner, an illusion isn't that much more probable either. There's no way any illusion could reach this far out, no matter how powerful the mage is. There must be something we're missing. Or perhaps the man who calls himself Hadrik managed to find a way to temporarily circumvent the laws of magic as we know them?

 "I think Kate's right," I say. "The laws of magic can't be broken like that, no matter how skilled a mage is."

"You're just saying this to get on her good side," he tells me.

"Well, it doesn't matter either way," Kate says. "This is obviously a trap. I honestly can't imagine how anyone could be stupid enough to fall for something so--"

Suddenly, the bodies of me, Kate and Daren all start to vibrate loudly, as we get enveloped in a white light.

"Oh, no..." Kate says.

"What? What's happening?" Rose asks us.

"Rose, catch!" Daren says, as he throws her his transceiver.

As soon as she catches it, the three of us get teleported away at the same time. The sensation I'm getting is the same as the one I got when I was first transported to this continent. It feels almost as if every fiber in my body is being decomposed and then slowly reassembled, while I maintain full awareness of myself throughout the entire process. When I regain all of my senses, I find myself surrounded by a few dozen mages, with Daren and Kate standing right beside me. The mages are looking all around themselves, confused.

 It seems we weren't the only ones that were teleported here all of a sudden. I recognize one of the mages as being the giant that challenged us. He is surprisingly smaller than I expected him to be. I don't think he's much taller than four feet. That explains why they call him 'the dwarf'. Judging by the position of a very tall tree I had chosen as a landmark when we left, I'd say we've been teleported right in the middle of the clearing where Hadrik first made his appearance a few moments ago. Is this the dwarf's doing?

"Good evening, gentlemen!" we hear a voice coming from above.

We all look up at the same time and see a little brat floating casually in the air with his hands in his pockets and his eyes closed. Eiden. Of course it would be Eiden.

"I am deeply sorry for interrupting you all from your daily activities, but I thought this would be a splendid opportunity for all the participants of the tournament that were in the area to get to know each other better!"

He then raises his eyebrows and starts looking all around him, with his eyes still closed.

"Huh..." he says. "In all honesty, I was expecting this to be a trap of some sort, or at least a well thought-out ambush, but it seems I was mistaken. How disappointing."

"Barry," Daren whispers to me while Eiden is talking. "Take out your transceiver and tell Rose where we are. Tell her to come towards us, and we'll meet her halfway, as soon as we manage to get out of here."

 "Rose can wait until we're safely out of here. I don't want to attract any attention to ourselves."

Daren doesn't really seem to agree with me, but he doesn't want to start an argument either, so he nods slowly.

"And who might you be, young stillwater?" an old mage calls out to Eiden.

Upon taking a closer look at the mage who just spoke, I suddenly realize that I know him all too well. It's impossible to live in the Western Continent and to not have seen his face at least once in your life. His portrait appears almost every month in the newspapers after all. The man standing in front of me is none other than the fabled Azarius, the Sage of the West.

There are many strong mages in the world, but only four of them are officially recognized to be the elite among the elites. They call them the four sages, and each of them represents one of the four major continents in the world. The sage title is earned or maintained through yearly contests that are held by the leading nations of each continent. Given that each of the four major continents is named after the cardinal point that represents its position on the world map, each sage title also carries the appropriate cardinal point in its name.

The Sage of the West looks exactly as I've seen him in the pictures. An old man, almost eighty years of age, with a long beard as white as snow, holding a long wooden staff in his right hand, and wearing traditional wizard robes, as well as a pointed hat. He is like a living example of what most people would imagine when thinking of a mage.

 "Okay, I'm on it," I tell him as I take out my transceiver.

I notice that the volume was set at its maximum level. It's a good thing I saw this before Rose tried to contact us on her own. I set the volume down to its lowest level and put the transceiver close to my ear in order to hear properly, then I tap the device lightly with my other hand.

"Rose, can you hear me?" I whisper through the transceiver.

There's no answer.

"Rose, you need to tap the device once for me to hear what you're saying."

 "Barry? Barry, where are you? What happened?"

"Rose, listen to me closely, I can't talk for long. We were teleported to where the giant appeared a minute ago. Do you remember where that was? Can you make your way to us?"

"Yes, I know where that is. I'll be right there. Be careful!"

 Eiden looks confused, and he quickly turns his head left and right as if making certain that there isn't another stillwater floating beside him.

 "Are you perhaps referring to me?" he says to the sage. "I am quite certain that I'm a fair bit older than you, Sage of the West."

The dwarf named Hadrik suddenly laughs loudly, grabbing everyone's attention. 

"Hahahahahaha! When I called out to everyone earlier, I was hoping for a few strong challengers, but I never dared to dream that a stillwater would actually show up! How about it then? Are you up for a short sparring session to warm ourselves up before the tournament?"

"Actually, I'm not participating in the tournament," Eiden says, smiling. "However, it would be disrespectful of me to decline your challenge, after having teleported all the way here."

He pauses.

 "Very well, then! A sparring session it is. But I wouldn't want to simply crush you with a flick of my fingers. That would be too boring. How about we both agree to use no magic for the duration of our battle?"

"HAH! I like your style, stillwater. We are in agreement, then! No magic until the end of the battle! The fight ends either when one of us can no longer fight, or when one of us gives up!"

The stillwater smiles again, and he starts to slowly descend towards the dwarf. As he lands on the ground, there's a loud murmur coming from the mages all around the clearing, and they all step aside to give the two combatants the space they need to begin their fight. The Sage of the West is watching the two of them intently, with his eyebrows furrowed.

"This is it!" Daren tells me. "This is our chance. Let's get out of here while everyone else is watching the fight."

 As I finish talking with Rose, I notice that there's a loud murmur coming from the people around me, and everyone is moving to clear the center of the clearing, where Eiden and Hadrik are both taking their battle stances, as if they were preparing for a duel.

"What's happening?" I ask Daren.

"They're going to duel without using any magic."

"What?! How did it come to this?"

"The dwarf challenged Eiden to a fight, and the stillwater said it would be rude to decline his challenge after coming all the way here. He also said it would be boring to kill the dwarf with a flick of his fingers, so he suggested the 'no magic' rule."

As Daren talks, my attention is drawn towards an old mage in front of me. He looks oddly familiar. Upon taking a closer look at the old mage, I suddenly realize that I know him all too well.

He is like a living example of what most people would imagine when thinking of a mage. 

"Barry! Hey, Barry!!! Are you listening to me?"

I realize I must have spaced out while looking at the old sage, because I have no idea what Daren's been talking about for the past ten seconds.

"I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said? I don't think I caught all of that."

"I was saying that this is the perfect opportunity to make our way out of here. They won't pay any attention to us because they're too focused on watching the fight."

 "Actually, I think we should watch the fight too."

"Oh, yeah? And why's that? Give me one good reason."

"Gathering intel. Remember how Eiden easily dodged all of your attacks the first time we met him? Since he isn't going to use any magic, this should give us some very valuable information regarding his martial arts training."

"Valuable enough to risk our lives for it?"

"Yes, actually. You do realize we'll likely have to fight him by the end of this tournament, don't you? Shouldn't we take advantage of every chance we get to try and find his weaknesses, even at the risk of our own safety?"

Daren grumbles, the way he always does when he can't find a good enough counter-argument to throw in my face. Eventually, he calms down and steps forward, to get a better look at the battle that is about to begin. 

Kate, who has heard our discussion, is also stepping forward in order to see the fight better. She is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman. 

Just as the two combatants prepare to lunge at each other, there's a very loud voice coming from my left pocket.

"Hello? Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? Hello?" Rose shouts through the transceiver.

 Crap. I had completely forgotten the fact that the device was set at its maximum volume. This is bad. This is really bad. Every single one of the mages is now looking at me, even the two that were about to start fighting.

I quickly tap the transceiver in order to talk to Rose, but before I get to say anything, it is Eiden that answers her question.

"Yes, Rose. We can all hear you," he says, loudly.

"Is that... Is that Eiden?" Rose asks.

"Rose, listen to me," I say as I grab the transceiver from my pocket. "We've all been teleported to where the giant appeared a minute ago. Do you remember where that was? Can you make your way to us?"

"Yes, I remember, but--"

"I'm sorry, but I don't have any more time to talk. I'll fill you in on the details when you get here. Be careful!"

I turn off the transceiver and look all around myself. The mages are still staring at me. This is not going to end well, is it?

"Whoa, whoa, whoa... You've got to be kidding me. Another stillwater?" says one of the mages.

"No, this one's just an ordinary human," Azarius says. "You can tell by the look in his eyes."

 "What are you talking about?" Eiden asks, smiling. "Of course he's a stillwater. Didn't you all see him fight that dragon in the sky singlehandedly a few hours ago?"

There's a loud murmur again, as many of the mages confirm having seen me duel the dragon. If I'm going to want to bluff my way through this tournament, then there will never be a better opportunity than this.

Kate, who has heard our discussion, is also stepping forward in order to see the fight better. She is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman. 

The two combatants are now circling each other. Eiden is smiling as usual, and the dwarf has a big grin on his face. Neither of them are holding any weapons. Are they planning to fight barehanded?

 The fight starts suddenly, without any warning. Both of the fighters lunge at each other at the same time, and Hadrik initiates by jumping into the air, raising his right leg as high as he can and bringing it down like an axe, in an attempt to smash the stillwater's skull. Eiden steps casually to the side and the dwarf's boot hits the ground, which makes a small crater and sends rubble flying all over the place. The stillwater wastes no time and hits Hadrik in the chest with his right palm, his strike sending a powerful blast of air all around him and pushing the dwarf back ten feet.

"What the hell is this?" shouts one of the mages. "They barely even started fighting and they're already using strength enhancing magic?"

"They're not using any magic," says another mage. "I've been closely monitoring their magical auras since they started, and there have been no fluctuations so far."

"What, you're going to tell me they just did a lot of squats and pushups? You can't get this powerful just through training."

 Yes, you can, in theory. There's a kind of magic that helps with surpassing the limitations of the human body while doing physical training. The downside is that unless you have a lifespan of hundreds of years, you'd have to spend most of your life training in order to reach their levels of strength. Could they be using stat devices too?

The two contenders are now moving so fast that I can barely follow them anymore. Eiden is landing most of his hits, but the dwarf doesn't seem to be having any trouble tanking them. Hadrik, however, hasn't managed to hit the stillwater once. Whenever it looks like he's got a decent chance, Eiden flows like water and effortlessly gets out of his way, subsequently using the dwarf's momentum against him in order to make him lose balance.

 "This bastard..." Daren whispers to me. "He was going easy on me the first time we fought. Hell, I'm not even sure if he's being serious right now."

A few more minutes pass, and the fight still doesn't seem to be going anywhere. At least the two combatants seem to be enjoying themselves well enough.

"You're all pathetic!" shouts a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. "There are dozens of you and you're still scared to take on a single stillwater? Don't tell me you're actually planning to watch the fight until the end?"

Eiden and Hadrik have now stopped their battle and are both looking at the mage who just spoke.

"Calm down, my friend," Azarius says. "He already told us that he's not participating in the tournament. Why should we attack him for no good reason?"

"You're a fool to believe him, old man. A fool and a coward. If you're all too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself."

He turns towards Eiden and raises his hands in the air.

"Behold, stillwater. Behold, the power of Felran, the strongest fire elementalist on the Eastern Continent!"

As he speaks, there's an enormous spinning column of fire forming around him. 

 "I see you've already accepted your fate. You're not even trying to raise a magical barrier around yourself. Don't worry, I'll make this quick. I can't really guarantee you it will be painless, though. YAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"

His laugh is just as crazy as the look in his eyes. Eiden looks at him calmly, with his eyes closed, and he raises an eyebrow.

"DIE!" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the stillwater in the form of a beam. Before the flames reach him, Eiden stretches his right arm in front of him, with his palm facing the elementalist mage. All of the fire stops and gets condensed into a small bright sphere, floating in front of his hand. The sphere then gets sent back towards its original owner, with shocking speed, incinerating the elementalist in an instant. The flames disappear just as fast as they appeared, leaving only a pile of ashes where the proud mage once stood. 

"Damn! You sure don't pull your punches," Hadrik tells the stillwater.

"Neither did he, for all the good it did him," Eiden says. 

He then looks towards me, with his eyes still closed and smiles wickedly. Oh no. He must have just realized he also teleported me here along with all the others. What is he plotting this time?

"Alright, let's continue, then!" says the dwarf, grinning.

 "I am terribly sorry, but something came up and I no longer have the time to finish our duel. However, there is another stillwater in this clearing who I'm sure would be more than glad to be your next opponent!"

Before we even take five steps, however, a very loud voice coming from my left pocket drowns out all other noises in the area.

As we make our way out of the crowd, most people are simply ignoring us, while they try to make their way to the center, in order to get a better view of the fight. At this rate, we'll be out of here in no time!

"Hey, watch where you're going you little runt!"

I look behind me, to see what the commotion is about. A very large man that is at least a head taller than Daren is now furiously looking towards Kate, who seems to have bumped into him by accident. She tries to move silently past him, but the man grabs her by the cloak and lifts her into the air.

"Don't you dare ignore me, you son of a--"

As the hood drops from Kate's head and her face is revealed, the large mage paralyzes with fear for a few seconds. He then immediately drops her, backs away three feet and starts screaming at the top of his lungs.

"Aaaaah! Stay away from me, monster! Stay away!"

Everyone's attention has now been directed towards us. Even Eiden and Hadrik have stopped their fight to look in our direction.

 "Not this again," says Daren, exasperated.

"What are you screaming so loud about, you imbecile?" asks a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. "It's just a banshee. There are dozens of us here. She doesn't stand a chance."

"It's not just a banshee," says another mage. "She has allies. I saw her speak to those two over there a few seconds ago."

"What kind of a banshee allies herself with mages, you fools?" Kate shouts at them, with a very determined look on her face. "Don't insult me. I've come here alone. And I'm going to end you all by myself as well."

For a moment, her words confused me, but then I realized she must be trying to protect us. When I try to step towards Kate, Daren stops me.

"Hey, now, let's not get ahead of ourselves," he whispers to me. "Why should we risk our lives just because she refuses to get purified? We can't go on like this forever."

"How can you say something like this? Isn't she our friend?"

"I don't know, is she? When you came back from your little meeting in the woods a few minutes ago you had a bruise on your neck that wasn't there before you left. That was from Kate, wasn't it? You tried to hide it from me for some reason, but you should know as well as I do that she's more trouble than she's worth."

I look behind me, to see what the commotion is about. A very large man that is at least a head taller than Daren is now furiously looking towards Kate, who seems to have bumped into him by accident. She tries to move silently past him, but the man grabs her by the cloak and lifts her into the air.

"Don't you dare ignore me, you son of a--"

As the hood drops from Kate's head and her face is revealed, the large mage paralyzes with fear for a few seconds. He then immediately drops her, backs away three feet and starts screaming at the top of his lungs.

 "Aaaaaaah! Stay away from me, monster! Stay away!"

Everyone's attention has now been directed towards us. Even Eiden and Hadrik have stopped their fight to look in our direction.

"Not this again," says Daren, exasperated.

"What are you screaming so loud about, you imbecile?" asks a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. "It's just a banshee. There are dozens of us here. She doesn't stand a chance."

"It's not just a banshee," says another mage. "She has allies. I saw her speak to those two over there a few seconds ago."

"What kind of a banshee allies herself with mages, you fools?" Kate shouts at them, with a very determined look on her face. "Don't insult me. I've come here alone. And I'm going to end you all by myself as well."

For a moment, her words confused me, but then I realized she must be trying to protect us. When I try to step towards Kate, Daren stops me.

"Hey, now, let's not get ahead of ourselves," he whispers to me. "Why should we risk our lives just because she refuses to get purified? We can't go on like this forever."

 "I'm sorry, Daren, but I can't just abandon her like this. You don't need to do this if you don't want to."

With these words, I leave Daren behind and take Kate's side on the battlefield.

"What are you doing?!" Kate asks me. "What the hell is wrong with you? Don't you understand that this fight can't be won?! I was going to buy you enough time to escape! You weren't supposed to come here!"

"Man, you really know how to ruin the mood. And here I was, thinking that this would turn into a touching and inspirational moment to consolidate our friendship."

"The only thing that's about to get consolidated here is an ice club that I'll use to smack you in your stupid head!"

"Heh. I should be mad, but somehow this scenario seems a lot more fitting for our final moments together."

"How pathetic," says the mage in red robes. "You should have just stayed back and let the banshee fight us. Do you seriously think you can make a difference?"

"I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Do you think a stillwater could make a difference in this fight?"

"No. Not even a stillwater could turn the tide against so many people. But you're not even that, are you? You're just some ordinary guy who's trying to bite off more than he can chew."

 "I guess intimidation tactics don't really work on you, do they?" I ask him as I take out my dagger. "Fine, let's do this. Give it your best shot!"

While the two of us were talking, the other mages were busy moving to surround us. Eiden seems to have teleported away, probably out of boredom, and the dwarf is now also running towards us. The Sage of the West seems to be on the fence about this whole thing, and is watching everything from afar, while gently stroking his white beard.

The mage with the red robes decides to initiate, by shooting a fireball at Kate. She quickly conjures a wall of ice in front of her, which melts on impact with the fireball, but it protects us from the blast of the explosion. The mage in red robes prepares to attack her again, but before he can act, Hadrik places himself between Kate and her attacker and starts panting heavily.

"Hold on... Just... give me a sec..." he says, while everyone looks at him, confused. "Man... I just can't get used to running with these short legs..."

"I have no quarrel with you, dwarf," says the mage with the crazy eyes and red robes. "Step aside, and let us deal with that monster behind you."

"No can do, I'm afraid," the dwarf says. "I can't just stand idly by and let you hoodlums treat a lady with disrespect!"

 "A what?..." the fire elementalist asks, shocked. "Please, tell me that you're not as dumb as you look. Do you feel that magical aura coming from her? Even someone such as you should be able to understand what that means, and what needs to be done. That woman behind you is a banshee. An abomination born from the deepest pits of hell that needs to be eradicated."

"Oh?" Hadrik says, with a smug grin on his face. "Is she, now?"

"Uh-huh," Daren tells me. "Whatever you say, Barry."

While the two of us were talking, Kate was getting surrounded by a few dozen mages. Eiden seems to have teleported away, probably out of boredom, and the dwarf is now also running towards Kate.

 The fire elementalist frowns at the dwarf.

"I see there's no use talking to you," he says. "Very well, then."

The mage lifts his hands in the air, and an enormous spinning column of fire starts forming around him. All of the other mages are getting out of his way, in order to avoid getting burnt to a crisp.  

"Dwarf, you are going to regret picking a fight with me! Behold! Behold, the power of Felran, the strongest fire elementalist on the Eastern Continent!"

As he speaks, the column of fire gets even bigger. 

"I see you've already accepted your fate. You're not even trying to raise a magical barrier around yourself. Don't worry, I'll make this quick. I can't really guarantee you it will be painless, though. YAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"

His laugh is just as crazy as the look in his eyes. Hadrik does not say anything, but I can see him clenching his right fist really hard, and I can feel the magical aura around it harden considerably.

"DIE!" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the dwarf in the form of a beam. Hadrik waits for the fire to reach him, and just before it hits him, he punches it with all of his might. Instead of dispersing, however, all of the fire gets sent back to its owner, at double the speed. Before he can even understand what's going on, Felran gets completely incinerated, leaving behind only a pile of ashes, that are now scattering in the wind.

 "That filthy son of a walrus!" Hadrik says. "He was seriously trying to kill me!"

Seeing the threat that the dwarf poses, all of the other mages that were preparing to attack Kate are now trying to coordinate themselves in order to attack him at the same time. 

"Enough!" shouts Azarius, the sage. "There will be no more bloodshed this day. If any of you toddlers still feel like raising a ruckus, I am the one that you'll be fighting next. Do I make myself clear?"

Some of the mages looked like they were actually considering the old mage's proposition for a few seconds, but in the end they all decided against it, and started sheathing their weapons. The sage starts heading towards us, and as he walks, all of the other mages rush out of his way to give him clear passage.

"Greetings, friends!" he says, smiling, while he looks at the four of us, in turn. "I apologize for not stopping this ridiculous fight sooner. I'm afraid that curiosity got the better of me, and I was hoping that letting things run their course would provide me with the rare opportunity of seeing the great hero Daren in action. When it became clear that this wasn't going to happen, I just had to put a stop to this tomfoolery!"

"I'm not a stillwater, honest!" I tell them. "I was just using an artifact to augment my powers when I fought that dragon."

 "You're all pathetic!" says a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. "There are dozens of you, and you're still hesitating? If you lot are too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself."

The mage in red robes steps out of the crowd and takes his battle stance.

"I hope you will live up to my expectations, stillwater. I intend to take your head as a trophy!"

"Not if I have something to say about it," Daren says, as he steps in front of me, with his sword pointing towards the mage who was just talking.

"The healer in armor stands against me?" asks the fire elementalist. "This is getting better and better! At this rate, I'm going to win this tournament well before they announce the first objectives."

He raises his hands in the air, and an enormous spinning column of fire starts forming around him.

"DIE!" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards us in the form of a beam. Just as the flames reach us, with one quick slash of his sword Daren sends all of the flames back to their owner, incinerating him on the spot and turning him into ashes.

"Did you see that?!" shouts one of the mages. "His sword absorbed the flames and sent them right back at the other mage. They're too strong! We can't hope to beat them!"

"It doesn't matter how strong they are," says a mage in white robes and with long blond hair who appears to be some sort of a healer. "We came to this tournament to win. We knew what we were getting into. And besides, the stillwater hasn't cast any sort of spell since we laid eyes on him. Do you think that's a coincidence?

A dozen or so armed men step in front of him and start brandishing their weapons. The mages who are not allied with the healer seem to be content with just spectating for now.

"They're all weapon enchanters," Daren whispers to me. "But they seem much weaker than Cutthroat Dave, so I should be able to take them all on myself without much trouble. The main problem is going to be that healer. I am willing to bet that he uses healing spells that work during combat, unlike me, so unless I kill each of the men in one strike, they aren't very likely to go down while the white mage is still standing."

Daren is right. Simply aiming to disable these men temporarily is not going to work in this situation. It's either kill or be killed, and I can't afford to let Daren handle them all by himself. I am the one being targeted after all. I need to help him in any way I can.

 I put my hands in my pockets and start walking slowly towards the white mage, trying to mimic Eiden's casual demeanor and laidback smile. As I approach him, the mages that appeared to be part of his group are starting to panic, and they're stepping aside in order to clear my path. When I stop right in front of the healer, looking at him with a smile on my face, I can see his sweat dropping from his forehead. Just as I thought. With the exception of Daren, healers are all bark and no bite.

"What's wrong?" I ask him. "Didn't you say that this was the best time to strike? Well, I'm right here. Give it your best shot!"

The blond mage attempts to grab his dagger, but his hand is trembling too much to be able to unsheathe it. I can see the fear in his eyes as he desperately looks around him for some support from his allies, but they're all too scared to say anything.

"Y-Y-You're in luck, stillwater!" he says, finally. "I've changed my mind. I would much rather fight you on equal terms, after you've fully recovered. I never really liked unfair fights. We'll see you again, soon. Come on, men, we're leaving."

The white mage heads for the forest, and about ten or so mages are slowly starting to follow in his footsteps. After the whole scene has ended, I can see Eiden smirk from afar, while he takes his leave as well, by teleporting out of the clearing.

 Just as I was beginning to think that the danger was gone, I suddenly find myself surrounded by ten rock golems, each of them being at least twice my size.  So there was also a powerful summoner amongst these mages. I was careless to let my guard down just because I scared off a few weaklings.

"What's the matter, stillwater?" I hear a voice coming from behind the wall of golems. "Why don't you try and walk up to my golems like you did with that cowardly healer? Maybe you'll scare them off!"

"Barry!" screams Daren as he slashes through one of the golems and joins my side.

There's still nine golems to go, and they have us surrounded. Daren won't be able to destroy them all by himself while also defending me. I need to do something.

I don't let him finish his sentence and rush towards the white mage with all of my speed, while he's still undefended.

The mages never had a chance to react. I was much too fast for them. Before they even get the chance to blink, I arrive behind the healer and stab him straight through his heart, killing him instantly. As he drops to the ground, his henchmen get paralyzed with fear for a few seconds. It doesn't take them long, however, to snap out of it and unanimously decide to flee the battlefield as fast as they can.

As the cowards run away with their tails between their legs, Daren walks slowly towards me, while shaking his head in disapproval.

 "Really, Barry, couldn't you at least announce me before you do something this risky? What if the enemies decided to surround you after your little stunt instead of running for the hills?"

Unfortunately, I was too slow, and one of the healer's henchmen managed to place himself in front of me before I reached my target.  

I suddenly get a vision of an enemy stabbing me through the chest from behind. I quickly step to the side and manage to avoid the incoming attack right in the nick of time. I then distance myself from the healer's henchmen as much as I can and pull out my crossbow from my backpack. Daren takes full advantage of the diversion I've created and rushes straight into the cluster of troops standing on the left side of the battlefield, directing everyone's attention towards himself. 

There's nine of them on his side and three on mine, not counting the healer. I can do this.

 I shoot the first one in the head while he's being distracted by Daren's bull rush. The second one barely had the time to understand what was going on before I also shot him down. The third one sees what happened to his comrades and attempts to rush at me with his dagger, but it was a futile attempt. Once I kill the last of the henchmen on the right side, I look towards the healer and notice that he is no longer protected by any of his bodyguards. What's more, he isn't even looking towards me, being more concerned with what's happening on Daren's side of the battlefield. It was the easiest thing in the world to take him out as well, with a well placed shot to the temple.

When they see their leader fall to the ground, the mages from his team who were still left alive completely freak out and start running away as far as their legs can carry them, without so much as a single glance back towards us.

It's all or nothing. I take out my dagger and lunge at one of the golems in front of me.

My dagger barely even scratches the surface of the golem's rock hide. There was definitely not enough power behind my blow. The creature seizes the opportunity and brings one of its huge fists down upon me. 

Luckily for me, I am fast enough to get out of its way and manage to escape unharmed. Daren is mowing down the golems a lot faster than I would have expected. He already downed three of them, and he's moving on to the fourth. There's now enough room for me to maneuver around, and these golems are pretty slow, so they shouldn't be a danger to me anymore.

There's several loud and painful bird screams coming from above us and almost immediately afterwards, we see five large hawks falling on the ground at the same time, each of them having been impaled with at least one icicle through their chests. 

 Kate is standing behind us, with her hood off her head, and her signature cold look in her eyes.

"Typical summoner tactics," she says. "Distract the enemies with cannon fodder and then use a surprise attack from above. I am surprised that you actually managed to survive this long without knowing this, Daren. You must have been living quite a sheltered life while you were out on your heroic campaigns."

"Shut up!" Daren says as he cuts through another rock golem. "I was going to deal with those birds once they came down. Not everyone has fancy unlimited ranged attacks to use at their leisure."

My dagger barely even scratches the surface of the golem's rock hide. There was definitely not enough power behind my blow. The creature seizes the opportunity and brings one of its huge fists down upon me. 

There was no time for me to react. There was barely even enough time for me to feel the immense power behind the creature's strike, as it smashed me against the ground, and then casually moved away from me as if nothing had happened.

It's all or nothing. I take out my dagger and lunge at one of the golems in front of me.

My strike was definitely powerful enough to cut through the golem's rock hide, but my dagger was not. My weapon shatters before my eyes, and the creature seizes the opportunity to bring one of its huge fists down upon me.

Being confident in both my strength and toughness abilities, I raise both my arms and stop the hit with my bare hands. The force of the blow buried me two feet in the ground, but I quickly jumped away and went on the offensive. If my weapons are not strong enough to pierce through its rocky surface, then I will just have to use my fists. 

I punch a big hole through the golem's chest, which makes it wobble aimlessly for a few seconds, before finally falling to the ground, lifeless. Hah! I got one. Time to see how Daren is holding up.

I am pleasantly surprised to see that while I was busy fighting that one golem, Daren managed to take down three by himself, and is now going for his fourth. There's now enough room for me to maneuver around, and these golems are pretty slow, so they shouldn't be a danger to me anymore.

 There's several loud and painful bird screams coming from above us and almost immediately afterwards, we see five large hawks falling on the ground at the same time, each of them having been impaled with at least one icicle through their chests. 

Kate is standing behind us, with her hood off her head, and her signature cold look in her eyes.

"Typical summoner tactics," she says. "Distract the enemies with cannon fodder and then use a surprise attack from above. I am surprised that you actually managed to survive this long without knowing this, Daren. You must have been living quite a sheltered life while you were out on your heroic campaigns."

"Shut up!" Daren says as he cuts through another rock golem. "I was going to deal with those birds once they came down. Not everyone has fancy unlimited ranged attacks to use at their leisure."

If I try to block this outright, the force of the impact will break my bones, regardless of my strength. However, I know of a combat technique that will allow me to use the golem's own strength against it. 

As the creature's fist approaches me, I sidestep out of its way, I grab the golem by the arm, and then I throw it right into another one of the golems, smashing them both to bits. Hah! I got two of them. Time to see how Daren is holding up.

I'm not going to win an arm wrestling match against one of these monsters anytime soon. There's no use trying to fight them head on. I'll just let Daren do his thing and try to avoid getting hit as long as possible.

Fortunately, my speed is more than enough to effectively dodge the rock golems' strikes. They have very slow movements, and it's easy to predict how they will attack next. 

After dodging a few golems, I take a look towards Daren to see how he's doing, and I am pleasantly surprised to find out that he's already dispatched four of them, and is moving on to his fifth. There's now enough room for me to maneuver around, and these golems are pretty slow, so they shouldn't be a danger to me anymore.

Even taking into account the golems' very slow movements, the sheer number of them makes it quite difficult to dodge them all just by using my speed. Luckily, I've spent a few points in my observation skill, which makes it possible for me to pay attention to several golems at the same time, even in these conditions.

As I start moving around to dodge the golems, I realize that this isn't nearly as easy as I may have expected. They might be extremely slow, but the sheer number of them  makes it almost impossible to avoid their attacks by just using my speed. I need to get out of here fast, or I'll get pummeled to death. 

I suddenly see an opening in their formation, probably made when Daren killed one of them. I rush towards it with all the speed I can muster, but one of the golems sees me and intercepts me before I escape. One punch is all it took to completely smash my skull, as my body fell to the ground, lifeless.

 One of the mages starts to scream very loudly, while pointing at Kate.

"Aaaaaaah! A banshee! It's a banshee! Quick, kill her before she fully awakens!"

A lot of the mages who seemed to be on the fence about this whole fight until now are slowly starting to join the battle as well, in order to kill Kate. Eiden seems to have teleported away while we were fighting the golems, and Hadrik, who now lost his dueling partner, is also running towards us, probably looking to join in on the fun.

The summoner mage is beyond himself with joy thanks to this latest turn of events. Now that I get a clear look at him, I see that he is about six feet tall,  and that he has long, pointy ears, green eyes and blond hair. I've travelled a lot in my life, but this is the first time I've actually seen an elf in the flesh. Usually, they are very isolated from the rest of the world and rarely go outside the Elven Nation from the Eastern Continent. I heard that they've been invited here too, but I wasn't actually expecting any of them to show up. I guess this goes to show just how much of an importance the Magium holds for mages all around the world. 

"Hah!" he says, triumphantly. "This is what you all get for siding with a banshee, you lowly peasants. It's time for me to prove to you why us elves are superior to you in every way. And I'm going to start by dealing with that monstrosity that killed my poor little hawks."

 The summoner prepares to call more creatures into battle, but before he can act, Hadrik places himself between Kate and her attacker and starts panting heavily.

"Hold on... Just... give me a sec..." he says, while everyone looks at him, confused. "Man... I just can't get used to running with these short legs..."

"Is this supposed to be some sort of a joke?" asks the elf. "You dwarves have always had a sense of humor beyond my understanding. Step aside, if you know what's best for you."
  
"No can do, I'm afraid," Hadrik says. "I can't just stand idly by and let you hoodlums treat a lady with disrespect!"

"A lady?! I must admit, I've heard the rumors about dwarves drinking so much that they have ale running through their veins instead of blood, but I never thought them to be true."

"Aye! And I never expected that old saying about elves never leaving home without a stick up their arse to turn out to be true, either. It's a crazy world we're living in, I'll tell you that!"

 The summoner scowls upon hearing the dwarf's words.

"That 'lady' you are so keen to protect is a banshee. She is a plague upon this land which must be dealt with immediately."

"Oh?" Hadrik says, with a smug grin on his face. "Is she, now?"

"If you're not going to get out of my way, then you can join these fools in their deaths. I've heard enough of your idiocy for one day."

Just as the summoner and all of the other mages are preparing to attack, a loud shout from Azarius the sage freezes everyone in place.

"Enough!" he shouts. "There will be no more bloodshed this day. If any of you toddlers still feel like raising a ruckus, I am the one that you'll be fighting next. Do I make myself clear?"

 "What?!" asks the elf. "Have you gone mad?! Do you realize what will happen if we let this evil monster roam free?"

"I am well aware of the consequences, and I am willing to take full responsibility for my actions. You are, however, free to challenge me to a duel if you believe your cause to be the righteous one."

The summoner looks as if he were about to explode, but he ultimately decides to simply turn around and leave, without saying another word. The other mages who were about to join the fight are now all sheathing their weapons.

"I am deeply sorry for not stopping this ridiculous fight sooner, my friends," Azarius says, looking at all four of us, in turn. "I'm afraid that curiosity got the better of me and I couldn't bring myself to end this before getting the rare opportunity to see the great hero Daren in action!"

Before they get to finish their conversation, a mage dressed in black robes and with a snake tattoo on his bald head interrupts them by making a loud tsk-tsk sound.

"This will not do, Sage of the West," he says. "This simply will not do."

Azarius turns to him, smiling calmly.

"A follower of the God of Death honors us with his presence?" he says. "If I did anything to offend you, then by all means, please state your complaint!"

 "My complaint is simple, sage. My god requires more sacrifices to be had this day, and you deprived him of them by interrupting this fight."

 The necromancer pulls himself out of his ally's grasp and starts casting a spell.

"Tell me, Azarius," he says. "Have you ever heard of the still winter?"

"I've heard several accounts of it when I visited this continent in the past, yes," the sage answers calmly. "But none of them were what I would call reliable. Supposedly, it was a great war that was waged on this continent between stillwaters and ancients some six hundred years ago."

"Indeed," Zack says. "But what would you do if I told you that the remains of the stillwaters who died in that war can still be found deep underground, scattered throughout the continent."

As the necromancer speaks, dozens of skeletons are starting to slowly surface from the ground below us. 

"What would you do if I told you that I could bring these stillwaters back to life as my puppets, with almost all of their former magical prowess still intact?"

 The skeletons are now starting to attack all of the mages around us while they're running away, screaming in terror. The sky itself has darkened as it started literally raining fire and brimstone. Kate is struggling to keep an icy roof above our heads to shield us from the flames, but it's melting almost as quick as she's reinforcing it.

"What would you do, sage? Tell me!"

"Well, since you asked me so politely," Azarius says, smiling. "What I would do is this."

The Sage of the West smashes his staff into the ground, and I can feel a very intense vibration in the air all around us. The skeletons have suddenly stopped rampaging and are all just standing in place, vibrating loudly. After a few seconds, all of their bones shatter into pieces at the same time, as the rain of fire is brought to a halt, and the sky is starting to clear up once more.

Zack, the necromancer appears to be dumbstruck, as he desperately looks around himself to see if there isn't at least one of his undead minions that escaped the onslaught.

 "That was an impressive spell, no doubt," Azarius says. "But in the end, despite their ridiculous amount of magical power, those skeletons were only a bunch of old dried up bones bound together with magic. A powerful enough sonic attack can shatter any object as long as you correctly match its vibration frequency. Now, if I'm not mistaken, that spell of yours has a duration of about five minutes and can only be cast once per day. Unless you have some other trick up your sleeve, I believe there are a few persons who would like to have a word with you and your companion..."

All of the mages that were being chased by skeletons a few moments ago have now surrounded the necromancer and his ally, and you can see that they are thirsting for blood.

"I'm tired of your crap, Zack," says the necromancer's companion. "Every single time it's like this. I'm tired of always having to save your sorry behind. Next time we're in a town, you're the one buying the drinks."

The mage with the circlet on his head then throws something on the ground, which explodes and fills the whole area with a thick gray smoke. 

"Quick!" says one of the mages. "Disperse the smoke! Don't let them get away."

 An air elementalist blows all of the smoke away, and we can see Zack and his friend a few hundred feet from us, running towards the trees.

"After them!" says a mage, and they all start chasing the two of them. 

Eventually, the mages disappear into the forest, the only persons still remaining in the clearing being me, Daren, Kate, Hadrik, Azarius, and a young boy, likely in his late teens who seems to be the sage's loyal retainer.

"It really never ceases to amaze me how easily people can be fooled by simple illusions like that!" Azarius says, while stroking his beard.

 "Illusion? Don't you mean smoke bomb?"

"No, no, I was talking about what happened after the smoke. The two mages you saw run towards the forest were in fact decoys. The real mages waited invisibly for everyone to leave and then they teleported away. I figured they learned their lesson, so I let them off with a stern warning for now."

"Barry! Kate! Daren!" we hear Rose shout from the other end of the clearing. "Thank the gods you are okay..."

As she approaches us, she pauses to catch her breath. She must have been running all the way here.

"What happened?" she asks us. "How did you all end up in this place?"

"It was Eiden," Daren says. "He teleported us here along with another fifty mages, probably in the hope that he'd get to watch us all kill each other, but he eventually got bored and teleported away. Most of the other mages left the clearing in a hurry a few seconds ago, chasing after some necromancer who tried to kill us all but failed miserably."

 "I see..." Rose says.

She turns towards Hadrik and walks over to him, offering to shake his hand.

"You must be the shapeshifting giant from before! I'm very pleased to meet you! My name is Rose. Did you manage to find the challenger you were looking for?"

"Aye, lass," Hadrik says, grinning,  as he grabs her hand and shakes it. "I believe I have!" 

Did he just take a quick glance towards me when he said that? Oh gods, I hope not. Maybe it was just my imagination.

"That is good to hear!" Rose says, smiling. 

She then turns towards Azarius.

"I'm sorry, do I know you from somewhere?" she asks him. "You look very familiar."

"I do not believe we've met before, but my portrait appears in the newspapers every once in a while, so you may know me from there. My name is Azarius. Pleased to make your acquaintance!"

 "Wait, are you saying that those mages are still hiding around here, invisibly?"

"No, no, no, of course not! What would they have had to gain from still lingering around here after what just happened? They did go invisible while everything was covered in smoke, but as soon as all of the mages were lured away by their decoys, they simply teleported away. I figured they learned their lesson, so I let them off with a stern warning for now."

 "Master Azarius," says the young boy standing beside him. "I do not mean to be rude, but may I ask why you chose to intervene in this fight? Weren't you the one who taught me that banshees are foul demons that are not to be trusted?"

"Henry, I've told you many times before, there is no need to be so formal when you address me. You can call me simply Azarius. As for your question, before I answer you, I must ask you this: Do you remember the first lesson I taught you about banshees? Do you remember why banshees need to possess human or animal bodies in order to survive?"

"Of course! The banshees were originally born on the magical plane of existence, but they were banished long ago and cursed to live the rest of their lives on our earthen plane. On this plane, it is not possible to live for long without a physical body, so the banshees were forced to adapt, by stealing the bodies of other living organisms. Once it is seized by a banshee, the body stops aging, but due to the incompatibility between the banshee's soul and the physical body, the link between the two will decay over time, which forces the spirit to change hosts once every few decades."

"Very good!" Azarius says. "Now, tell me, do you sense any kind of other-worldly vibe radiating from this woman's body? Does her magical aura appear in any way to be different from that of any other mage you've encountered in your life?"

"No, but, I do not understand... How can this be?..."

 The sage smiles.

"That is because she isn't a banshee. She is a woman with magical powers. A woman mage, if you will."

"What?!" Daren blurts out. "How can you be so sure? You can't possibly tell me that you are basing your entire reasoning on something so vague!"

"You surprise me, healer in armor," Azarius says, thoughtfully, as he strokes his beard. "The way you phrased your last sentence suggests that you do not believe this woman to be anything other than a banshee. And yet you seem to travel alongside her. Most peculiar."

Daren is looking a little flustered after hearing the sage's remark, but Azarius pays him no mind and instead steps towards me.

"What about you, Barry?" he asks me. "From what I could gather, the four of you are all travelling together. How would you define your relationship with the young woman named Kate?"

"Oh? But you appear to be more comfortable around her than your companion. Tell me, Barry, do you consider her to be a banshee as well?"

"What? No! Of course not!"

"Interesting... May I ask you then if you know about the Beacon of Hope?"

"Yes, she..."

I take a short glance towards Kate before I continue.

"She told me everything..."

"Wait a minute," Daren interrupts us. "Didn't Eiden say something about the Beacon this morning?"

"Yeah, he said that Kate was a survivor from there," I tell him.

"A survivor?" Daren asks. "Yeah, now I remember. And he didn't want to tell us what that meant. What is this Beacon of Hope, anyway?"

"To put it bluntly," Azarius says, "the Beacon of Hope was a human experimentation facility disguised as an orphanage. The purpose of that institution was to create mages artificially. Kate's magical powers are a direct result of those experiments."

 "She's... what?..." Daren asks, seemingly in too much of a shock to be able to form a coherent sentence.

"Kate, you were a mage?" Rose asks, surprised.

"Yes..." Kate answers her. "What did you think I was?"

"Well, those mages we met in the forest this morning kept shouting that you were a banshee, so I kind of figured that's what you were... Everyone seemed to know what it meant, so I didn't want to appear dumb by asking."

Kate laughs softly.

"I guess labels aren't really very important to you, are they, Rose?" she says, smiling.

"Still, I have to admit," Hadrik says, grinning, "I didn't expect to meet two survivors from the Beacon in the same day. This tournament is really something else!"

"Two survivors?" I ask him. "You mean to say that there is another artificial mage here on this continent besides Kate?"

"Aye!" the dwarf says. "And she's mighty strong too! She took me out with almost no effort. I'm pretty sure that she was using lightning in the same way elementalists would use water or fire. Being an artificial mage sure has its perks!"

"She and her friends in dark blue robes have a camp set up not far from here," Hadrik says. "From what I understood, they had no plans to leave until later tomorrow."

"Could you take me to them?!" Kate blurts out, perhaps a little too loudly.

The dwarf looks slightly taken aback by Kate's sudden request.

"Please..." she adds, this time in a lower, pleading voice.

"Hmm..." Hadrik says. "You're asking quite a lot of me, lass. I only barely escaped with my life the last time. Is this woman your friend?"

"Yes..." Kate says. "She is a very old friend..."

Hadrik gives Kate a long pondering look before he decides to speak.

"Tell you what," the dwarf says. "I'll agree to lead you to your friend's camp on one condition!"

"Name it!" Kate says, her face suddenly lighting up.

 Hadrik grins.

"Your friend over there has to beat me in a duel!" he says, as he turns towards me.

"Barry?!" Kate shouts, with a mixture of both shock and disappointment in her voice. "You want Barry to defeat you in a duel? You can't be serious! Why him of all people?"

"Well, I don't know if he's a stillwater or not, but I am quite positive I saw him singlehandedly fighting a dragon in the sky a few hours ago. You rarely get to meet a worthier opponent!"

Kate looks at me hesitatingly, probably wanting to see what my reaction is to all of this.

"I'm not looking for an all out fight," Hadrik says. "We wouldn't want to wear ourselves out completely before the tournament even begins. A short sparring session will do! No magic, no weapons, just like my fight with the stillwater from before. And since we're in a hurry, whoever makes the other one fall to the ground first will be declared the victor!"

The dwarf turns to me, grinning yet again.

"So, what do you say, Barry? Are you in or are you out?"

"Hah! That's the spirit!" Hadrik says.

"Barry, wait!" Kate says. "You'll get yourself killed!"

"I'll be fine!" I tell her as I move to align myself with the dwarf, leaving about twenty feet of distance between us.

Kate doesn't try to stop me anymore, but I can see that she has an uneasy look in her eyes. The others are now stepping aside in order to give us the space we need to begin our fight. 

There's something that's been bothering me ever since we got teleported here. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this, but the dwarf has been shapeshifting this entire time. I can tell by the feel of his magical aura. This is not his original form. As far as I know, shapeshifting magic can only be used to change your size, or to transform yourself into another creature. It cannot be used to disguise yourself as someone else. What possible benefit could Hadrik get from transforming himself into a dwarf?

I then suddenly remember his first appearance. Of course! Now it all makes sense! Why didn't I realize this sooner? Shapeshifting magic cannot be used to turn yourself into a giant, but it can be used to turn yourself into a dwarf. He didn't use magic to become fifty foot tall, he just reverted to his original form. Hadrik is a giant! The reason he is masquerading as a dwarf is likely because giants were never invited to this tournament, and he fears that they will kick him out if they find out the truth.  

 This must mean that he has inhuman strength! When shapeshifting into something smaller than yourself, you usually retain a small part of your original mass and most of your original strength. A single punch from him could blow me to bits. I need to be extra careful here. Even if he said this was going to be a sparring match, he doesn't really look like the kind of guy who knows how to hold back.

Now that I know that he is a giant, I can use this information to my advantage! Since he chose to transform into a dwarf and not a human, his body proportions are completely different from those of his normal body. He even said himself that he wasn't used to running with short legs. I'm willing to bet that this is affecting his sense of balance somehow. I just need to use techniques that aim specifically to knock him off balance.

Hadrik is now grinning and cracking his knuckles.

"Well, Barry," he says after a while. "Here I come!"

The dwarf comes charging directly towards me, without bothering to use any evasive maneuvers. Just before he reaches me, he picks up speed and appears right in front of me, almost as if he'd used teleportation. 

Instead of going for a punch, however, he attempts to prod me with his index finger.

"Dwarf," Kate says. "How about another deal? I will fight you instead of Barry, and if I win, you will lead me to my friend's camp. But instead of a fistfight, we'll have a magic duel."

"A magic duel?" Hadrik says, with a grin. "Are you sure about that?"

"I'm positive."

"Well, then, we have a deal! You defeat me in a magic duel, and I will personally lead you to where you want to go! I'm just going to need a few seconds to get ready, if you don't mind."

As Kate was talking, the dwarf started rapidly gaining in size. The ground began to shake violently as he grew more and more, while his skin started getting covered in black scales and wings started sprouting out of his back. When he reached the end of his transformation, Hadrik had turned into a full blown black dragon, almost the same size as Tyrath.

"There," Hadrik says, baring his fangs to show his usual wide grin. "Now I'm ready!"

 "Gods have mercy..." Kate says, looking up at the huge monster that had spawned before her.

"Aaaaaaaah!" Rose starts screaming all of a sudden as she sees the dragon. "Stay away! Stay away!"

"Rose, calm down," Daren tells her. "It's just Hadrik in his shapeshifted form. It's not a real dragon."

Kate frowns.

"No," Kate says. "I was just a little surprised, that's all. But if it's a dragon fight you want, then I have no objections."

Kate is now assembling her very own dragon out of sculpted ice, with a size to match that of Hadrik's. But this seems different from all of her other spells. The ice dragon that is now standing before us seems almost as if it were an actual living, breathing creature. This is on a whole other level compared to what she's cast before. She must really be going all out.

"You may have the appearance of a dragon," Kate says. "But you and I both know that shapeshifting does not grant you the ability to breathe fire, and you can't cast any fire spells while you are in that form either. Let's see how long you can last against my ice."

Kate is now assembling her very own dragon out of sculpted ice, with a size to match that of Hadrik's. But this seems different from all of her other spells. The ice dragon that is now standing before us seems almost as if it were an actual living, breathing creature. This is on a whole other level compared to what she's cast before. She must really be going all out.

"You may have the appearance of a dragon," Kate says. "But you and I both know that shapeshifting does not grant you the ability to breathe fire, and you can't cast any fire spells while you are in that form either. Let's see how long you can last against my ice."

 "I was just caught off guard by your speed. Normally, I'm not so weak."

"Oh?" the dwarf says, grinning. "How about a rematch, then? Although, I have to warn you that this time I won't be going easy on you anymore."

"No!" Kate shouts, as she comes towards us and then turns to me. "Barry, I'm really sorry that you got hurt for my sake. I shouldn't have let you fight in my stead."

Now she turns to Hadrik.

"Dwarf," Kate says. "How about another deal? I will fight you instead of Barry, and if I win, you will lead me to my friend's camp. But instead of a fistfight, we'll have a magic duel."

"A magic duel?" Hadrik says, with a grin. "Are you sure about that?"

"I'm positive."

"Well, then, we have a deal! You defeat me in a magic duel, and I will personally lead you to where you want to go! I'm just going to need a few seconds to get ready, if you don't mind."

"Of course," Kate says. "Feel free to cast any protection spells you want. I've already cast mine this mor--"

As Kate was talking, the dwarf started rapidly gaining in size. The ground began to shake violently as he grew more and more, while his skin started getting covered in black scales and wings started sprouting out of his back. When he reached the end of his transformation, Hadrik had turned into a full blown black dragon, almost the same size as Tyrath.

 "There," Hadrik says, baring his fangs to show his usual wide grin. "Now I'm ready!"

"Gods have mercy..." Kate says, looking up at the huge monster that had spawned before her.

"Aaaaaaaah!" Rose starts screaming all of a sudden as she sees the dragon. "Stay away! Stay away!"

"Rose, calm down," Daren tells her. "It's just Hadrik in his shapeshifted form. It's not a real dragon."

"What's wrong, Kate?" Hadrik says. His voice is much deeper and louder than when he's in his dwarf form. "You aren't going to back out on me now, are you?"

Kate frowns.

"No," Kate says. "I was just a little surprised, that's all. But if it's a dragon fight you want, then I have no objections."

ID: Ch7-Kate-vs-Hadrik
TEXT:

 Hadrik grins, and he soars into the sky. Kate's dragon follows him, and in the meantime, she starts building a cage of ice around herself, which she then uses to raise herself into the air, in order to get a better view of the fight.

The two dragons are diving at each other and attacking with both their claws and their fangs. Kate's reinforced ice seems to be holding up rather well against Hadrik's attacks. I'm quite sure that Tyrath would have sliced through her ice dragon as through butter. I guess his 'king of all dragons' title was not just for show after all.

Kate is now ramping up her attacks by also shooting Hadrik with hundreds of icicles while her ice dragon is still on his tail. Every time that Hadrik tries to go for Kate, she moves her cage out of his way, and sends her ice dragon to intercept him. Some of the icicles hit the black dragon in his left wing, and he starts falling from the sky, as the ice dragon takes full advantage of this opportunity and dives right onto its opponent.

The two dragons crash on the ground, with the ice one on top, pinning the black one into place with its claws. Kate is now slowly descending as well, still in her ice cage, and she looks at Hadrik, waiting for his next move.

"Okay, okay, I give up, you win!" Hadrik says, as he transforms back into his dwarf form.

Upon hearing his words, Kate brings her cage back down, and once she's safely on the ground, she dismisses both the cage and the dragon.

 "Does this mean that you'll grant me my request?" Kate says, with a hopeful look in her eyes.

"Well, I can't say that I'm really looking forward to it, but a deal's a deal. Pack your bags, Kate, I'm going to lead you to your friend!"

"Thank you so much..." Kate says. "I have a lot of money with me, I promise I will make it worth your while."

 "We don't know very much about him, really, since we only just met him this morning," I tell him. "From what I could tell, he has a ridiculous amount of magical power and can use multiple types of elemental magic. He also seems to be able to completely ignore the traditional laws of magic. When we first met him, he just bypassed all of Daren's magical protections and put him to sleep with a simple wave of his hand. Oh, and one more thing. He appears to be virtually undetectable when he turns invisible. I couldn't even sense a hint of his magical aura when he was hiding his presence."

"Interesting..." Azarius says, as he smashes his staff into the ground and I feel a wave of air hit me in the face. "Well, unless he also found a way to completely eliminate his physical presence from this plane, we can rest assured that he at least isn't listening to our conversation right now. I just used a sonar spell to detect all objects and persons in the area, and we are the only mages in this clearing. I also have another question for you. Do you know if he has any enemies here on this continent?"

"Yes, he does! Tyrath, the dragon I've fought in the sky a few hours ago was looking specifically for Eiden and wanted him dead. I believe that he's made an enemy of the lessathi as well. He told us to deliver a message to any ancients we find, and tell them to 'remember the still winter'. Given what I've heard you say about the still winter earlier, I can only assume that it's meant as a threat."

 "I see," the old sage says as he strokes his beard. "This could prove to be invaluable information, if we are ever to make an enemy of him ourselves. The stillwater said earlier that he wasn't participating in the tournament, but it never hurts to be too careful. Thank you for sharing this with me."

"You're welcome," I tell him.

"Master Azarius!" the mage's pupil says, as he approaches us, holding a map in his hands.

"Azarius," the sage says. "Just call me Azarius."

"Yes, master Azarius."

The sage sighs.

"Tell me, Henry, what is it?"

"I noticed that there is an unusually large concentration of magic around this area," Henry says, while pointing at the lower side of his map. "Perhaps it could be what we are looking for?"

"Perhaps..." Azarius says. "At any rate,  it's not very far from here, so I suppose we could make it there before it gets too dark to see anything. Mark the location on the map."

"Understood."

As Kate comes back with her backpack, Azarius turns to us.

 "Goodbye, my friends," he says. "I wish you all safe travels, and I hope we'll meet again."

"Goodbye, Azarius! Goodbye, Henry!" Rose says, as we all wave to them. "I'm sure that our paths will cross again someday!"

Henry looks back towards us with a surprised expression on his face. He probably isn't used to people acknowledging his existence as he travels alongside the Sage of the West. He nods curtly to Rose, and then hurries to catch up with Azarius, as they both slowly distance themselves from us and disappear into the depths of the forest.

"Hmm, I see..." Azarius says, while stroking his beard. "He said earlier that he wasn't participating in the tournament, but if he is as unpredictable as you say, then I suppose it would be wise to keep an eye out for him regardless. Thank you for sharing this information with me."

 "Well..." Kate says. "I suppose I should get going too."

Daren, Rose and I all turn to look at her simultaneously.

"I... guess this is goodbye..." she says. "We've had our ups and downs, but I'm really glad that I got to spend this short time with you. Thank you all very much for the patience you've shown me!"

She then takes a deep bow, and prepares to take her leave.

"Kate, what are you saying all of a sudden?" Rose asks her. "You do realize we're coming with you, right?"

"We are?" Daren starts to say, but I hit him in the side with my elbow. "I mean, uh... Of course we are. Naturally!"

"What?..." Kate says, shocked. "No, Rose, you can't! What about all of the sick people waiting for you in your hometown?"

"Oh, you don't need to worry about that!" Rose says. "With all of the shortcuts we've been taking so far, I am days ahead of my original schedule. I would've never had the courage to take such a direct route if you hadn't been there to escort me. Accompanying you on your way to meet your friend is the least I can do to pay you back. And besides, Hadrik said that the camp you are headed for isn't that far from here. Isn't that right, Hadrik?"

 "Aye," Hadrik answers her. "It's true!"

"There, you see?" Rose says, smiling. "Everything works out just fine!"

"But... I couldn't..." Kate starts to say, but Hadrik interrupts her.

"It's settled then!" he says loudly, completely drowning out the sound of Kate's voice. "We all go to see Kate's friend! Now come on, follow me, I'm going to try and take a shortcut."

With these final words, we all grab our backpacks, and hurry up to follow Hadrik. Kate just stands there for a few moments, unsure of what to do, but then she decides to follow him too, and before long, she starts walking side by side with us again, as if our previous discussion never even took place.

We walk in complete silence for a few minutes. Kate has always been the silent type, so I'm not really surprised about her, but I don't think I've ever seen Daren go for more than a minute without opening his mouth. He must still be in shock after what he's heard about the Beacon. He's probably still having a hard time internalizing that information, given how adamantly he's been holding on to the opinion that Kate was a banshee until now.

"Boy, you guys sure are a quiet bunch!" Hadrik says, after a few more minutes of awkward silence. "Fine, I'll break the ice, then. Come on, ask me anything!"

 "Why did you rush to defend Kate earlier in the clearing?"

"Well, I'd heard all about the Beacon from Kate's friend, and she also taught me how to differentiate between artificial mages and banshees by the feel of their magical aura. I couldn't just stand by and let a tragedy happen before my eyes because of an unfortunate misunderstanding!"

"Could you tell me how you and Diane met?" Kate asks Hadrik.

"Diane?..." the dwarf says, confused. "Oh, right, that's what your friend was called!"

"We met by chance this afternoon, while I was searching for a powerful opponent to fight. I mistook her for a banshee, and was excited at the prospect of having a one on one battle with such a strong challenger. Unfortunately for me, she proved to be a bit too powerful, and she neutralized me with a single spell. Her friends in the blue robes ordered her to finish me off, but she refused to do it. They eventually stopped trying to reason with her and told her to just make sure I don't stand in their way anymore."

"She... defied the ancients?" Kate asks, surprised.

"Aye!" Hadrik says. "When I realized that she was actually serious about sparing my life, I asked her if she was really a banshee, and that's when she told me all about the Beacon of Hope, and about artificial mages."

"Could you tell us why you like fighting so much?" Rose asks him.

 "Why does a bird flap its wings?" Hadrik says. "Why does a snake slither on the ground? I enjoy fighting because it's in my blood! My father was a warrior, and his father before him, and it goes the same for all the members of my clan." 

"Mahad selak..." I tell Hadrik.

"Mahad maktar!" he answers me, without thinking.

Hadrik then realizes the trap I've laid for him and starts laughing loudly.

"I'm sorry, I do not understand..." Rose says.

"Glory in life, glory in death," I translate to her. "Many of the giants on the Northern Continent live and die by this credo, and some of the clans even use this as a salute between members. I read about it once in a book that described the races and culture of the Northern Continent."

 "What?!" Daren asks, utterly shocked.

"That's some really impressive deductive skills there, Barry," Hadrik tells me. "How did you figure it out?"

"Well, ever since I saw you in the clearing, I could tell by your magical aura that you were already shapeshifting. But shapeshifting magic can only be used to modify your size or to transform yourself into another creature. You cannot use it to disguise yourself as someone else. So I figured that you needed to have some sort of reason to make yourself seem smaller than you actually were. It was then that I remembered your giant form from when you first called out to us. Normally it should be impossible for someone to transform himself into a giant, because it would break the laws of shapeshifting. That made me realize that it must have been the other way around, and that the giant form was actually your original form."

Hadrik laughs again.

"Well, you found out my secret," he says. "What are you going to do now? Will you report me to the organizers so that they can kick me out of the tournament? Are you going to use this information to blackmail me into helping you with the objectives?"  

 "What?" I ask him. "No, don't be ridiculous. If I did any of that, then what were to stop you from also reporting me for having joined this mage tournament as an ordinary human? The reality is that the organizers likely just don't care. They didn't even bother to do some minimal screening of the contestants, and let hundreds of ordinary people like me join this tournament without even considering the implications. Why would they care if they also let in a giant or two?"

"I think you may be right," Hadrik says. "Well, I guess that's enough questions for now. If we go on like this, I may well end up giving away my home address. Hahahahaha!"

As we advance through the forest, we start seeing some bright yellow lights circling around the trees.  

"What are these, I wonder?" I ask, as I point towards one of the yellow lights. "Overgrown fireflies?"

"Oh..." Rose says. "Oh, no... This isn't good. We need to get out of this place as fast as possible."

As the woman who appears to be Kate's friend reveals herself to us, we see that she has a rather muscular physique, although it doesn't by any means make her look unattractive. She has blue eyes, and short, blond hair that's standing up on her head, likely as a side-effect of her electrical powers. She is wearing tight leather pants and a gray tank top shirt, while her age seems to be close to that of Kate. She also has a burn scar on her left arm, which is likely a souvenir from a hard-fought battle.

"Diane!" Kate says, unable to contain her joy. "I can't believe it's really you... You don't know how long I've been trying to find--"

"I don't need to be saved!" Diane says, as she points at her neck, in order to show Kate that she is no longer wearing a collar. "I am working with them of my own free will."

"What?... But, why? I don't understand..."

"It doesn't matter! What matters is that you need to get out of here. Quick! Before the ancients come back. And stop looking for me! Please..."

"No!" Kate shouts. "I'm not leaving here without you!"

"Yes, you are," Diane says, as her eyes start glowing bright, and electrical currents start forming around her.

"Kate, maybe we should retreat for now," I tell her, as I start to feel the hair on my skin stand up from the static electricity around me.

"No!" Kate says. "If she doesn't plan to see reason until I beat some sense into her stupid head, then I'll--"

Before Kate gets to finish her sentence, there's a sudden powerful surge of electricity in the air around us, which shocks us all violently and then makes us fall to the ground in unison.

"No!" Kate shouts. "I'm not leaving here without you!"

"Yes, you are," Diane says, as her eyes start glowing bright, and electrical currents start forming around her.

"Kate, maybe we should retreat for now," I tell her, as I start to feel the hair on my skin stand up from the static electricity around me.

"No!" Kate says. "If she doesn't plan to see reason until I beat some sense into her stupid head, then I'll--"

Before Kate gets to finish her sentence, there's a sudden powerful surge of electricity in the air around us, which shocks us all violently and then makes us fall to the ground in unison. Out of the five of us, I appear to be the only one who still maintained his consciousness, although I can barely move.

 "Not allowed by whom?"

"The great golden fox. She is the strongest of the guardian spirits, and she is not known for her merciful nature."

"And why is it that we aren't allowed to be here?"

"Because only animals are allowed in the sacred woods. Please, there's no time to talk! We need to get out of here before it's too lat--"

"Kate?..." we hear a woman's voice, coming from behind a tree. "Kate, is that you?"

As the woman who appears to be Kate's friend reveals herself to us, we see that she has a rather muscular physique, although it doesn't by any means make her look unattractive. She has blue eyes, and short, blond hair that's standing up on her head, likely as a side-effect of her electrical powers. She is wearing tight leather pants and a gray tank top shirt, while her age seems to be close to that of Kate. She also has a burn scar on her left arm, which is likely a souvenir from a hard-fought battle.

"Diane!" Kate says, unable to contain her joy. "I can't believe it's really you... You don't know how long I've been trying to find--"

"You IDIOT!" Diane shouts, immediately silencing Kate. "Why did you come back? You aren't supposed to be here!"

 "Diane, listen to me, I came back here to save you... I came back here to take you away from this place."

"I don't need to be saved!" Diane says, as she points at her neck, in order to show Kate that she is no longer wearing a collar. "I am working with them of my own free will."

"What?... But, why? I don't understand..."

"It doesn't matter! What matters is that you need to get out of here. Quick! Before the ancients come back. And stop looking for me! Please..."

"No!" Kate shouts. "I'm not leaving here without you!"

"Yes, you are," Diane says, as her eyes start glowing bright, and electrical currents start forming around her.

"Kate, maybe we should retreat for now," I tell her, as I start to feel the hair on my skin stand up from the static electricity around me.

 As I look towards Diane, I can see two men in dark blue robes approach from behind her. They are both wearing their hoods, so I can't see their faces clearly.

"What's going on, here?" asks the man on the right. "More intruders?"

"Look," says the one on the left. "One of them is that dwarf she refused to kill this afternoon. He's brought his friends with him this time."

He turns to Diane.

"Well? What are you waiting for? Finish them off! Or are you waiting for them to bring even more friends to take their revenge on us?"

"No!" she says. "I won't kill them."

"Typical," says the man on the right. "Move over. I'll finish them myself."

"If you dare to lay even a finger on them, I will murder you here and now," Diane says.

"You dare threaten me, wench? Don't you realize what position you are in?"

"Stop it, Zenir," says the man on the left as he puts his hand on the other's shoulder. "You know full well that we are no match for her in battle. Come on, let's make preparations for our departure. We shouldn't linger here for much longer, now that our location has been compromised."

 "You're right," says Zenir as he calms down. "We should get ready to leave here as soon as possible."

He then points menacingly towards Diane and says:

"Lady Meridith will hear of this, I assure you!"

"I'm counting on it," Diane says, smiling defiantly.

Zenir frowns, and then he goes to follow his ally back to their main camp. Once the two of them are no longer visible, Diane turns back towards the five of us, and she notices that I'm still conscious.

"You are still awake?" she says, as she approaches me. "Strange... That high a voltage should have normally made you all lose your consciousness. So why are you the only one that was able to maintain his awareness?"

When she gets closer to me, she looks shocked for a brief moment, and then she smiles.

"I see," she says. "You are a lessathi. Kate must really trust you if she's willing to travel with you despite this fact."

"Wait," I start to tell her. "Why are you--"

"Take good care of her, will you?" Diane says, smiling, as she puts a finger on my forehead. "I'm counting on you to keep her safe from now on!"

She then sends a surge of electricity throughout my entire body, and the last thing I see is her sad smile, as I slowly lose my consciousness and everything goes dark.
